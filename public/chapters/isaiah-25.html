</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Indeed, You have made the city a heap of rubble, </p><p class="indent"> the fortified town a ruin. </p><p class="indent1"> The fortress of strangers is a city no more; </p><p class="indent"> it will never be rebuilt.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore, a strong people will honour You. </p><p class="indent"> The cities of ruthless nations will revere You.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>For You have been a refuge for the poor, </p><p class="indent"> a stronghold for the needy in distress, </p><p class="indent1"> a refuge from the storm, </p><p class="indent"> a shade from the heat. </p><p class="indent1"> For the breath of the ruthless </p><p class="indent"> is like rain against a wall,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>like heat in a dry land. </p><p class="indent"> You subdue the uproar of foreigners. </p><p class="indent1"> As the shade of a cloud cools the heat, </p><p class="indent"> so the song of the ruthless is silenced.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>On this mountain the LORD of Hosts </p><p class="indent"> will prepare a banquet for all the peoples, </p><p class="indent1"> a feast of aged wine, of choice meat, </p><p class="indent"> of finely aged wine.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>On this mountain He will swallow up </p><p class="indent"> the shroud that enfolds all peoples, </p><p class="indent"> the sheet that covers all nations;
