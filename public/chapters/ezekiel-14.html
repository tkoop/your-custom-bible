<font ><b>Idolatrous Elders Condemned</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then some of the elders of Israel came and
sat down before me. And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Son
of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked
stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I consult with them in
any way? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore speak to them and tell them that
this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘When any Israelite sets up idols
in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face, and
then comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him according to
his great idolatry, so that I may take hold of the hearts of the
people of Israel. For because of their idols, they are all estranged
from Me.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore tell the house of Israel that
this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Repent and turn away from your
idols; turn your faces away from all your abominations. For when any
Israelite or any foreigner dwelling in Israel separates himself from
Me, sets up idols in his heart, and puts a wicked stumbling block
before his face, and then comes to the prophet to inquire of Me, I
the LORD will answer him Myself. I will set My face against that man
and make him a sign and a proverb; I will cut him off from among My
people. Then you will know that I am the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if the prophet is enticed to speak a
message, then it was I the LORD who enticed him, and I will stretch
out My hand against him and destroy him from among My people Israel.
They will bear their punishment—the punishment of the inquirer will
be the same as that of the prophet— in order that the house of
Israel may no longer stray from Me and no longer defile themselves
with all their transgressions. Then they will be My people and I will
be their God, declares the Lord GOD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, if a land sins against Me by acting
unfaithfully, and I stretch out My hand against it to cut off its
supply of food, to send famine upon it, and to cut off from it both
man and beast, then even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and
Job—were in it, their righteousness could deliver only themselves,
declares the Lord GOD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Or if I send wild beasts through the land
to leave it childless and desolate, with no man passing through it
for fear of the beasts, then as surely as I live, declares the Lord
GOD, even if these three men were in it, they could not deliver their
own sons or daughters. They alone would be delivered, but the land
would be desolate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Or if I bring a sword against that land
and say, ‘Let a sword pass through it,’ so that I cut off from it
both man and beast, then as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD,
even if these three men were in it, they could not deliver their own
sons or daughters. They alone would be delivered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Or if I send a plague into that land and
pour out My wrath upon it through bloodshed, cutting off from it both
man and beast, then as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, even
if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they could not deliver their own
sons or daughters. Their righteousness could deliver only themselves.

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘How
much worse will it be when I send against Jerusalem My four dire
judgments—sword, famine, wild beasts, and plague—in order to cut
off from it both man and beast? </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet, behold, some survivors will be left
in it—sons and daughters who will be brought out. They will come
out to you, and when you see their conduct and actions, you will be
comforted regarding the disaster I have brought upon Jerusalem—all
that I have brought upon it. They will bring you consolation when you
see their conduct and actions, and you will know that it was not
without cause that I have done all these things within it,’
declares the Lord GOD.” </font>
