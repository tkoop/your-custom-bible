<span class="reftext">2</span>And the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">3</span>“Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces. Should I consult with them in any way?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Therefore speak to them and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘When any Israelite sets up idols in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face, and then comes to the prophet, I <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will answer him according to his great idolatry,
<span class="reftext">5</span>so that I may take hold of the hearts of the people of Israel. For because of their idols, they are all estranged from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore tell the house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Repent and turn away from <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> idols; turn <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faces away from all <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> abominations.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For when any Israelite or any foreigner dwelling in Israel separates himself from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, sets up idols in his heart, and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face, and then comes to the prophet to inquire of <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, I <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will answer him <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span>.
<span class="reftext">8</span>I will set <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> face against that man and make him a sign and a proverb; I will cut him off from among <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>But if the prophet is enticed to speak a message, then it was I <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> who enticed him, and I will stretch out <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> hand against him and destroy him from among <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people Israel.
<span class="reftext">10</span>They will bear their punishment—the punishment of the inquirer will be the same as that of the prophet—
<span class="reftext">11</span>in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and no longer defile themselves with all their transgressions. Then they will be <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people and I will be their God, declares the Lord GOD.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
