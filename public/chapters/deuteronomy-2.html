<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then we turned back and headed for the
wilderness by way of the Red Sea, as the LORD had instructed me, and
for many days we wandered around Mount Seir. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At this time the LORD said to me, “You
have been wandering around this hill country long enough; turn to the
north and command the people: ‘You will pass through the territory
of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They
will be afraid of you, so you must be very careful. Do not provoke
them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even a
footprint, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as his possession.
You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you
drink.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Indeed, the LORD your God has blessed you
in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey
through this vast wilderness. The LORD your God has been with you
these forty years, and you have lacked nothing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So we passed by our brothers, the
descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned away from the Arabah
road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion-geber, and traveled along
the road of the Wilderness of Moab. Then the LORD said to me, “Do
not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give
you any of their land, because I have given Ar to the descendants of
Lot as their possession.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">(The Emites used to live there, a people
great and many, as tall as the Anakites. Like the Anakites, they were
also regarded as Rephaim, though the Moabites called them Emites. The
Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them
out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their
place, just as Israel did in the land that the LORD gave them as
their possession.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now arise and cross over the Brook of
Zered.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So we crossed over the Brook of Zered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The time we spent traveling from
Kadesh-barnea until we crossed over the Brook of Zered was
thirty-eight years, until that entire generation of fighting men had
perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them. Indeed, the
LORD’s hand was against them, to eliminate them from the camp,
until they had all perished. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when all the fighting men among the
people had died, the LORD said to me, “Today you are going to cross
the border of Moab at Ar. But when you get close to the Ammonites, do
not harass them or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the
land of the Ammonites. I have given it to the descendants of Lot as
their possession.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">(That too was regarded as the land of the
Rephaim, who used to live there, though the Ammonites called them
Zamzummites. They were a people great and many, as tall as the
Anakites. But the LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who
drove them out and settled in their place, just as He had done for
the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, when He destroyed the
Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their
place to this day. And the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as
Gaza, were destroyed by the Caphtorites, who came out of Caphtor and
settled in their place.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Arise, set out, and cross the Arnon
Valley. See, I have delivered into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king
of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession of it and engage
him in battle. This very day I will begin to put the dread and fear
of you upon all the nations under heaven. They will hear the reports
of you and tremble in anguish because of you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So from the Wilderness of Kedemoth I sent
messengers with an offer of peace to Sihon king of Heshbon, saying,
“Let us pass through your land; we will stay on the main road. We
will not turn to the right or to the left. You can sell us food to
eat and water to drink in exchange for silver. Only let us pass
through on foot, just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir and
the Moabites who live in Ar did for us, until we cross the Jordan
into the land that the LORD our God is giving us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us
pass through, for the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and
his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into your hand, as is
the case this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to me, “See, I have
begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you. Now begin to conquer
and possess his land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Sihon and his whole army came out for
battle against us at Jahaz. And the LORD our God delivered him over
to us, and we defeated him and his sons and his whole army. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time we captured all his cities
and devoted to destruction the people of every city, including women
and children. We left no survivors. We carried off for ourselves only
the livestock and the plunder from the cities we captured. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley,
along with the city in the valley, even as far as Gilead, not one
city had walls too high for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them.
But you did not go near the land of the Ammonites, or the land along
the banks of the Jabbok River, or the cities of the hill country, or
any place that the LORD our God had forbidden. </font>
