9</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Plagues of Livestock, Boils, and
Hail</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to
Pharaoh and tell him that this is what the LORD, the God of the
Hebrews, says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may worship Me. But
if you continue to restrain them and refuse to let them go, then the
hand of the LORD will bring a severe plague on your livestock in the
field—on your horses, donkeys, camels, herds, and flocks. But the
LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the
livestock of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites
will die.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD set a time, saying, “Tomorrow
the LORD will do this in the land.” And the next day the LORD did
just that. All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one
animal belonging to the Israelites died. Pharaoh sent officials and
found that none of the livestock of the Israelites had died. But
Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would not let the people go. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
“Take handfuls of soot from the furnace; in the sight of Pharaoh,
Moses is to toss it into the air. It will become fine dust over all
the land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on man and
beast throughout the land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they took soot from the furnace and
stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering
boils broke out on man and beast. The magicians could not stand
before Moses, because the boils had broken out on them and on all the
Egyptians. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart,
and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said to Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up
early in the morning, stand before Pharaoh, and tell him that this is
what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘Let My people go, so
that they may worship Me. Otherwise, I will send all My plagues
against you and your officials and your people, so you may know that
there is no one like Me in all the earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For by this time I could have stretched
out My hand and struck you and your people with a plague to wipe you
off the earth. But I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I
might display My power to you, and that My name might be proclaimed
in all the earth. Still, you lord it over My people and do not allow
them to go. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Behold, at this time tomorrow I will rain
down the worst hail that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it
was founded until now. So give orders now to shelter your livestock
and everything you have in the field. Every man or beast that remains
in the field and is not brought inside will die when the hail comes
down upon them.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Those among Pharaoh’s officials who
feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their servants and
livestock to shelter, but those who disregarded the word of the LORD
left their servants and livestock in the field. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch
out your hand toward heaven, so that hail may fall on all the land of
Egypt—on man and beast and every plant of the field throughout the
land of Egypt.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Moses stretched out his staff toward
heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning struck the
earth. So the LORD rained down hail upon the land of Egypt. The hail
fell and the lightning continued flashing through it. The hail was so
severe that nothing like it had ever been seen in all the land of
Egypt from the time it became a nation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Throughout the land of Egypt, the hail
struck down everything in the field, both man and beast; it beat down
every plant of the field and stripped every tree. The only place
where it did not hail was in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites
lived. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron.
“This time I have sinned,” he said. “The LORD is righteous, and
I and my people are wicked. Pray to the LORD, for there has been
enough of God’s thunder and hail. I will let you go; you do not
need to stay any longer.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moses said to him, “When I have left the
city, I will spread out my hands to the LORD. The thunder will cease,
and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth
is the LORD’s. But as for you and your officials, I know that you
still do not fear the LORD our God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">(Now the flax and barley were destroyed,
since the barley was ripe and the flax was in bloom; but the wheat
and spelt were not destroyed, because they are late crops.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Moses departed from Pharaoh, went out
of the city, and spread out his hands to the LORD. The thunder and
hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured down on the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail
and thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart—he
and his officials. So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he would
not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses. </font>
