<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Complaints of the People</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Soon the people began to complain about their hardship in the hearing of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and when He heard them, His anger was kindled, and fire from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> blazed among them and consumed the outskirts of the camp.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And the people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and the fire died down.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So that place was called Taberah,<span class="fn">a</span>  because the fire of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had burned among them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Meanwhile, the rabble among them had a strong craving for other food, and again the Israelites wept and said, “Who will feed us meat?
<span class="reftext">5</span>We remember the fish we ate freely in Egypt, along with the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But now our appetite is gone; there is nothing to see but this manna!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now the manna resembled coriander seed, and its appearance was like that of gum resin.
<span class="reftext">8</span>The people walked around and gathered it, ground it on a handmill or crushed it in a mortar, then boiled it in a cooking pot or shaped it into cakes. It tasted like pastry baked with fine oil.
<span class="reftext">9</span>When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it.
</p><p class="hdg">The Complaint of Moses</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then Moses heard the people of family after family weeping at the entrances to their tents, and the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was kindled greatly, and Moses was also displeased.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So Moses asked <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “Why have You brought this trouble on Your servant? Why have I not found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in Your sight, that You have laid upon me the burden of all these people?
<span class="reftext">12</span>Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth, so that You should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries an infant,’ to the land that You swore to give their fathers?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Where can I get meat for all these people? For they keep crying out to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I cannot carry all these people by myself; it is too burdensome for me.
<span class="reftext">15</span>If this is how You are going to treat me, please kill me right now—if I have found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in Your eyes—and let me not see my own wretchedness.”
</p><p class="hdg">Seventy Elders Anointed</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses, “Bring Me seventy of the elders of Israel known to you as leaders and officers of the people. Bring them to the Tent of Meeting and have them stand there with you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>And I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put that Spirit on them. They will help you bear the burden of the people, so that you do not have to bear it by yourself.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And say to the people: Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you will eat meat, because you have cried out in the hearing of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, saying: ‘Who will feed us meat? For we were better off in Egypt!’ Therefore <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will give you meat, and you will eat.
<span class="reftext">19</span>You will eat it not for one or two days, nor for five or ten or twenty days,
<span class="reftext">20</span>but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and makes you nauseous—because you have rejected <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, who is among you, and have cried out before Him, saying, ‘Why did we ever leave Egypt?’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>But Moses replied, “Here I am among 600,000 men on foot, yet You say, ‘I will give them meat, and they will eat for a month.’
<span class="reftext">22</span>If all our flocks and herds were slaughtered for them, would they have enough? Or if all the fish in the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> answered Moses, “Is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s arm too short? Now you will see whether or not My word will come to pass.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So Moses went out and relayed to the people the words of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and he gathered seventy of the elders of the people and had them stand around the tent.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and He took some of the Spirit that was on Moses and placed that Spirit on the seventy elders. As the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but they never did so again.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Two men, however, had remained in the camp—one named Eldad and the other Medad—and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those listed, but they had not gone out to the tent, and they prophesied in the camp.
<span class="reftext">27</span>A young man ran and reported to Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Joshua son of Nun, the attendant to Moses since youth, spoke up and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>But Moses replied, “Are you jealous on my account? I wish that all <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s people were prophets and that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> would place His Spirit on them!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Then Moses returned to the camp, along with the elders of Israel.
</p><p class="hdg">The Quail and the Plague</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Now a wind sent by <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came up, drove in quail from the sea, and brought them near the camp, about two cubits above the surface of the ground,<span class="fn">b</span>  for a day’s journey in every direction around the camp.
<span class="reftext">32</span>All that day and night, and all the next day, the people stayed up gathering the quail. No one gathered less than ten homers,<span class="fn">c</span>  and they spread them out all around the camp.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against the people, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> struck them with a severe plague.
<span class="reftext">34</span>So they called that place Kibroth-hattaavah,<span class="fn">d</span>  because there they buried the people who had craved other food.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>From Kibroth-hattaavah the people moved on to Hazeroth, where they remained for some time.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Taberah</i> means <i class="calibre6">burning</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">up to two cubits deep</i>; that is, approximately 3 feet or 91.4 centimeters<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">32</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">10 homers</i> is approximately 62.4 bushels or 2,200 liters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">34</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Kibroth-hattaavah</i> means <i class="calibre6">graves of craving</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
