<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Elisha said, “Hear the word of the
LORD! This is what the LORD says: ‘About this time tomorrow at the
gate of Samaria, a seah of fine flour will sell for a shekel, and two
seahs of barley will sell for a shekel.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the officer on whose arm the king
leaned answered the man of God, “Look, even if the LORD were to
make windows in heaven, could this really happen?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You will see it with your own eyes,”
replied Elisha, “but you will not eat any of it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now there were four men with leprosy at
the entrance of the city gate, and they said to one another, “Why
just sit here until we die? If we say, ‘Let us go into the city,’
we will die there from the famine in the city; but if we sit here, we
will also die. So come now, let us go over to the camp of the
Arameans. If they let us live, we will live; if they kill us, we will
die.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they arose at twilight and went to the
camp of the Arameans. But when they came to the outskirts of the
camp, there was not a man to be found. For the Lord had caused the
Arameans to hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a great army, so
that they said to one another, “Look, the king of Israel must have
hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Thus the Arameans had arisen and fled at
twilight, abandoning their tents and horses and donkeys. The camp was
intact, and they had run for their lives. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the lepers reached the edge of the
camp, they went into a tent to eat and drink. Then they carried off
the silver, gold, and clothing, and went and hid them. On returning,
they entered another tent, carried off some items from there, and hid
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Finally, they said to one another, “We
are not doing what is right. Today is a day of good news. If we are
silent and wait until morning light, our sin will overtake us. Now,
therefore, let us go and tell the king’s household.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they went and called out to the
gatekeepers of the city, saying, “We went to the Aramean camp and
no one was there—not a trace—only tethered horses and donkeys,
and the tents were intact.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it
was reported to the king’s household. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king got up in the night and said
to his servants, “Let me tell you what the Arameans have done to
us. They know we are starving, so they have left the camp to hide in
the field, thinking, ‘When they come out of the city, we will take
them alive and enter the city.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But one of his servants replied, “Please,
have scouts take five of the horses that remain in the city. Their
plight will be no worse than all the Israelites who are left here.
You can see that all the Israelites here are doomed. So let us send
them and find out.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the scouts took two chariots with
horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army, saying, “Go
and see.” And they tracked them as far as the Jordan, and indeed,
the whole way was littered with the clothing and equipment the
Arameans had thrown off in haste. So the scouts returned and told the
king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the people went out and plundered the
camp of the Arameans. It was then that a seah of fine flour sold for
a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, according to the
word of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the king had appointed the officer on
whose arm he leaned to be in charge of the gate, but the people
trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had
foretold when the king had come to him. It happened just as the man
of God had told the king: “About this time tomorrow at the gate of
Samaria, two seahs of barley will sell for a shekel, and a seah of
fine flour will sell for a shekel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the officer had answered the man of
God, “Look, even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could
this really happen?” </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And that is just what happened to him. The
people trampled him in the gateway, and he died. </font>
