<span class="reftext">2</span>and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Now get up, disguise yourself so they will not <span class='spell ca'>recognize</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognize</span> you as my wife, and go to Shiloh. For Ahijah the prophet is there; it was he who spoke about my kingship over this people.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the boy.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Jeroboam’s wife did as instructed; she arose and went to Shiloh and arrived at Ahijah’s house. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age.
<span class="reftext">5</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had said to Ahijah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill. You are to say such and such to her, because when she arrives, she will be disguised.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet entering the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you disguised? For I have been sent to you with bad news.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘I raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people Israel.
<span class="reftext">8</span>I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you. But you were not like <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> servant David, who kept <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> commandments and followed <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> with all his heart, doing only what was right in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> eyes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>You have done more evil than all who came before you. You have proceeded to make for yourself other gods and molten images to provoke <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, and you have flung <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> behind your back.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Because of all this, behold, I am bringing disaster on the house of Jeroboam: </p><p class="indent1stline"> I will cut off from Jeroboam every male,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> both slave and free, </p><p class="indent"> in Israel; </p><p class="indent1"> I will burn up the house of Jeroboam </p><p class="indent"> as one burns up dung until it is gone!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city </p><p class="indent"> will be eaten by dogs, </p><p class="indent1"> and anyone who dies in the field </p><p class="indent"> will be eaten by the birds of the air.’ </p><p class="selah"> For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has spoken.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>As for you, get up and go home. When your feet enter the city, the child will die.
<span class="reftext">13</span>All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. For this is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will receive a proper burial,<span class="fn">b</span>  because only in him has <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, found any good in the house of Jeroboam.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Moreover, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will raise up for <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is the day—yes, even today!
<span class="reftext">15</span>For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> gave their fathers, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will scatter them beyond the Euphrates,<span class="fn">c</span>  because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to anger.
<span class="reftext">16</span>So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will give Israel over on account of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then Jeroboam’s wife got up and departed for Tirzah, and as soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And they buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had spoken through <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> servant Ahijah the prophet.
</p><p class="hdg">Nadab Succeeds Jeroboam</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>As for the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he waged war and how he reigned, they are indeed written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And the length of Jeroboam’s reign was twenty-two years, and he rested with his fathers, and his son Nadab reigned in his place.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And Judah did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and by the sins they committed they provoked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> to jealous anger more than all their fathers had done.
<span class="reftext">23</span>They also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
<span class="reftext">24</span>There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land. They imitated all the abominations of the nations <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had driven out before the Israelites.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and committed them to the care of the captains of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
