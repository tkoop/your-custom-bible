<font ><b>Ahijah’s Prophecy against Jeroboam</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became
ill, and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Now get up, disguise yourself
so they will not recognize you as my wife, and go to Shiloh. For
Ahijah the prophet is there; it was he who spoke about my kingship
over this people. Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and
a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of
the boy.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jeroboam’s wife did as instructed; she
arose and went to Shiloh and arrived at Ahijah’s house. Now Ahijah
could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age. But the LORD
had said to Ahijah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask
you about her son, for he is ill. You are to say such and such to
her, because when she arrives, she will be disguised.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet
entering the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you
disguised? For I have been sent to you with bad news. Go, tell
Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I
raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over My
people Israel. I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and
gave it to you. But you were not like My servant David, who kept My
commandments and followed Me with all his heart, doing only what was
right in My eyes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You have done more evil than all who came
before you. You have proceeded to make for yourself other gods and
molten images to provoke Me, and you have flung Me behind your back.
Because of all this, behold, I am bringing disaster on the house of
Jeroboam: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will cut off from Jeroboam every male, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >both slave and free, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >in Israel; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will burn up the house of Jeroboam </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >as one burns up dung until it is gone! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in
the city </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >will be eaten by dogs, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and anyone who dies in the field </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >will be eaten by the birds of the air.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="right" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<i><font >For the LORD has spoken. </font></i>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for you, get up and go home. When your
feet enter the city, the child will die. All Israel will mourn for
him and bury him. For this is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who
will receive a proper burial, because only in him has the LORD, the
God of Israel, found any good in the house of Jeroboam. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, the LORD will raise up for
Himself a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam.
This is the day—yes, even today! For the LORD will strike Israel as
a reed is shaken in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good
land that He gave their fathers, and He will scatter them beyond the
Euphrates, because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking the
LORD to anger. So He will give Israel over on account of the sins
Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jeroboam’s wife got up and departed
for Tirzah, and as soon as she stepped over the threshold of the
house, the boy died. And they buried him, and all Israel mourned for
him, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through His
servant Ahijah the prophet. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Jeroboam,
how he waged war and how he reigned, they are indeed written in the
Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the length of Jeroboam’s reign was
twenty-two years, and he rested with his fathers, and his son Nadab
reigned in his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned
in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he
reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen
from all the tribes of Israel in which to put His Name. His mother’s
name was Naamah the Ammonite. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Judah did evil in the sight of the
LORD, and by the sins they committed they provoked Him to jealous
anger more than all their fathers had done. They also built for
themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every
high hill and under every green tree. There were even male shrine
prostitutes in the land. They imitated all the abominations of the
nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign,
Shishak king of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem. He seized the
treasures of the house of the LORD and of the royal palace. He took
everything, including all the gold shields that Solomon had made. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in
their place and committed them to the care of the captains of the
guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. And whenever the
king entered the house of the LORD, the guards would bear the
shields, and later they would return them to the guardroom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Rehoboam,
along with all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the
Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There was war between Rehoboam and
Jeroboam throughout their days. And Rehoboam rested with his fathers
and was buried with them in the City of David; his mother’s name
was Naamah the Ammonite. And his son Abijam reigned in his place. </font>
