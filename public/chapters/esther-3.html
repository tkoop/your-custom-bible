<font ><b>Haman’s Plot against the Jews</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After these events, King Xerxes honored
Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him to a position
above all the princes who were with him. All the royal servants at
the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, because the
king had commanded that this be done for him. But Mordecai would not
bow down or pay homage. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the royal servants at the king’s
gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the command of the king?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Day after day they warned him, but he
would not comply. So they reported it to Haman to see whether
Mordecai’s behavior would be tolerated, since he had told them he
was a Jew. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow
down or pay him homage, he was filled with rage. And when he learned
the identity of Mordecai’s people, he scorned the notion of laying
hands on Mordecai alone. Instead, he sought to destroy all of
Mordecai’s people, the Jews, throughout the kingdom of Xerxes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the
first month, the month of Nisan, the Pur (that is, the lot) was cast
before Haman to determine a day and month. And the lot fell on the
twelfth month, the month of Adar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Haman informed King Xerxes, “There
is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples of
every province of your kingdom. Their laws are different from
everyone else’s, and they do not obey the king’s laws. So it is
not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them. If it pleases the
king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will deposit ten
thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury to pay those who
carry it out.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king removed the signet ring from
his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the
enemy of the Jews. “Keep your money,” said the king to Haman.
“These people are given to you to do with them as you please.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the thirteenth day of the first month,
the royal scribes were summoned and the order was written exactly as
Haman commanded the royal satraps, the governors of each province,
and the officials of each people, in the script of each province and
the language of every people. It was written in the name of King
Xerxes and sealed with the royal signet ring. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the letters were sent by couriers to
each of the royal provinces with the order to destroy, kill, and
annihilate all the Jews—young and old, women and children—and to
plunder their possessions on a single day, the thirteenth day of
Adar, the twelfth month. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A copy of the text of the edict was to be
issued in every province and published to all the people, so that
they would be ready on that day. The couriers left, spurred on by the
king’s command, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa.
Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was
in confusion. </font>
