<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On one occasion, while Jesus was standing
by the Lake of Gennesaret with the crowd pressing in on Him to hear
the word of God, He saw two boats at the edge of the lake. The
fishermen had left them and were washing their nets. Jesus got into
the boat belonging to Simon and asked him to put out a little from
shore. And sitting down, He taught the people from the boat. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus had finished speaking, He said
to Simon, <font color="#a80000">“Put out into deep water and let
down your nets for a catch.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Master,” Simon replied, “we have
worked hard all night without catching anything. But because You say
so, I will let down the nets.” When they had done so, they caught
such a large number of fish that their nets began to tear. So they
signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them,
and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at
Jesus’ knees. “Go away from me, Lord,” he said, “for I am a
sinful man.” For he and his companions were astonished at the catch
of fish they had taken, and so were his partners James and John, the
sons of Zebedee. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Do not be
afraid,”</font> Jesus said to Simon. <font color="#a80000">“From
now on you will catch men.”</font> And when they had brought their
boats ashore, they left everything and followed Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man
came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell
facedown and begged Him, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me
clean.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus reached out His hand and touched the
man. <font color="#a80000">“I am willing,”</font> He said. <font color="#a80000">“Be
clean!”</font> And immediately the leprosy left him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Do not tell
anyone,”</font> Jesus instructed him. <font color="#a80000">“But
go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses
prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the news about Jesus spread all the
more, and great crowds came to hear Him and to be healed of their
sicknesses. Yet He frequently withdrew to the wilderness to pray. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One day Jesus was teaching, and the
Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. People had come
from Jerusalem and from every village of Galilee and Judea, and the
power of the Lord was present for Him to heal the sick. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Just then some men came carrying a
paralyzed man on a mat. They tried to bring him inside to set him
before Jesus, but they could not find a way through the crowd. So
they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles
into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus saw their faith, He said,
<font color="#a80000">“Friend, your sins are forgiven.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the scribes and Pharisees began
thinking to themselves, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemy? Who
can forgive sins but God alone?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Knowing what they were thinking, Jesus
replied, <font color="#a80000">“Why are you thinking these things
in your hearts? Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’
or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’ But so that you may know that the
Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins...”</font> He
said to the paralytic, <font color="#a80000">“I tell you, get up,
pick up your mat, and go home.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And immediately the man stood up before
them, took what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God.
Everyone was taken with amazement and glorified God. They were filled
with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax
collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth. <font color="#a80000">“Follow
Me,”</font> He told him, and Levi got up, left everything, and
followed Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Levi hosted a great banquet for Jesus
at his house. A large crowd of tax collectors was there, along with
others who were eating with them. But the Pharisees and their scribes
complained to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with
tax collectors and sinners?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“It
is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come
to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they said to Him, “John’s
disciples and those of the Pharisees frequently fast and pray, but
Yours keep on eating and drinking.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Can
you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while He is with them? But
the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then
they will fast.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He also told them a parable: <font color="#a80000">“No
one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old
one. If he does, he will tear the new garment as well, and the patch
from the new will not match the old.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >And no one pours new
wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the
skins, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined.
Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins. And no one after
drinking old wine wants new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
