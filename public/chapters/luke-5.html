<span class="reftext">2</span>He saw two boats at the edge of the lake. The fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Jesus got into the boat belonging to Simon and asked him to put out a little from shore. And sitting down, He taught the people from the boat.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When Jesus had finished speaking, He said to Simon, <span>“Put out into deep water and let down your nets for a catch.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>“Master,” Simon replied, “we have worked hard all night without catching anything. But because You say so, I will let down the nets.”
<span class="reftext">6</span>When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to tear.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So they <span class='spell ca'>signalled</span><span class='spell gb'>signalled</span><span class='spell us'>signaled</span> to their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees. “Go away from me, Lord,” he said, “for I am a sinful man.”
<span class="reftext">9</span>For he and his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,
<span class="reftext">10</span>and so were his partners James and John, the sons of Zebedee. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“Do not be afraid,”</span> Jesus said to Simon. <span>“From now on you will catch men.”</span>
<span class="reftext">11</span>And when they had brought their boats ashore, they left everything and followed Him.
</p><p class="hdg">The Leper’s Prayer<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Leviticus 14:1–32; Matthew 8:1–4; Mark 1:40–45)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy.<span class="fn">b</span>  When he saw Jesus, he fell facedown and begged Him, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. <span>“I am willing,”</span> He said. <span>“Be clean!”</span> And immediately the leprosy left him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">14</span>“Do not tell anyone,”</span> Jesus instructed him. <span>“But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”<span class="fn">c</span> </span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>But the news about Jesus spread all the more, and great crowds came to hear Him and to be healed of their sicknesses.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Yet He frequently withdrew to the wilderness to pray.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals a Paralytic<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 9:1–8; Mark 2:1–12)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>One day Jesus was teaching, and the Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. People had come from Jerusalem and from every village of Galilee and Judea, and the power of the Lord was present for Him to heal the sick.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Just then some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. They tried to bring him inside to set him before Jesus,
<span class="reftext">19</span>but they could not find a way through the crowd. So they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>When Jesus saw their faith, He said, <span>“Friend, your sins are forgiven.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>But the scribes and Pharisees began thinking to themselves, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Knowing what they were thinking, Jesus replied, <span>“Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
<span class="reftext">23</span>Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’
<span class="reftext">24</span>But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins...”</span> He said to the paralytic, <span>“I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>And immediately the man stood up before them, took what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Everyone was taken with amazement and glorified God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Calls Levi<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 9:9–13; Mark 2:13–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth. <span>“Follow Me,”</span> He told him,
<span class="reftext">28</span>and Levi got up, left everything, and followed Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Then Levi hosted a great banquet for Jesus at his house. A large crowd of tax collectors was there, along with others who were eating with them.
<span class="reftext">30</span>But the Pharisees and their scribes complained to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Jesus answered, <span>“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
<span class="reftext">32</span>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Questions about Fasting<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 9:14–15; Mark 2:18–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Then they said to Him, “John’s disciples and those of the Pharisees frequently fast and pray, but Yours keep on eating and drinking.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while He is with them?
<span class="reftext">35</span>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Patches and the Wineskins<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 9:16–17; Mark 2:21–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>He also told them a parable: <span>“No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does, he will tear the new garment as well, and the patch from the new will not match the old.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">37</span>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined.
<span class="reftext">38</span>Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins.
<span class="reftext">39</span>And no one after drinking old wine wants new, for he says, ‘The old is better.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the Sea of Galilee<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Leprosy was a term used for various skin diseases.
