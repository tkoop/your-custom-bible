<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Queen of Sheba</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when the queen of Sheba heard about
the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to test
him with difficult questions. She arrived in Jerusalem with a very
large caravan—with camels bearing spices, gold in great abundance,
and precious stones. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So she came to Solomon and spoke to him
all that was on her mind. And Solomon answered all her questions;
nothing was too difficult for the king to explain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom
of Solomon, the palace he had built, the food at his table, the
seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and
cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of the
LORD, it took her breath away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">She said to the king, “The report I
heard in my own country about your words and wisdom is true. But I
did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes.
Indeed, not even half was told to me. Your wisdom and prosperity have
far exceeded the report I heard. How blessed are your men! How
blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you
and hear your wisdom! Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted
in you to set you on the throne of Israel. Because of the LORD’s
eternal love for Israel, He has made you king to carry out justice
and righteousness.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then she gave the king 120 talents of
gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again
was such an abundance of spices brought in as those the queen of
Sheba gave to King Solomon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">(The fleet of Hiram that brought gold from
Ophir also brought from Ophir a great cargo of almug wood and
precious stones. The king made the almug wood into steps for the
house of the LORD and for the king’s palace, and into lyres and
harps for the singers. Never before had such almug wood been brought
in, nor has such been seen to this day.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all
she desired—whatever she asked—besides what he had given her out
of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned to her own country,
along with her servants. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The weight of gold that came to Solomon
each year was 666 talents, not including the revenue from the
merchants, traders, and all the Arabian kings and governors of the
land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">King Solomon made two hundred large
shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each
shield. He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold;
three minas of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in
the House of the Forest of Lebanon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Additionally, the king made a great throne
of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. The throne had six steps,
and its back had a rounded top. There were armrests on both sides of
the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest. Twelve lions
stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like
this had ever been made for any kingdom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">All King Solomon’s drinking cups were
gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were
pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing
in the days of Solomon. For the king had the ships of Tarshish at sea
with Hiram’s fleet, and once every three years the ships of
Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and
peacocks. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of
the earth in riches and wisdom. The whole world sought an audience
with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart. Year
after year, each visitor would bring his tribute: articles of silver
and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon accumulated 1,400 chariots and
12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with
him in Jerusalem. The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as
stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon’s horses were imported from
Egypt and Kue; the royal merchants purchased them from Kue. A chariot
could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a
horse for a hundred and fifty. Likewise, they exported them to all
the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram. </font>
