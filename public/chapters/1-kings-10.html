<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Queen of Sheba<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 9:1–12)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon concerning the name of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, she came to test him with difficult questions.
<span class="reftext">2</span>She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan—with camels bearing spices, gold in great abundance, and precious stones. </p><p class="reg1"> So she came to Solomon and spoke to him all that was on her mind.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for the king to explain.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built,
<span class="reftext">5</span>the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, it took her breath away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and wisdom is true.
<span class="reftext">7</span>But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told to me. Your wisdom and prosperity have far exceeded the report I heard.
<span class="reftext">8</span>How blessed are your men!<span class="fn">a</span>  How blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!
<span class="reftext">9</span>Blessed be <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, who has delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel. Because of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s eternal love for Israel, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has made you king to carry out justice and righteousness.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold,<span class="fn">b</span>  a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never again was such an abundance of spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>(The fleet of Hiram that brought gold from Ophir also brought from Ophir a great cargo of almug<span class="fn">c</span>  wood and precious stones.
<span class="reftext">12</span>The king made the almug wood into steps for the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and for the king’s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers. Never before had such almug wood been brought in, nor has such been seen to this day.)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired—whatever she asked—besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned to her own country, along with her servants.

<span class="reftext">15</span>not including the revenue from the merchants, traders, and all the Arabian kings and governors of the land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of gold<span class="fn">e</span>  went into each shield.
<span class="reftext">17</span>He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three minas of gold<span class="fn">f</span>  went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the <span class='cap'>Forest</span><span class='nocap'>forest</span> of Lebanon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
<span class="reftext">19</span>The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>All King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the <span class='cap'>Forest</span><span class='nocap'>forest</span> of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.
<span class="reftext">22</span>For the king had the ships of Tarshish<span class="fn">g</span>  at sea with Hiram’s fleet, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.<span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
<span class="reftext">24</span>The whole world sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Year after year, each visitor would bring his tribute: articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Solomon accumulated<span class="fn">i</span>  1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses,<span class="fn">j</span>  which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">27</span>The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills.<span class="fn">k</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue;<span class="fn">l</span>  the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.
