<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the third year of the reign of Hoshea
son of Elah over Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abi, the
daughter of Zechariah. And he did what was right in the eyes of the
LORD, just as his father David had done. He removed the high places,
shattered the sacred pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles. He also
demolished the bronze snake called Nehushtan that Moses had made, for
up to that time the Israelites had burned incense to it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of
Israel. No king of Judah was like him, either before him or after
him. He remained faithful to the LORD and did not turn from following
Him; he kept the commandments that the LORD had given Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD was with Hezekiah, and he
prospered wherever he went. He rebelled against the king of Assyria
and refused to serve him. He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza
and its borders, from watchtower to fortified city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the fourth year of Hezekiah’s reign,
which was the seventh year of the reign of Hoshea son of Elah over
Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and
besieged it. And at the end of three years, the Assyrians captured
it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Samaria was captured in the sixth year
of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel. The
king of Assyria exiled the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in
Halah, in Gozan by the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes.
This happened because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD
their God, but violated His covenant—all that Moses the servant of
the LORD had commanded—and would neither listen nor obey. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah’s
reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked and captured all the
fortified cities of Judah. So Hezekiah king of Judah sent word to the
king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong; withdraw
from me, and I will pay whatever you demand from me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the king of Assyria exacted from
Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty
talents of gold. Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in
the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold
with which he had plated the doors and doorposts of the temple of the
LORD, and he gave it to the king of Assyria. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nevertheless, the king of Assyria sent the
Tartan, the Rabsaris, and the Rabshakeh, along with a great army,
from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They advanced up to
Jerusalem and stationed themselves by the aqueduct of the upper pool,
on the road to the Launderer’s Field. Then they called for the
king; and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebnah
the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, went out to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Rabshakeh said to them, “Tell
Hezekiah that this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says:
What is the basis of this confidence of yours? You claim to have a
strategy and strength for war, but these are empty words. In whom are
you now trusting, that you have rebelled against me? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Look now, you are trusting in Egypt, that
splintered reed of a staff that will pierce the hand of anyone who
leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is He not
the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to
Judah and Jerusalem: ‘You must worship before this altar in
Jerusalem’? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now, therefore, make a bargain with my
master, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses—if
you can put riders on them! For how can you repel a single officer
among the least of my master’s servants when you depend on Egypt
for chariots and horsemen? So now, was it apart from the LORD that I
have come up against this place to destroy it? The LORD Himself said
to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, along with
Shebnah and Joah, said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your
servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Do not speak with us in
Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the Rabshakeh replied, “Has my
master sent me to speak these words only to you and your master, and
not to the men sitting on the wall, who are destined with you to eat
their own dung and drink their own urine?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out
loudly in Hebrew: “Hear the word of the great king, the king of
Assyria! This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you;
he cannot deliver you from my hand. Do not let Hezekiah persuade you
to trust in the LORD when he says, ‘The LORD will surely deliver
us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of
Assyria.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is
what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me.
Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig
tree, and drink water from his own cistern, until I come and take you
away to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land
of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey—so that you
may live and not die. But do not listen to Hezekiah, for he misleads
you when he says, ‘The LORD will deliver us.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Has the god of any nation ever delivered
his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of
Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?
Have they delivered Samaria from my hand? Who among all the gods of
these lands has delivered his land from my hand? How then can the
LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the people remained silent and did not
answer a word, for Hezekiah had commanded, “Do not answer him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Hilkiah’s son Eliakim the palace
administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Asaph’s son Joah the recorder
came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they relayed to him the
words of the Rabshakeh. </font>
