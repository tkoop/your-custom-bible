<span class="reftext">2</span>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abi,<span class="fn">a</span>  the daughter of Zechariah.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he did what was right in the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, just as his father David had done.
<span class="reftext">4</span>He removed the high places, shattered the sacred pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles. He also demolished the bronze snake called Nehushtan<span class="fn">b</span>  that Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had burned incense to it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Hezekiah trusted in <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel. No king of Judah was like him, either before him or after him.
<span class="reftext">6</span>He remained faithful to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and did not turn from following <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>; he kept the commandments that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had given Moses.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was with Hezekiah, and he prospered wherever he went. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and refused to serve him.
<span class="reftext">8</span>He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its borders, from watchtower to fortified city.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>In the fourth year of Hezekiah’s reign, which was the seventh year of the reign of Hoshea son of Elah over Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and besieged it.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And at the end of three years, the Assyrians captured it. </p><p class="reg1"> So Samaria was captured in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel.
<span class="reftext">11</span>The king of Assyria exiled the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Gozan by the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes.
<span class="reftext">12</span>This happened because they did not listen to the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> their God, but violated <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> covenant—all that Moses the servant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded—and would neither listen nor obey.
</p><p class="hdg">Sennacherib Invades Judah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 32:1–8; Psalm 46:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked and captured all the fortified cities of Judah.
<span class="reftext">14</span>So Hezekiah king of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying, “I have done wrong; withdraw from me, and I will pay whatever you demand from me.” </p><p class="reg1"> And the king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver<span class="fn">c</span>  and thirty talents of gold.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and in the treasuries of the royal palace.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold with which he had plated the doors and doorposts of the temple of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and he gave it to the king of Assyria.
</p><p class="hdg">Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 32:9–19; Isaiah 36:1–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Nevertheless, the king of Assyria sent the Tartan,<span class="fn">e</span>  the Rabsaris,<span class="fn">f</span>  and the Rabshakeh,<span class="fn">g</span>  along with a great army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They advanced up to Jerusalem and stationed themselves by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the road to the <span class='cap'>Launderer</span><span class='nocap'>launderer</span>’s <span class='cap'>Field</span><span class='nocap'>field</span>.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Then they called for the king; and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebnah the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder, went out to them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>The Rabshakeh said to them, “Tell Hezekiah that this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is the basis of this confidence of yours?
<span class="reftext">20</span>You claim to have a strategy and strength for war, but these are empty words. In whom are you now trusting, that you have rebelled against me?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Look now, you are trusting in Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff that will pierce the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> say to me, ‘We trust in <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God,’ is <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> not the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem: ‘<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> must worship before this altar in Jerusalem’?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Now, therefore, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them!
<span class="reftext">24</span>For how can you repel a single officer among the least of my master’s servants when you depend on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
<span class="reftext">25</span>So now, was it apart from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> that I have come up against this place to destroy it? <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, along with Shebnah and Joah, said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Do not speak with us in Hebrew<span class="fn">h</span>  in the hearing of the people on the wall.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>But the Rabshakeh replied, “Has my master sent me to speak these words only to you and your master, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are destined with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out loudly in Hebrew: “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!
<span class="reftext">29</span>This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>; he cannot deliver <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from my hand.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> when he says, ‘<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me<span class="fn">i</span>  and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cistern,
<span class="reftext">32</span>until I come and take you away to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey—so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may live and not die. But do not listen to Hezekiah, for he misleads you when he says, ‘<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will deliver us.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
<span class="reftext">34</span>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
<span class="reftext">35</span>Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand? How then can <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>But the people remained silent and did not answer a word, for Hezekiah had commanded, “Do not answer him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>Then Hilkiah’s son Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Asaph’s son Joah the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they relayed to him the words of the Rabshakeh.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Abi</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Abijah</i>; see 2 Chronicles 29:1.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Nehushtan</i> sounds like the Hebrew for <i class="calibre6">bronze</i> and also for <i class="calibre6">snake</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">300 talents</i> is approximately 11.3 tons or 10.3 metric tons of silver.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">30 talents</i> is approximately 1.13 tons or 1.03 metric tons of gold.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Tartan</i> is the title of a field marshal, general, or commander in the Assyrian military.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Rabsaris</i> is the title of the chief eunuch in the Assyrian military.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Rabshakeh</i> is the title of a high-ranking Assyrian military officer; here and throughout chapters 18 and 19, as well as Isaiah 36 and 37.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the dialect of Judah</i>; also in verse 28<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Make a blessing with me</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
