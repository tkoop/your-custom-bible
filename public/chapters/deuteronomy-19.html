<font ><b>Cities of Refuge</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the LORD your God has cut off the
nations whose land He is giving you, and when you have driven them
out and settled in their cities and houses, then you are to set apart
for yourselves three cities within the land that the LORD your God is
giving you to possess. You are to build roads for yourselves and
divide into three regions the land that the LORD your God is giving
you as an inheritance, so that any manslayer can flee to these
cities. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now this is the situation regarding the
manslayer who flees to one of these cities to save his life, having
killed his neighbor accidentally, without intending to harm him: If
he goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut timber and swings
his axe to chop down a tree, but the blade flies off the handle and
strikes and kills his neighbor, he may flee to one of these cities to
save his life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Otherwise, the avenger of blood might
pursue the manslayer in a rage, overtake him if the distance is
great, and strike him dead though he did not deserve to die, since he
did not intend any harm. This is why I am commanding you to set apart
for yourselves three cities. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And if the LORD your God enlarges your
territory, as He swore to your fathers, and gives you all the land He
promised them, and if you carefully keep all these commandments I am
giving you today, loving the LORD your God and walking in His ways at
all times, then you are to add three more cities to these three. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus innocent blood will not be shed in
the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, so
that you will not be guilty of bloodshed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If, however, a man hates his neighbor and
lies in wait, attacks him and kills him, and then flees to one of
these cities, the elders of his city must send for him, bring him
back, and hand him over to the avenger of blood to die. You must show
him no pity. You are to purge from Israel the guilt of shedding
innocent blood, that it may go well with you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You must not move your neighborâ€™s
boundary marker, which was set up by your ancestors to mark the
inheritance you shall receive in the land that the LORD your God is
giving you to possess. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A lone witness is not sufficient to
establish any wrongdoing or sin against a man, regardless of what
offense he may have committed. A matter must be established by the
testimony of two or three witnesses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If a false witness testifies against
someone, accusing him of a crime, both parties to the dispute must
stand in the presence of the LORD, before the priests and judges who
are in office at that time. The judges shall investigate thoroughly,
and if the witness is proven to be a liar who has falsely accused his
brother, you must do to him as he intended to do to his brother. So
you must purge the evil from among you. Then the rest of the people
will hear and be afraid, and they will never again do anything so
evil among you. You must show no pity: life for life, eye for eye,
tooth for tooth, hand for hand, and foot for foot. </font>
