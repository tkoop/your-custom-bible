<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Cities of Refuge<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 35:9–34; Deuteronomy 4:41–43; Joshua 20:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has cut off the nations whose land <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is giving you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their cities and houses,
<span class="reftext">2</span>then you are to set apart for yourselves three cities within the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is giving you to possess.
<span class="reftext">3</span>You are to build roads for yourselves<span class="fn">a</span>  and divide into three regions the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that any manslayer can flee to these cities.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now this is the situation regarding the manslayer who flees to one of these cities to save his life, having killed his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> accidentally, without intending to harm him:
<span class="reftext">5</span>If he goes into the forest with his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> to cut timber and swings his axe to chop down a tree, but the blade flies off the handle and strikes and kills his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>, he may flee to one of these cities to save his life.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue the manslayer in a rage, overtake him if the distance is great, and strike him dead though he did not deserve to die, since he did not intend any harm.
<span class="reftext">7</span>This is why I am commanding you to set apart for yourselves three cities.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And if <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God enlarges your territory, as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> swore to your fathers, and gives you all the land <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> promised them,
<span class="reftext">9</span>and if you carefully keep all these commandments I am giving you today, loving <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God and walking in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> ways at all times, then you are to add three more cities to these three.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Thus innocent blood will not be shed in the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>If, however, a man hates his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> and lies in wait, attacks him and kills him, and then flees to one of these cities,
<span class="reftext">12</span>the elders of his city must send for him, bring him back, and hand him over to the avenger of blood to die.
<span class="reftext">13</span>You must show him no pity. You are to purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, that it may go well with you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>You must not move your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>’s boundary marker, which was set up by <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> ancestors to mark the inheritance you shall receive in the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is giving you to possess.
</p><p class="hdg">The Testimony of Two or Three Witnesses<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 18:15–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>A lone witness is not sufficient to establish any wrongdoing or sin against a man, regardless of what <span class='spell ca'>offence</span><span class='spell gb'>offence</span><span class='spell us'>offense</span> he may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>If a false witness testifies against someone, accusing him of a crime,
<span class="reftext">17</span>both parties to the dispute must stand in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, before the priests and judges who are in office at that time.
<span class="reftext">18</span>The judges shall investigate thoroughly, and if the witness is proven to be a liar who has falsely accused his brother,
<span class="reftext">19</span><span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must do to him as he intended to do to his brother. So you must purge the evil from among you.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Then the rest of the people will hear and be afraid, and they will never again do anything so evil among you.
<span class="reftext">21</span>You must show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth,<span class="fn">d</span>  hand for hand, and foot for foot.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">You are to survey the way</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Cited in Matthew 18:16 and 2 Corinthians 13:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Cited in 1 Corinthians 5:13<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Cited in Matthew 5:38<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
