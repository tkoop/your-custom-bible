<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Song of Moses<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Revelation 15:1–4)</span></p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak; </p><p class="indent"> hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Let my teaching fall like rain </p><p class="indent"> and my speech settle like dew, </p><p class="indent1"> like gentle rain on new grass, </p><p class="indent"> like showers on tender plants.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For I will proclaim the name of the LORD. </p><p class="indent"> Ascribe greatness to our God!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>He is the Rock, His work is perfect; </p><p class="indent"> all His ways are just. </p><p class="indent1"> A God of faithfulness without injustice, </p><p class="indent"> righteous and upright is He.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>His people have acted corruptly toward Him; </p><p class="indent"> the spot on them is not that of His children, </p><p class="indent"> but of a perverse and crooked generation.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Is this how you repay the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> O foolish and senseless people? </p><p class="indent1"> Is He not your Father and Creator? </p><p class="indent"> Has He not made you and established you?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Remember the days of old; </p><p class="indent"> consider the years long past. </p><p class="indent1"> Ask your father, and he will tell you, </p><p class="indent"> your elders, and they will inform you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, </p><p class="indent"> when He divided the sons of man, </p><p class="indent1"> He set the boundaries of the peoples </p><p class="indent"> according to the number of the sons of God.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>But the LORD’s portion is His people, </p><p class="indent"> Jacob His allotted inheritance.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>He found him in a desert land, </p><p class="indent"> in a barren, howling wilderness; </p><p class="indent1"> He surrounded him, He instructed him, </p><p class="indent"> He guarded him as the apple<span class="fn">c</span>  of His eye.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>As an eagle stirs up its nest </p><p class="indent"> and hovers over its young, </p><p class="indent1"> He spread His wings to catch them </p><p class="indent"> and carried them on His pinions.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>The LORD alone led him, </p><p class="indent"> and no foreign god was with him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>He made him ride on the heights of the land </p><p class="indent"> and fed him the produce of the field. </p><p class="indent1"> He nourished him with honey from the rock </p><p class="indent"> and oil from the flinty crag,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>with curds from the herd and milk from the flock, </p><p class="indent"> with the fat of lambs, </p><p class="indent1"> with rams from Bashan, and goats, </p><p class="indent"> with the choicest grains of wheat. </p><p class="indent1"> From the juice of the finest grapes </p><p class="indent"> you drank the wine.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>But Jeshurun<span class="fn">e</span>  grew fat and kicked—</p><p class="indent"> becoming fat, bloated, and gorged. </p><p class="indent1"> He abandoned the God who made him </p><p class="indent"> and scorned the Rock of his salvation.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>They provoked His jealousy with foreign gods; </p><p class="indent"> they enraged Him with abominations.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>They sacrificed to demons, not to God, </p><p class="indent"> to gods they had not known, </p><p class="indent1"> to newly arrived gods, </p><p class="indent"> which your fathers did not fear.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>You ignored the Rock who brought you forth; </p><p class="indent"> you forgot the God who gave you birth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>When the LORD saw this, He rejected them, </p><p class="indent"> provoked to anger by His sons and daughters.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>He said: “I will hide My face from them; </p><p class="indent"> I will see what will be their end. </p><p class="indent1"> For they are a perverse generation—</p><p class="indent"> children of unfaithfulness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>They have provoked My jealousy by that which is not God; </p><p class="indent"> they have enraged Me with their worthless idols. </p><p class="indent1"> So I will make them jealous by those who are not a people;<span class="fn">f</span>  </p><p class="indent"> I will make them angry by a nation without understanding.<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>For a fire has been kindled by My anger, </p><p class="indent"> and it burns to the depths of Sheol; </p><p class="indent1"> it consumes the earth and its produce, </p><p class="indent"> and scorches the foundations of the mountains.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>I will heap disasters upon them; </p><p class="indent"> I will spend My arrows against them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>They will be wasted from hunger </p><p class="indent"> and ravaged by pestilence and bitter plague; </p><p class="indent1"> I will send the fangs of wild beasts against them, </p><p class="indent"> with the venom of vipers that slither in the dust.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Outside, the sword will take their children, </p><p class="indent"> and inside, terror will strike </p><p class="indent1"> the young man and the young woman, </p><p class="indent"> the infant and the <span class='spell ca'>grey</span><span class='spell gb'>grey</span><span class='spell us'>gray</span>-haired man.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>I would have said that I would cut them to pieces </p><p class="indent"> and blot out their memory from mankind,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>if I had not dreaded the taunt of the enemy, </p><p class="indent"> lest their adversaries misunderstand and say: </p><p class="indent1">‘Our own hand has prevailed; </p><p class="indent"> it was not the LORD who did all this.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">28</span>Israel is a nation devoid of counsel, </p><p class="indent"> with no understanding among them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>If only they were wise, they would understand it; </p><p class="indent"> they would comprehend their fate.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>How could one man pursue a thousand, </p><p class="indent"> or two put ten thousand to flight, </p><p class="indent1"> unless their Rock had sold them, </p><p class="indent"> unless the LORD had given them up?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>For their rock is not like our Rock, </p><p class="indent"> even our enemies concede.<span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>But their vine is from the vine of Sodom </p><p class="indent"> and from the fields of Gomorrah. </p><p class="indent1"> Their grapes are poisonous; </p><p class="indent"> their clusters are bitter.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Their wine is the venom of serpents, </p><p class="indent"> the deadly poison of cobras.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">34</span>“Have I not stored up these things, </p><p class="indent"> sealed up within My vaults?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Vengeance is Mine; I will repay.<span class="fn">i</span>  </p><p class="indent"> In due time their foot will slip; </p><p class="indent1"> for their day of disaster is near, </p><p class="indent"> and their doom is coming quickly.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">36</span>For the LORD will vindicate His people<span class="fn">j</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and have compassion on His servants </p><p class="indent1"> when He sees that their strength is gone </p><p class="indent"> and no one remains, slave or free.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">37</span>He will say: “Where are their gods, </p><p class="indent"> the rock in which they took refuge,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">38</span>which ate the fat of their sacrifices </p><p class="indent"> and drank the wine of their drink offerings? </p><p class="indent1"> Let them rise up and help you; </p><p class="indent"> let them give you shelter!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">39</span>See now that I am He; </p><p class="indent"> there is no God besides Me. </p><p class="indent1"> I bring death and I give life; </p><p class="indent"> I wound and I heal, </p><p class="indent1"> and there is no one </p><p class="indent"> who can deliver from My hand.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">40</span>For I lift up My hand to heaven and declare: </p><p class="indent"> As surely as I live forever,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">41</span>when I sharpen My flashing sword, </p><p class="indent"> and My hand grasps it in <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span>, </p><p class="indent1"> I will take vengeance on My adversaries </p><p class="indent"> and repay those who hate Me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">42</span>I will make My arrows drunk with blood, </p><p class="indent"> while My sword devours flesh—</p><p class="indent1"> the blood of the slain and captives, </p><p class="indent"> the heads of the enemy leaders.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">43</span>Rejoice, O heavens, with Him, </p><p class="indent">and let all God’s angels worship Him.<span class="fn">k</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> Rejoice, O nations, with His people;<span class="fn">l</span>  </p><p class="indent"> for He will avenge the blood of His children.<span class="fn">m</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> He will take vengeance on His adversaries</p><p class="indent"> and repay those who hate Him;<span class="fn">n</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> He will cleanse His land </p><p class="indent"> and His people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>Then Moses came with Joshua<span class="fn">o</span>  son of Nun and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.
<span class="reftext">45</span>When Moses had finished reciting all these words to all Israel,
<span class="reftext">46</span>he said to them, “Take to heart all these words I testify among you today, so that you may command your children to carefully follow all the words of this law.
<span class="reftext">47</span>For they are not idle words to you, because they are your life, and by them you will live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”
</p><p class="hdg">Moses’ Death Foretold</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>On that same day the LORD said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">49</span>“Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo, in the land of Moab across from Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites as their own possession.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>And there on the mountain that you climb, you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">51</span>For at the waters of Meribah-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin, both of you broke faith with Me among the Israelites by failing to treat Me as holy in their presence.
<span class="reftext">52</span>Although you shall see from a distance the land that I am giving the Israelites, you shall not enter it.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in Philippians 2:15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> DSS; LXX <i class="calibre6">according to the number of the angels of God</i>; MT <i class="calibre6">according to the number of the sons of Israel</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the pupil</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Pinions</i> are the outer parts of a bird’s wings, including the flight feathers.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Jeshurun</i> means <i class="calibre6">the upright one</i>, a term of endearment for Israel.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">not a nation</i>; see also LXX.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Cited in Romans 10:19<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Hebrew; LXX <i class="calibre6">but our enemies are void of understanding</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Vengeance is Mine, and recompense</i>; cited in Romans 12:19 and Hebrews 10:30<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Or <i class="calibre6">will judge His people</i>; see also LXX; cited in Hebrews 10:30<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">43</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> See DSS and LXX; MT lacks <i class="calibre6">Rejoice, O heavens, with Him, and let all God’s angels worship Him.</i> Cited in Hebrews 1:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">43</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> Cited in Romans 15:10<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">43</span> <span class="footnotesbot">m</span> DSS and LXX; MT <i class="calibre6">servants</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">43</span> <span class="footnotesbot">n</span> LXX and Vulgate; MT lacks <i class="calibre6">and repay those who hate Him</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">44</span> <span class="footnotesbot">o</span> LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Hoshea</i>, a variant of <i class="calibre6">Joshua</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
