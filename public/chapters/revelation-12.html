<font >And a great sign appeared in heaven: a
woman clothed in the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of
twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and crying out in the pain
and agony of giving birth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then another sign appeared in heaven: a
huge red dragon with seven heads, ten horns, and seven royal crowns
on his heads. His tail swept a third of the stars from the sky,
tossing them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who
was about to give birth, ready to devour her child as soon as she
gave birth. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And she gave birth to a son, a male child,
who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was
caught up to God and to His throne. And the woman fled into the
wilderness, where God had prepared a place for her to be nourished
for 1,260 days. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then a war broke out in heaven: Michael
and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his
angels fought back. But the dragon was not strong enough, and no
longer was any place found in heaven for him and his angels. And the
great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil
and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was hurled to the
earth, and his angels with him. </font>

thrown to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the
male child. But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle to fly

where she was nourished for a time, and times, and half a time. </font>

rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to
the testimony of Jesus. </font>
