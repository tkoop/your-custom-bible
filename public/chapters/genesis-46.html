<font >So Israel set out with all that he had,
and when he came to Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of
his father Isaac. And that night God spoke to Israel in a vision:
“Jacob, Jacob!” He said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Here I am,” replied Jacob. </font>

“<font >I am God,” He said, “the God of
your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make
you into a great nation there. I will go down with you to Egypt, and
I will surely bring you back. And Joseph’s own hands will close
your eyes.” </font>

<font >Then Jacob departed from Beersheba, and
the sons of Israel took their father Jacob in the wagons Pharaoh had
sent to carry him, along with their children and wives. They also
took the livestock and possessions they had acquired in the land of
Canaan, and Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt. </font>
