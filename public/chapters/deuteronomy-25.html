<font face="Tahoma, serif">If there is a dispute between men, they
are to go to court to be judged, so that the innocent may be
acquitted and the guilty condemned. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">If the guilty man deserves to be beaten,
the judge shall have him lie down and be flogged in his presence with
the number of lashes his crime warrants. He may receive no more than
forty lashes, lest your brother be beaten any more than that and be
degraded in your sight. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When brothers dwell together and one of
them dies without a son, the widow must not marry outside the family.
Her husband’s brother is to take her as his wife and fulfill the
duty of a brother-in-law for her. The first son she bears will carry
on the name of the dead brother, so that his name will not be blotted
out from Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But if the man does not want to marry his
brother’s widow, she is to go to the elders at the city gate and
say, “My husband’s brother refuses to preserve his brother’s
name in Israel. He is not willing to perform the duty of a
brother-in-law for me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the elders of his city shall summon
him and speak with him. If he persists and says, “I do not want to
marry her,” his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the
presence of the elders, remove his sandal, spit in his face, and
declare, “This is what is done to the man who will not maintain his
brother’s line.” And his family name in Israel will be called
“The House of the Unsandaled.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If two men are fighting, and the wife of
one steps in to rescue her husband from the one striking him, and she
reaches out her hand and grabs his genitals, you are to cut off her
hand. You must show her no pity. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">You must maintain accurate and honest
weights and measures, so that you may live long in the land that the
LORD your God is giving you. For everyone who behaves dishonestly in
regard to these things is detestable to the LORD your God. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Remember what the Amalekites did to you
along your way from Egypt, how they met you on your journey when you
were tired and weary, and they attacked all your stragglers; they had
no fear of God. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the LORD your God gives you rest from
the enemies around you in the land that He is giving you to possess
as an inheritance, you are to blot out the memory of Amalek from
under heaven. Do not forget! </font>
