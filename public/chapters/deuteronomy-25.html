the judge shall have him lie down and be flogged in his presence with
the number of lashes his crime warrants. He may receive no more than
forty lashes, lest your brother be beaten any more than that and be
degraded in your sight. </font>

<font >When brothers dwell together and one of
them dies without a son, the widow must not marry outside the family.
Her husband’s brother is to take her as his wife and fulfill the
duty of a brother-in-law for her. The first son she bears will carry
on the name of the dead brother, so that his name will not be blotted
out from Israel. </font>

brother’s widow, she is to go to the elders at the city gate and
say, “My husband’s brother refuses to preserve his brother’s
name in Israel. He is not willing to perform the duty of a
brother-in-law for me.” </font>

him and speak with him. If he persists and says, “I do not want to
marry her,” his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the
presence of the elders, remove his sandal, spit in his face, and
declare, “This is what is done to the man who will not maintain his
brother’s line.” And his family name in Israel will be called
“The House of the Unsandaled.” </font>
