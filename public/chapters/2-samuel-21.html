<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">David Avenges the Gibeonites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>During the reign of David there was a famine for three successive years, and David sought the face of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. </p><p class="reg1"> And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, “It is because of the blood shed by Saul and his family, because he killed the Gibeonites.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>At this, David summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not Israelites, but a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had taken an oath concerning them, but in his zeal for Israel and Judah, Saul had sought to kill them.)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So David asked the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>? How can I make amends so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may bless the inheritance of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>The Gibeonites said to him, “We need no silver or gold from Saul or his house, nor should you put to death anyone in Israel for us.” </p><p class="reg1">“Whatever <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> ask, I will do for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And they answered the king, “As for the man who consumed us and plotted against us to exterminate us from existing within any border of Israel,
<span class="reftext">6</span>let seven of his male descendants be delivered to us so that we may hang them<span class="fn">a</span>  before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> at Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.” </p><p class="reg1">“I will give them to you,” said the king.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now the king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> between David and Jonathan son of Saul.
<span class="reftext">8</span>But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons whom Rizpah daughter of Aiah had borne to Saul, as well as the five sons whom Merab<span class="fn">b</span>  daughter of Saul had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. So all seven of them fell together; they were put to death in the first days of the harvest, at the beginning of the barley harvest.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest until the rain from <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> poured down on the bodies, she did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>When David was told what Saul’s concubine Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, had done,
<span class="reftext">12</span>he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan where the Philistines had hung the bodies after they had struck down Saul at Gilboa.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So David had the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan brought from there, along with the bones of those who had been hanged.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in Zela in the land of Benjamin, in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish. </p><p class="reg1"> After they had done everything the king had commanded, God answered their prayers for the land.
</p><p class="hdg">Four Battles against the Philistines<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 20:4–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Once again the Philistines waged war against Israel, and David and his servants went down and fought against the Philistines; but David became exhausted.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then Ishbi-benob, a descendant of Rapha,<span class="fn">c</span>  whose bronze spear weighed three hundred shekels<span class="fn">d</span>  and who was bearing a new sword, resolved to kill David.
<span class="reftext">17</span>But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to his aid, struck the Philistine, and killed him. </p><p class="reg1"> Then David’s men swore to him, “You must never again go out with us to battle, so that the lamp of Israel may not be extinguished.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Some time later at Gob, there was another battle with the Philistines. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph,<span class="fn">e</span>  one of the descendants of Rapha.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Once again there was a battle with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan son of Jair<span class="fn">f</span>  the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath<span class="fn">g</span>  the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And there was still another battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha,
<span class="reftext">21</span>and when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of David’s brother Shimei<span class="fn">h</span>  killed him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So these four descendants of Rapha in Gath fell at the hands of David and his servants.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">expose them</i> or <i class="calibre6">execute them</i>; similarly in verse 9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Two Hebrew manuscripts, some LXX manuscripts, and Syriac (see also 1 Samuel 18:19); most Hebrew and LXX manuscripts <i class="calibre6">Michal</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the giant</i>; also in verses 18, 20, and 22<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">300 shekels</i> is approximately 7.5 pounds or 3.4 kilograms.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Saph</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Sippai</i>; see 1 Chronicles 20:4.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> See 1 Chronicles 20:5; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Jaare-oregim</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> See 1 Chronicles 20:5; Hebrew does not include <i class="calibre6">the brother of</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">Shimei</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Shammah</i>, <i class="calibre6">Shimeah</i>, and <i class="calibre6">Shimea</i>; see 1 Samuel 16:9, 2 Samuel 13:3, and 1 Chronicles 2:13.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
