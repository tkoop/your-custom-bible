<font ><b>David Avenges the Gibeonites</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >During the reign of David there was a
famine for three successive years, and David sought the face of the
LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said, “It is because of the
blood shed by Saul and his family, because he killed the Gibeonites.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, David summoned the Gibeonites and
spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not Israelites, but a remnant
of the Amorites. The Israelites had taken an oath concerning them,
but in his zeal for Israel and Judah, Saul had sought to kill them.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David asked the Gibeonites, “What
shall I do for you? How can I make amends so that you may bless the
inheritance of the LORD?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Gibeonites said to him, “We need no
silver or gold from Saul or his house, nor should you put to death
anyone in Israel for us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Whatever you ask, I will do for you,”
he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And they answered the king, “As for the
man who consumed us and plotted against us to exterminate us from
existing within any border of Israel, let seven of his male
descendants be delivered to us so that we may hang them before the
LORD at Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I will give them to you,” said the
king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the king spared Mephibosheth son of
Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD
between David and Jonathan son of Saul. But the king took Armoni and
Mephibosheth, the two sons whom Rizpah daughter of Aiah had borne to
Saul, as well as the five sons whom Merab daughter of Saul had borne
to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite. And he delivered them
into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill
before the LORD. So all seven of them fell together; they were put to
death in the first days of the harvest, at the beginning of the
barley harvest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took
sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning
of the harvest until the rain from heaven poured down on the bodies,
she did not allow the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor
the beasts of the field by night. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When David was told what Saul’s
concubine Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, had done, he went and took the
bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who
had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan where the
Philistines had hung the bodies after they had struck down Saul at
Gilboa. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David had the bones of Saul and his son
Jonathan brought from there, along with the bones of those who had
been hanged. And they buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan
in Zela in the land of Benjamin, in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After they had done everything the king
had commanded, God answered their prayers for the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once again the Philistines waged war
against Israel, and David and his servants went down and fought
against the Philistines; but David became exhausted. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Ishbi-benob, a descendant of Rapha,
whose bronze spear weighed three hundred shekels and who was bearing
a new sword, resolved to kill David. But Abishai son of Zeruiah came
to his aid, struck the Philistine, and killed him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David’s men swore to him, “You
must never again go out with us to battle, so that the lamp of Israel
may not be extinguished.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some time later at Gob, there was another
battle with the Philistines. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite
killed Saph, one of the descendants of Rapha. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once again there was a battle with the
Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan son of Jair the Bethlehemite killed
the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like
a weaver’s beam. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And there was still another battle at
Gath, where there was a man of great stature with six fingers on each
hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was
descended from Rapha, and when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of
David’s brother Shimei killed him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So these four descendants of Rapha in Gath
fell at the hands of David and his servants. </font>
