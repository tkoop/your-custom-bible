<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Christ’s Perfect Sacrifice<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 40:1–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the realities themselves. It can never, by the same sacrifices offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.
<span class="reftext">2</span>If it could, would not the offerings have ceased? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt the guilt of their sins.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Instead, those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins,
<span class="reftext">4</span>because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Therefore, when Christ came into the world, He said: </p><p class="indent1stlinered">“Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, </p><p class="indentred"> but a body You prepared for Me.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">6</span>In burnt offerings and sin offerings </p><p class="indentred"> You took no delight.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then I said, ‘Here I am, it is written about Me in the scroll: </p><p class="indentred"> I have come to do Your will, O God.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>In the passage above He says, <span>“Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not desire, nor did You delight in them” </span> (although they are offered according to the law).
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then He adds, <span>“Here I am, I have come to do Your will.”</span> He takes away the first to establish the second.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And by that will, we have been sanctified through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Day after day every priest stands to minister and to offer again and again the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But when this Priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Since that time, He waits for His enemies to be made a footstool for His feet,
<span class="reftext">14</span>because by a single offering He has made perfect for all time those who are being sanctified.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First He says:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>“This is the covenant I will make with them </p><p class="indent"> after those days, declares the Lord. </p><p class="indent1"> I will put My laws in their hearts </p><p class="indent"> and inscribe them on their minds.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then He adds: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Their sins and lawless acts </p><p class="indent"> I will remember no more.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And where these have been forgiven, an offering for sin is no longer needed.
</p><p class="hdg">A Call to Persevere<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jude 1:17–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place<span class="fn">d</span>  by the blood of Jesus,
<span class="reftext">20</span>by the new and living way opened for us through the curtain of His body,<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
<span class="reftext">22</span>let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Let us hold resolutely to the hope we profess, for He who promised is faithful.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And let us consider how to spur one another on to love and good deeds.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Let us not neglect meeting together, as some have made a habit, but let us encourage one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>If we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins remains,
<span class="reftext">27</span>but only a fearful expectation of <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> and of raging fire that will consume all adversaries.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
<span class="reftext">29</span>How much more severely do you think one deserves to be punished who has trampled on the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and insulted the Spirit of grace?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>For we know Him who said, “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,”<span class="fn">f</span>  and again, “The Lord will judge His people.”<span class="fn">g</span> 
<span class="reftext">31</span>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Remember the early days that you were in the light.<span class="fn">h</span>  In those days, you endured a great conflict in the face of suffering.
<span class="reftext">33</span>Sometimes you were publicly exposed to ridicule and persecution; at other times you were partners with those who were so treated.
<span class="reftext">34</span>You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, knowing that you yourselves had a better and permanent possession.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>So do not throw away your confidence; it holds a great reward.
<span class="reftext">36</span>You need to persevere, so that after you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised.
<span class="reftext">37</span>For, </p><p class="indent1stline"> “In just a little while, </p><p class="indent"> He who is coming will come and will not delay.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">38</span>But My righteous one will live by faith;<span class="fn">i</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and if he shrinks back, </p><p class="indent"> I will take no pleasure in him.”<span class="fn">j</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Psalm 40:6–8 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Jeremiah 31:33<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Jeremiah 31:34<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Holy Place</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">through the veil that is His flesh</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Deuteronomy 32:35 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">32</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Remember when you were first enlightened.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">38</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">But the righteous will live by faith</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">38</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Habakkuk 2:3–4 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
