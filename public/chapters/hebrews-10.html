<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Christ’s Perfect Sacrifice<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 40:1–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the realities themselves. It can never, by the same sacrifices offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.
<span class="reftext">2</span>If it could, would not the offerings have ceased? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt the guilt of their sins.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Instead, those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins,
<span class="reftext">4</span>because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Therefore, when Christ came into the world, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said: </p><p class="indent1stlinered">“Sacrifice and offering <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> did not desire, </p><p class="indentred"> but a body <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> prepared for <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">6</span>In burnt offerings and sin offerings </p><p class="indentred"> You took no delight.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then I said, ‘Here I am, it is written about <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> in the scroll: </p><p class="indentred"> I have come to do <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> will, O God.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>In the passage above <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> says, <span>“Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> did not desire, nor did <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> delight in them” </span> (although they are offered according to the law).
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> adds, <span>“Here I am, I have come to do <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> will.”</span> He takes away the first to establish the second.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And by that will, we have been sanctified through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Day after day every priest stands to minister and to offer again and again the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But when this Priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> sat down at the right hand of God.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Since that time, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> waits for <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> enemies to be made a footstool for <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> feet,
<span class="reftext">14</span>because by a single offering <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has made perfect for all time those who are being sanctified.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> also testifies to us about this. First <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> says:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>“This is the covenant I will make with them </p><p class="indent"> after those days, declares the Lord. </p><p class="indent1"> I will put <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> laws in their hearts </p><p class="indent"> and inscribe them on their minds.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> adds: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Their sins and lawless acts </p><p class="indent"> I will remember no more.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And where these have been forgiven, an offering for sin is no longer needed.
</p><p class="hdg">A Call to Persevere<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jude 1:17–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span><span class='bsb'>Most</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span><span class='bsb'>Place</span><span class="fn">d</span>  by the blood of Jesus,

<span class="reftext">21</span>and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
<span class="reftext">22</span>let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Let us hold resolutely to the hope we profess, for <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> who promised is faithful.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And let us consider how to spur one another on to love and good deeds.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Let us not neglect meeting together, as some have made a habit, but let us encourage one another, and all the more as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> see the <span class='cap'>Day</span><span class='nocap'>day</span><span class='bsb'>Day</span> approaching.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>If we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins remains,
<span class="reftext">27</span>but only a fearful expectation of <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> and of raging fire that will consume all adversaries.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
<span class="reftext">29</span>How much more severely do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> think one deserves to be punished who has trampled on the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of God, profaned the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and insulted the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> of grace?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>For we know <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> who said, “Vengeance is <span class='cap'>Mine</span><span class='nocap'>mine</span><span class='bsb'>Mine</span>; I will repay,”<span class="fn">f</span>  and again, “The Lord will judge <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> people.”<span class="fn">g</span> 
<span class="reftext">31</span>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Remember the early days that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were in the light.<span class="fn">h</span>  In those days, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> endured a great conflict in the face of suffering.
<span class="reftext">33</span>Sometimes <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were publicly exposed to ridicule and persecution; at other times <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were partners with those who were so treated.
<span class="reftext">34</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> property, knowing that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> yourselves had a better and permanent possession.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>So do not throw away <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> confidence; it holds a great reward.
