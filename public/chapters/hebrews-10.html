<font >For the law is only a shadow of the good
things to come, not the realities themselves. It can never, by the
same sacrifices offered year after year, make perfect those who draw
near to worship. If it could, would not the offerings have ceased?
For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would
no longer have felt the guilt of their sins. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Instead, those sacrifices are an annual
reminder of sins, because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and
goats to take away sins. Therefore, when Christ came into the world,
He said: </font>

<font >In the passage above He says, <font color="#a80000">“Sacrifices
and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not desire,
nor did You delight in them” </font>(although they are offered
according to the law). Then He adds, <font color="#a80000">“Here I
am, I have come to do Your will.”</font> He takes away the first to
establish the second. And by that will, we have been sanctified
through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Day after day every priest stands to
minister and to offer again and again the same sacrifices, which can
never take away sins. But when this Priest had offered for all time
one sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God. Since
that time, He waits for His enemies to be made a footstool for His
feet, because by a single offering He has made perfect for all time
those who are being sanctified. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about
this. First He says: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >This is the covenant I will make with
them </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >after those days, declares the Lord. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will put My laws in their hearts </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and inscribe them on their minds.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He adds: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Their sins and lawless acts </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will remember no more.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And where these have been forgiven, an
offering for sin is no longer needed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, brothers, since we have
confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, by the
new and living way opened for us through the curtain of His body, and
since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near
with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts
sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and our bodies
washed with pure water. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Let us hold resolutely to the hope we
profess, for He who promised is faithful. And let us consider how to
spur one another on to love and good deeds. Let us not neglect
meeting together, as some have made a habit, but let us encourage one
another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If we deliberately go on sinning after we
have received the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for
sins remains, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of
raging fire that will consume all adversaries. Anyone who rejected
the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three
witnesses. How much more severely do you think one deserves to be
punished who has trampled on the Son of God, profaned the blood of
the covenant that sanctified him, and insulted the Spirit of grace? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For we know Him who said, “Vengeance is
Mine; I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge His people.”
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Remember the early days that you were in
the light. In those days, you endured a great conflict in the face of
suffering. Sometimes you were publicly exposed to ridicule and
persecution; at other times you were partners with those who were so
treated. You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted
the confiscation of your property, knowing that you yourselves had a
better and permanent possession. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So do not throw away your confidence; it
holds a great reward. You need to persevere, so that after you have
done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised. For, </font>
