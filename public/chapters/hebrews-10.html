<font >For the law is only a shadow of the good
things to come, not the realities themselves. It can never, by the
same sacrifices offered year after year, make perfect those who draw
near to worship. If it could, would not the offerings have ceased?
For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would
no longer have felt the guilt of their sins. </font>

<font >Day after day every priest stands to
minister and to offer again and again the same sacrifices, which can
never take away sins. But when this Priest had offered for all time
one sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God. Since
that time, He waits for His enemies to be made a footstool for His
feet, because by a single offering He has made perfect for all time
those who are being sanctified. </font>

<font >If we deliberately go on sinning after we
have received the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for
sins remains, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of
raging fire that will consume all adversaries. Anyone who rejected
the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three
witnesses. How much more severely do you think one deserves to be
punished who has trampled on the Son of God, profaned the blood of
the covenant that sanctified him, and insulted the Spirit of grace? </font>

persecution; at other times you were partners with those who were so

the confiscation of your property, knowing that you yourselves had a
better and permanent possession. </font>
