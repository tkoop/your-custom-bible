<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Paul and the False Apostles</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>I hope <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will bear with a little of my foolishness, but <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are already doing that.
<span class="reftext">2</span>I am jealous for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> with a godly jealousy. For I promised <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>I am afraid, however, that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> minds may be led astray from your simple and pure devotion to Christ.
<span class="reftext">4</span>For if someone comes and proclaims a Jesus other than the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> we proclaimed, or if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> receive a different spirit than the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> received, or a different gospel than the one <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> accepted, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> put up with it way too easily.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>I consider myself in no way inferior to those “super-apostles.”
<span class="reftext">6</span>Although I am not a polished speaker, I am certainly not lacking in knowledge. We have made this clear to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in every way possible.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Was it a sin for me to humble myself in order to exalt <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, because I preached the gospel of God to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> free of charge?
<span class="reftext">8</span>I robbed other churches by accepting their support in order to serve <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And when I was with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and in need, I was not a burden to anyone; for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my needs. I have refrained from being a burden to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in any way, and I will continue to do so.
<span class="reftext">10</span>As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Why? Because I do not love <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>? God knows I do!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But I will keep on doing what I am doing, in order to undercut those who want an opportunity to be regarded as our equals in the things of which they boast.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.
<span class="reftext">15</span>It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their actions.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Suffering and Service<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Colossians 1:24–29)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do, then receive me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.
<span class="reftext">17</span>In this confident boasting of mine, I am not speaking as the Lord would, but as a fool.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Since many are boasting according to the flesh, I too will boast.
<span class="reftext">19</span>For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> gladly tolerate fools, since <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are so wise.
<span class="reftext">20</span>In fact, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> even put up with anyone who enslaves <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> or exploits you or takes advantage of you or exalts himself or strikes <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in the face.
<span class="reftext">21</span>To my shame I concede that we were too weak for that! </p><p class="reg1"> Speaking as a fool, however, I can match what anyone else dares to boast about.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Are they servants of Christ? I am speaking like I am out of my mind, but I am so much more: in harder <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>, in more imprisonments, in worse beatings, in frequent danger of death.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked. I spent a night and a day in the open sea.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>In my frequent journeys, I have been in danger from rivers and from bandits, in danger from my countrymen and from the Gentiles, in danger in the city and in the country, in danger on the sea and among false brothers,
<span class="reftext">27</span>in <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> and toil and often without sleep, in hunger and thirst and often without food, in cold and exposure.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Apart from these external trials, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not burn with grief?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
<span class="reftext">31</span>The God and <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> of the Lord Jesus, who is forever worthy of praise,<span class="fn">a</span>  knows that I am not lying.
<span class="reftext">32</span>In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas secured the city of the Damascenes in order to arrest me.
<span class="reftext">33</span>But I was lowered in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his grasp.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">forever blessed</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
