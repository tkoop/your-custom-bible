<font ><b>The Collection for the Saints</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now about the collection for the saints,
you are to do as I directed the churches of Galatia: On the first day
of every week, each of you should set aside a portion of his income,
saving it up, so that when I come no collections will be needed.
Then, on my arrival, I will send letters with those you recommend to
carry your gift to Jerusalem. And if it is advisable for me to go
also, they can travel with me. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After I go through Macedonia, however, I
will come to you; for I will be going through Macedonia. Perhaps I
will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can
help me on my journey, wherever I go. For I do not want to see you
now only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord
permits. But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, because a great
door for effective work has opened to me, even though many oppose me.

<font >If Timothy comes, see to it that he has
nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is doing the work of the
Lord, just as I am. No one, then, should treat him with contempt.
Send him on his way in peace so that he can return to me, for I am
expecting him along with the brothers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly
urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was not at all inclined
to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity. </font>

<font >You know that Stephanas and his household
were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves
to the service of the saints. Now I urge you, brothers, to submit to
such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and
Achaicus have arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking
from you. For they refreshed my spirit and yours as well. Show your
appreciation, therefore, to such men. </font>
