<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Collection for the Saints<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Corinthians 9:1–15)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now about the collection for the saints, you are to do as I directed the churches of Galatia:
<span class="reftext">2</span>On the first day of every week, each of you should set aside a portion of his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will be needed.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then, on my arrival, I will send letters with those you recommend to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And if it is advisable for me to go also, they can travel with me.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Travel Plans<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Romans 15:23–33)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>After I go through Macedonia, however, I will come to you; for I will be going through Macedonia.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For I do not want to see you now only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.
<span class="reftext">8</span>But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">9</span>because a great door for effective work has opened to me, even though many oppose me.
</p><p class="hdg">Timothy and Apollos<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Philippians 2:19–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am.
<span class="reftext">11</span>No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he can return to me, for I am expecting him along with the brothers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was not at all inclined to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.
</p><p class="hdg">Concluding Exhortations</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Be on the alert. Stand firm in the faith. Be men of courage. Be strong.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Do everything in love.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>You know that Stephanas and his household were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. Now I urge you, brothers,
<span class="reftext">16</span>to submit to such as these, and to every fellow worker and labourer.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For they refreshed my spirit and yours as well. Show your appreciation, therefore, to such men.
