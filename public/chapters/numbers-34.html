<span class="reftext">12</span>Then the border will go down along the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea. </p><p class="reg1"> This will be your land, defined by its borders on all sides.”

<span class="reftext">14</span>For the tribes of the Reubenites and Gadites, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh, have already received their inheritance.
<span class="reftext">15</span>These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan from Jericho, toward the sunrise.”
