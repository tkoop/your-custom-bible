<font ><b>The Return of the Son of Man</b></font></p>

<font >As Jesus left the temple and was walking
away, His disciples came up to Him to point out its buildings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Do you see all
these things?”</font> He replied. <font color="#a80000">“Truly I
tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will
be thrown down.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of
Olives, the disciples came to Him privately. “Tell us,” they
said, “when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of
Your coming and of the end of the age?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“See
to it that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name,
claiming, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many. You will hear
of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed.
These things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will
rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be
famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the
beginning of birth pains.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Then they will
deliver you over to be persecuted and killed, and you will be hated
by all nations because of My name. At that time many will fall away
and will betray and hate one another, and many false prophets will
arise and mislead many. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Because of the
multiplication of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold. But
the one who perseveres to the end will be saved. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >And this gospel of
the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a testimony to all
nations, and then the end will come. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >So when you see
standing in the holy place ‘the abomination of desolation,’
described by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand), then let
those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let no one on the
housetop come down to retrieve anything from his house. And let no
one in the field return for his cloak. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >How miserable those
days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! Pray that your flight
will not occur in the winter or on the Sabbath. For at that time
there will be great tribulation, unmatched from the beginning of the
world until now, and never to be seen again. If those days had not
been cut short, nobody would be saved. But for the sake of the elect,
those days will be cut short. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >At that time, if
anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There He
is!’ do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will
appear and perform great signs and wonders that would deceive even
the elect, if that were possible. See, I have told you in advance. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >So if they tell you,
‘There He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here He is
in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. For just as the lightning
comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the
coming of the Son of Man. Wherever there is a carcass, there the
vultures will gather. </font></font>

not give its light; </font></font>

the heavens will be shaken.’ </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >At that time the
sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of
the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the
clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And He will send out
His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect
from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Now learn this
lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its branches become tender and
sprout leaves, you know that summer is near. So also, when you see
all these things, you will know that He is near, right at the door.
Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these
things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words
will never pass away. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >No one knows about
that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but
only the Father. As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the
coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people
were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the
day Noah entered the ark. And they were oblivious, until the flood
came and swept them all away. So will it be at the coming of the Son
of Man. Two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other
left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and
the other left. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Therefore keep
watch, because you do not know the day on which your Lord will come.
But understand this: If the homeowner had known in which watch of the
night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not
have let his house be broken into. For this reason, you also must be
ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour you do not expect.

faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of his
household, to give the others their food at the proper time? Blessed
is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.
Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But suppose that
servant is wicked and says in his heart, ‘My master will be away a
long time.’ And he begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat
and drink with drunkards. The master of that servant will come on a
day he does not expect and at an hour he does not anticipate. Then he
will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites,
where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </font></font>
