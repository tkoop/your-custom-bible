<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">About that time, King Herod reached out to
harm some who belonged to the church. He had James, the brother of
John, put to death with the sword. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And seeing that this pleased the Jews,
Herod proceeded to seize Peter during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
He arrested him and put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded
by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out
to the people after the Passover. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Peter was kept in prison, but the
church was fervently praying to God for him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the night before Herod was to bring him
to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two
chains, with sentries standing guard at the entrance to the prison.
Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell.
He tapped Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, “Get up
quickly.” And the chains fell off his wrists. “Get dressed and
put on your sandals,” said the angel. Peter did so, and the angel
told him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Peter followed him out, but he was
unaware that what the angel was doing was real. He thought he was
only seeing a vision. They passed the first and second guards and
came to the iron gate leading to the city, which opened for them by
itself. When they had gone outside and walked the length of one
block, the angel suddenly left him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now
I know for sure that the Lord has sent His angel and rescued me from
Herod’s grasp and from everything the Jewish people were
anticipating.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when he had realized this, he went to
the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many
people had gathered together and were praying. He knocked at the
outer gate, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer it. When
she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed that she forgot
to open the gate, but ran inside and announced, “Peter is standing
at the gate!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You are out of your mind,” they told
her. But when she kept insisting it was so, they said, “It must be
his angel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Peter kept on knocking, and when they
opened the door and saw him, they were astounded. Peter motioned with
his hand for silence, and he described how the Lord had brought him
out of the prison. “Send word to James and to the brothers,” he
said, and he left for another place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At daybreak there was no small commotion
among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. After Herod had
searched for him unsuccessfully, he examined the guards and ordered
that they be executed. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and
spent some time there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Herod was in a furious dispute with
the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they convened before him. Having
secured the support of Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, they asked
for peace, because their region depended on the king’s country for
food. On the appointed day, Herod donned his royal robes, sat on his
throne, and addressed the people. And they began to shout, “This is
the voice of a god, not a man!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Immediately, because Herod did not give
glory to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten
by worms and died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the word of God continued to spread
and multiply. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Barnabas and Saul had fulfilled their
mission to Jerusalem, they returned, bringing with them John, also
called Mark. </font>
