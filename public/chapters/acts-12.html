<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">James Killed, Peter Imprisoned</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>About that time, King Herod<span class="fn">a</span>  reached out to harm<span class="fn">b</span>  some who belonged to the church.
<span class="reftext">2</span>He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And seeing that this pleased the Jews, Herod proceeded to seize Peter during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>He arrested him and put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out to the people after the Passover.
</p><p class="hdg">The Rescue of Peter</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was fervently praying to God for him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>On the night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, with sentries standing guard at the entrance to the prison.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, “Get up quickly.” And the chains fell off his wrists.
<span class="reftext">8</span>“Get dressed and put on your sandals,” said the angel. Peter did so, and the angel told him, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So Peter followed him out, but he was unaware that what the angel was doing was real. He thought he was only seeing a vision.
<span class="reftext">10</span>They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city, which opened for them by itself. When they had gone outside and walked the length of one block, the angel suddenly left him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent His angel and rescued me from Herod’s grasp and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And when he had realized this, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered together and were praying.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He knocked at the outer gate, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer it.
<span class="reftext">14</span>When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed that she forgot to open the gate, but ran inside and announced, “Peter is standing at the gate!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>“You are out of your mind,” they told her. But when she kept insisting it was so, they said, “It must be his angel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astounded.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Peter motioned with his hand for silence, and he described how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. “Send word to James and to the brothers,” he said, and he left for another place.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>At daybreak there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.
<span class="reftext">19</span>After Herod had searched for him unsuccessfully, he examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent some time there.
</p><p class="hdg">The Death of Herod</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now Herod was in a furious dispute<span class="fn">d</span>  with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they convened before him. Having secured the support of Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their region depended on the king’s country for food.
<span class="reftext">21</span>On the appointed day, Herod donned his royal robes, sat on his throne, and addressed the people.
<span class="reftext">22</span>And they began to shout, “This is the voice of a god, not a man!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Immediately, because Herod did not give glory to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>But the word of God continued to spread and multiply.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>When Barnabas and Saul had fulfilled their mission to Jerusalem, they returned,<span class="fn">e</span>  bringing with them John, also called Mark.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, King Herod Agrippa<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">put forth the hands to mistreat</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">seize Peter—now these were the days of the Unleavened</i>; see Exodus 12:14–20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">had become furious</i> <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">had fulfilled their mission, they returned to Jerusalem</i>; NE and TR <i class="calibre6">had fulfilled their mission, they returned from Jerusalem</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
