<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">War between Asa and Baasha<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Kings 15:16–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So Asa withdrew the silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and the royal palace, and he sent it with this message to Ben-hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus:
<span class="reftext">3</span>“Let there be a treaty<span class="fn">a</span>  between me and you, between my father and your father. See, I have sent you silver and gold. Now go and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim,<span class="fn">b</span>  and all the store cities of Naphtali.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When Baasha learned of this, he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned his work.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had used for building. And with these materials he built up Geba and Mizpah.
</p><p class="hdg">Hanani’s Message to Asa</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>At that time Hanani the seer came to King Asa of Judah and told him, “Because you have relied on the king of Aram and not on <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Were not the Cushites<span class="fn">c</span>  and Libyans a vast army with many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> delivered them into your hand.
<span class="reftext">9</span>For the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> roam to and fro over all the earth, to show <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> strong on behalf of those whose hearts are fully devoted to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. You have acted foolishly in this matter. From now on, therefore, you will be at war.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Asa was angry with the seer and became so enraged over this matter that he put the man in prison. And at the same time Asa oppressed some of the people.
</p><p class="hdg">The Death and Burial of Asa</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now the rest of the acts of Asa, from beginning to end, are indeed written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
<span class="reftext">12</span>In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his malady became increasingly severe. Yet even in his illness he did not seek <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, but only the physicians.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So in the forty-first year of his reign, Asa died and rested with his fathers.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he was buried in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the <span class='cap'>City</span><span class='nocap'>city</span> of David. They laid him on a bier that was full of spices and various blended perfumes; then they made a great fire in his <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span>.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">berit</i> are translated in most passages as <i class="calibre6">covenant</i>; twice in this verse.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Abel-maim</i> was also known as <i class="calibre6">Abel-beth-maacah</i>; see 1 Kings 15:20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, people from the upper Nile region<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
