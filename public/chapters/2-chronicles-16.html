<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>War between Asa and Baasha</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign,
Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to
prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of
Judah. So Asa withdrew the silver and gold from the treasuries of the
house of the LORD and the royal palace, and he sent it with this
message to Ben-hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus: “Let
there be a treaty between me and you, between my father and your
father. See, I have sent you silver and gold. Now go and break your
treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and
sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel,
conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of
Naphtali. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Baasha learned of this, he stopped
fortifying Ramah and abandoned his work. Then King Asa brought all
the men of Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the
timbers Baasha had used for building. And with these materials he
built up Geba and Mizpah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Hanani the seer came to King
Asa of Judah and told him, “Because you have relied on the king of
Aram and not on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has
escaped from your hand. Were not the Cushites and Libyans a vast army
with many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the LORD,
He delivered them into your hand. For the eyes of the LORD roam to
and fro over all the earth, to show Himself strong on behalf of those
whose hearts are fully devoted to Him. You have acted foolishly in
this matter. From now on, therefore, you will be at war.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Asa was angry with the seer and became so
enraged over this matter that he put the man in prison. And at the
same time Asa oppressed some of the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the rest of the acts of Asa, from
beginning to end, are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of
Judah and Israel. In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became
diseased in his feet, and his malady became increasingly severe. Yet
even in his illness he did not seek the LORD, but only the
physicians. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So in the forty-first year of his reign,
Asa died and rested with his fathers. And he was buried in the tomb
that he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him
on a bier that was full of spices and various blended perfumes; then
they made a great fire in his honor. </font>
