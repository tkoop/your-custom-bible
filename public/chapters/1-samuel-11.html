<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Saul Defeats the Ammonites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Soon Nahash<span class="fn">a</span>  the Ammonite came up and laid siege to Jabesh-gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to him, “Make a treaty<span class="fn">b</span>  with us, and we will serve you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>But Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will make a treaty with you on one condition, that I may put out everyone’s right eye and bring reproach upon all Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>“Hold off for seven days,” replied the elders of Jabesh, “and let us send messengers throughout Israel. If there is no one to save us, we will surrender to you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and relayed these words in the hearing of the people, they all wept aloud.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Just then Saul was returning from the field, behind his oxen. “What troubles the people?” asked Saul. “Why are they weeping?” And they relayed to him the words of the men from Jabesh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he burned with great anger.
<span class="reftext">7</span>He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent them by messengers throughout the land of Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not march behind Saul and Samuel.” </p><p class="reg1"> Then the terror of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> fell upon the people, and they turned out as one man.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And when Saul numbered them at Bezek, there were 300,000 Israelites and 30,000<span class="fn">c</span>  men of Judah.
<span class="reftext">9</span>So they said to the messengers who had come, “Tell the men of Jabesh-gilead: ‘Deliverance will be yours tomorrow by the time the sun is hot.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1"> And when the messengers relayed this to the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Tomorrow we will come out, and you can do with us whatever seems good to you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The next day Saul organized the troops into three divisions, and during the morning watch they invaded the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them, until the hottest part of the day. And the survivors were so scattered that no two of them were left together.
</p><p class="hdg">Saul Confirmed as King</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then the people said to Samuel, “Who said that Saul should not reign over us? Bring those men here so we can kill them!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But Saul ordered, “No one shall be put to death this day, for today <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has worked salvation in Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingship there.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So all the people went to Gilgal and confirmed Saul as king in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. There they sacrificed peace offerings before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and Saul and all the Israelites rejoiced greatly.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> DSS and LXX <i class="calibre6">About a month later Nahash</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">berit</i> are translated in most passages as <i class="calibre6">covenant</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> DSS and LXX <i class="calibre6">70,000</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
