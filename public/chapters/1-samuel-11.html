<font face="Tahoma, serif">Soon Nahash the Ammonite came up and laid
siege to Jabesh-gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to him, “Make a
treaty with us, and we will serve you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will
make a treaty with you on one condition, that I may put out
everyone’s right eye and bring reproach upon all Israel.” </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Hold off for seven days,” replied the
elders of Jabesh, “and let us send messengers throughout Israel. If
there is no one to save us, we will surrender to you.” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul
and relayed these words in the hearing of the people, they all wept
aloud. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Just then Saul was returning from the
field, behind his oxen. “What troubles the people?” asked Saul.
“Why are they weeping?” And they relayed to him the words of the
men from Jabesh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of
God rushed upon him, and he burned with great anger. He took a pair
of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent them by messengers throughout
the land of Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the
oxen of anyone who does not march behind Saul and Samuel.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the terror of the LORD fell upon the
people, and they turned out as one man. And when Saul numbered them
at Bezek, there were 300,000 Israelites and 30,000 men of Judah. So
they said to the messengers who had come, “Tell the men of
Jabesh-gilead: ‘Deliverance will be yours tomorrow by the time the
sun is hot.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>

the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the men of Jabesh said to Nahash,
“Tomorrow we will come out, and you can do with us whatever seems
good to you.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The next day Saul organized the troops
into three divisions, and during the morning watch they invaded the
camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them, until the hottest part of
the day. And the survivors were so scattered that no two of them were
left together. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the people said to Samuel, “Who
said that Saul should not reign over us? Bring those men here so we
can kill them!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Saul ordered, “No one shall be put
to death this day, for today the LORD has worked salvation in
Israel.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Samuel said to the people, “Come,

<font face="Tahoma, serif">So all the people went to Gilgal and
confirmed Saul as king in the presence of the LORD. There they
sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD, and Saul and all the
Israelites rejoiced greatly. </font>
