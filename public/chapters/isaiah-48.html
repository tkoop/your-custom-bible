<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Israel’s Stubbornness</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>“Listen to this, O house of Jacob, </p><p class="indent"> you who are called by the name of Israel, </p><p class="indent1"> who have descended from the line of Judah, </p><p class="indent"> who swear by the name of the LORD, </p><p class="indent1"> who invoke the God of Israel—</p><p class="indent"> but not in truth or righteousness—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>who indeed call yourselves after the holy city </p><p class="indent"> and lean on the God of Israel; </p><p class="indent"> the LORD of Hosts is His name.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>I foretold the former things long ago; </p><p class="indent"> they came out of My mouth and I proclaimed them. </p><p class="indent"> Suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>For I knew that you are stubborn; </p><p class="indent"> your neck is iron and your forehead is bronze.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Therefore I declared it to you long ago; </p><p class="indent"> I announced it before it came to pass, </p><p class="indent1"> so that you could not claim, ‘My idol has done this; </p><p class="indent"> my carved image and molten god has ordained it.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>You have heard these things; look at them all. </p><p class="indent"> Will you not acknowledge them? </p><p class="indent1stline"> From now on I will tell you of new things, </p><p class="indent"> hidden things unknown to you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>They are created now, and not long ago; </p><p class="indent"> you have not heard of them before today. </p><p class="indent1"> So you cannot claim, </p><p class="indent">‘I already knew them!’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>You have never heard; you have never understood; </p><p class="indent"> for a long time your ears have not been open. </p><p class="indent1"> For I knew how deceitful you are; </p><p class="indent"> you have been called a rebel from birth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>For the sake of My name I will delay My wrath; </p><p class="indent"> for the sake of My praise I will restrain it, </p><p class="indent"> so that you will not be cut off.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>See, I have refined you, but not as silver; </p><p class="indent"> I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>For My own sake, My very own sake, I will act; </p><p class="indent"> for how can I let Myself be defamed? </p><p class="indent"> I will not yield My glory to another.
</p><p class="hdg">Deliverance Promised to Israel</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>Listen to Me, O Jacob, </p><p class="indent"> and Israel, whom I have called: </p><p class="indent1"> I am He; I am the first, </p><p class="indent"> and I am the last.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Surely My own hand founded the earth, </p><p class="indent"> and My right hand spread out the heavens; </p><p class="indent1"> when I summon them, </p><p class="indent"> they stand up together.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Come together, all of you, and listen: </p><p class="indent"> Which of the idols has foretold these things? </p><p class="indent1"> The LORD’s chosen ally will carry out His desire against Babylon, </p><p class="indent"> and His arm will be against the Chaldeans.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>I, even I, have spoken; </p><p class="indent"> yes, I have called him. </p><p class="indent1"> I have brought him, </p><p class="indent"> and he will succeed in his mission.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>Come near to Me and listen to this: </p><p class="indent1stline"> From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; </p><p class="indent"> from the time it happened, I was there.” </p><p class="indent1stline"> And now the Lord GOD has sent me, </p><p class="indent"> accompanied by His Spirit.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>Thus says the LORD your Redeemer, </p><p class="indent"> the Holy One of Israel: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I am the LORD your God, </p><p class="indent"> who teaches you for your benefit, </p><p class="indent"> who directs you in the way you should go.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>If only you had paid attention to My commandments, </p><p class="indent"> your peace would have been like a river, </p><p class="indent"> and your righteousness like waves of the sea.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Your descendants would have been as countless as the sand, </p><p class="indent"> and your offspring as numerous as its grains;<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> their name would never be cut off </p><p class="indent"> or eliminated from My presence.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Leave Babylon! </p><p class="indent"> Flee from the Chaldeans! </p><p class="indent1"> Declare it with a shout of joy, </p><p class="indent"> proclaim it, </p><p class="indent1"> let it go out to the ends of the earth, saying, </p><p class="indent">“The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob!”
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>They did not thirst when He led them through the deserts; </p><p class="indent"> He made water flow for them from the rock; </p><p class="indent"> He split the rock, and water gushed out.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>“There is no peace,” says the LORD, </p><p class="indent">“for the wicked.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the Babylonians; also in verse 20<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">like the sand, and your offspring like its grains</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
