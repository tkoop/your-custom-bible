<span class="reftext">2</span>And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz
<span class="reftext">3</span>to tell him, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace; for children have come to the point of birth, but there is no strength to deliver them.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Perhaps <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to defy the living God, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will rebuke him for the words that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has heard.

<span class="reftext">15</span>And Hezekiah prayed before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>: </p><p class="tab1stline">“O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth.

</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>Truly, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, the kings of Assyria have laid waste these nations and their lands.

<span class="reftext">21</span>This is the word that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has spoken against him: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘The Virgin <span class='cap'>Daughter</span><span class='nocap'>daughter</span> of Zion </p><p class="indent"> despises you and mocks you; </p><p class="indent1"> the <span class='cap'>Daughter</span><span class='nocap'>daughter</span> of Jerusalem </p><p class="indent"> shakes her head behind you.
