<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Asa Reigns in Judah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Kings 15:9–15)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the <span class='cap'>City</span><span class='nocap'>city</span><span class='bsb'>City</span> of David. And his son Asa reigned in his place, and in his days the land was at peace for ten years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> his God.
<span class="reftext">3</span>He removed the foreign altars and high places, shattered the sacred pillars, and chopped down the Asherah poles.
<span class="reftext">4</span>He commanded the people of Judah to seek <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of their fathers, and to observe the law and the commandments.
<span class="reftext">5</span>He also removed the high places and incense altars from all the cities of Judah, and under him the kingdom was at peace.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Because the land was at peace, Asa built fortified cities in Judah. In those days no one made war with him, because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had given him rest.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So he said to the people of Judah, “Let us build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, with doors and bars. The land is still ours because we have sought <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God. We have sought <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Asa had an army of 300,000 men from Judah bearing large shields and spears, and 280,000 men from Benjamin bearing small shields and drawing the bow. All these were mighty men of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Zerah the Cushite came against them with an army of 1,000,000 men<span class="fn">a</span>  and 300 chariots, and they advanced as far as Mareshah.
<span class="reftext">10</span>So Asa marched out against him and lined up in battle formation in the <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span><span class='bsb'>Valley</span> of Zephathah near Mareshah.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then Asa cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> his God: “O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, there is no one besides <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span> our God, for we rely on <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>, and in <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> name we have come against this multitude. O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> are our God. Do not let a mere mortal prevail against <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah, and the Cushites fled.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Then Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. The Cushites fell and could not recover, for they were crushed before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> army. So the people of Judah carried off a great amount of plunder
<span class="reftext">14</span>and attacked all the cities around Gerar, because the terror of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had fallen upon them. They plundered all the cities, since there was much plunder there.
<span class="reftext">15</span>They also attacked the tents of the herdsmen and carried off many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">an army of thousands and thousands</i>; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">an army of a thousand thousands</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the valley north of Mareshah</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
