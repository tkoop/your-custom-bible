<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">God’s Righteous Judgment<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 75:1–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> on another. For on whatever grounds you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> do the same things.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And we know that God’s <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> against those who do such things is based on truth.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So when you, O man, pass <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> on others, yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span>?
<span class="reftext">4</span>Or do you disregard the riches of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But because of your hard and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of wrath, when God’s righteous <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> will be revealed.
<span class="reftext">6</span>God “will repay each one according to his deeds.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">7</span>To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span>, and immortality, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will give eternal life.
<span class="reftext">8</span>But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow wickedness, there will be wrath and anger.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil, first for the Jew, then for the Greek;
<span class="reftext">10</span>but glory, <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span>, and peace for everyone who does good, first for the Jew, then for the Greek.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For God does not show favoritism.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be declared righteous.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.
<span class="reftext">15</span>So they show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or defending them
<span class="reftext">16</span>on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Christ Jesus,<span class="fn">b</span>  as proclaimed by my gospel.
</p><p class="hdg">The Jews and the Law</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God;
<span class="reftext">18</span>if you know <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;
<span class="reftext">19</span>if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness,
<span class="reftext">20</span>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—
<span class="reftext">21</span>you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
<span class="reftext">22</span>You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
<span class="reftext">23</span>You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
<span class="reftext">24</span>As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
<span class="reftext">26</span>If a man who is not circumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?
<span class="reftext">27</span>The one who is physically uncircumcised yet keeps the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>A man is not a Jew because he is one outwardly, nor is circumcision only outward and physical.
<span class="reftext">29</span>No, a man is a Jew because he is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, not by the written code. Such a man’s praise does not come from men, but from God.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Psalm 62:12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">through Jesus Christ</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Isaiah 52:5 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
