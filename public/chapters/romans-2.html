<font ><b>God’s Righteous Judgment</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >You, therefore, have no excuse, you who
pass judgment on another. For on whatever grounds you judge the
other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do
the same things. And we know that God’s judgment against those who
do such things is based on truth. So when you, O man, pass judgment
on others, yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s
judgment? Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance,
and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to
repentance? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But because of your hard and unrepentant
heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of
wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed. God “will
repay each one according to his deeds.” To those who by
perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He
will give eternal life. But for those who are self-seeking and who
reject the truth and follow wickedness, there will be wrath and
anger. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >There will be trouble and distress for
every human being who does evil, first for the Jew, then for the
Greek; but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, first
for the Jew, then for the Greek. For God does not show favoritism. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >All who sin apart from the law will also
perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be
judged by the law. For it is not the hearers of the law who are
righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be
declared righteous. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the
law, do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to
themselves, even though they do not have the law. So they show that
the work of the law is written on their hearts, their consciences
also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or defending
them on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Christ
Jesus, as proclaimed by my gospel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if
you rely on the law and boast in God; if you know His will and
approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law; if
you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for
those in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of
infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and
truth— you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You
who preach against stealing, do you steal? You who forbid adultery,
do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? You
who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? As it
is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because
of you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Circumcision has value if you observe the
law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become
uncircumcision. If a man who is not circumcised keeps the
requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as
circumcision? The one who is physically uncircumcised yet keeps the
law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and
circumcision, are a lawbreaker. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >A man is not a Jew because he is one
outwardly, nor is circumcision only outward and physical. No, a man
is a Jew because he is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of
the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man’s
praise does not come from men, but from God. </font>
