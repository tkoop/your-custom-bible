<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Cupbearer and the Baker</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Some time later, the king’s cupbearer and baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, the same prison where Joseph was confined.
<span class="reftext">4</span>The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he became their personal attendant. </p><p class="reg1"> After they had been in custody for some time,
<span class="reftext">5</span>both of these men—the Egyptian king’s cupbearer and baker, who were being held in the prison—had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were distraught.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So he asked the officials of Pharaoh who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why are <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faces so downcast today?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>“We both had dreams,” they replied, “but there is no one to interpret them.” </p><p class="reg1"> Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Tell me <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> dreams.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream: “In my dream there was a vine before me,
<span class="reftext">10</span>and on the vine were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and placed the cup in his hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three branches are three days.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore your position. You will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you did when you were his cupbearer.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But when it goes well for you, please remember me and show me kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh, that he might bring me out of this prison.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing for which they should have put me in this dungeon.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was <span class='spell ca'>favourable</span><span class='spell gb'>favourable</span><span class='spell us'>favorable</span>, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: There were three baskets of white bread on my head.
<span class="reftext">17</span>In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree.<span class="fn">a</span>  Then the birds will eat the flesh of your body.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he held a feast for all his officials, and in their presence he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But Pharaoh hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had described to them in his interpretation.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot all about him.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">and impale you on a pole</i>; similarly in verse 22<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">had interpreted to them</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
