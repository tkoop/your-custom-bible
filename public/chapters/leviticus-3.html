“<font >If one’s offering is a peace offering
and he offers an animal from the herd, whether male or female, he
must present it without blemish before the LORD. He is to lay his
hand on the head of the offering and slaughter it at the entrance to
the Tent of Meeting. Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle
the blood on all sides of the altar. </font>

<font >From the peace offering he is to bring an
offering made by fire to the LORD: the fat that covers the entrails,
all the fat that is on them, both kidneys with the fat on them near
the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to remove with the
kidneys. Then Aaron’s sons are to burn it on the altar atop the
burnt offering that is on the burning wood, as an offering made by
fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. </font>

an offering made by fire to the LORD consisting of its fat: the
entire fat tail cut off close to the backbone, the fat that covers
the entrails, all the fat that is on them, both kidneys with the fat
on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to
remove with the kidneys. Then the priest is to burn them on the altar
as food, an offering made by fire to the LORD. </font>
