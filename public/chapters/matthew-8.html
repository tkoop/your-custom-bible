<span class="reftext">2</span>Suddenly a leper<span class="fn">a</span>  came and knelt before Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. <span>“I am willing,”</span> He said. <span>“Be clean!”</span> And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Jesus instructed him, <span>“See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift prescribed by Moses, as a testimony to them.”<span class="fn">b</span> </span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Faith of the Centurion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 7:1–10; John 4:43–54)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came and pleaded with Him,
<span class="reftext">6</span>“Lord, my servant<span class="fn">c</span>  lies at home, paralyzed and in terrible agony.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">7</span>“I will go and heal him,”</span> Jesus replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy to have You come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
<span class="reftext">9</span>For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes; and another to come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>When Jesus heard this, He marvelled and said to those following Him, <span>“Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
<span class="reftext">11</span>I say to you that many will come from the east and the west to share the banquet with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then Jesus said to the centurion, <span>“Go! As you have believed, so will it be done for you.”</span> And his servant was healed at that very hour.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals at Peter’s House<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 1:29–34; Luke 4:38–41)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When Jesus arrived at Peter’s house, He saw Peter’s mother-in-law sick in bed with a fever.
<span class="reftext">15</span>So He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
<span class="reftext">17</span>This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: </p><p class="indent1stline">“He took on our infirmities </p><p class="indent"> and carried our diseases.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Cost of Discipleship<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 9:57–62; Luke 14:25–33; John 6:59–66)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>When Jesus saw a large crowd around Him, He gave orders to cross to the other side of the sea.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And one of the scribes came to Him and said, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Another of His disciples requested, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But Jesus told him, <span>“Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Calms the Storm<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 107:1–43; Mark 4:35–41; Luke 8:22–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat was engulfed by the waves; but Jesus was sleeping.
<span class="reftext">25</span>The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">26</span>“You of little faith,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“why are you so afraid?”</span> Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was perfectly calm.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!”
</p><p class="hdg">The Demons and the Pigs<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 5:1–20; Luke 8:26–39)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gadarenes,<span class="fn">f</span>  He was met by two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>“What do You want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have You come here to torture us before the appointed time?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>In the distance a large herd of pigs was feeding.
<span class="reftext">31</span>So the demons begged Jesus, “If You drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">32</span>“Go!”</span> He told them. So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the waters.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Those tending the pigs ran off into the town and reported all this, including the account of the demon-possessed men.
<span class="reftext">34</span>Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> A <i class="calibre6">leper</i> was one afflicted with a skin disease.
