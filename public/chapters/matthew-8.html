<font >When Jesus came down from the mountain,
large crowds followed Him. Suddenly a leper came and knelt before
Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Jesus reached out His hand and touched the
man. <font color="#a80000">“I am willing,”</font> He said. <font color="#a80000">“Be
clean!”</font> And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Jesus instructed him, <font color="#a80000">“See
that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and
offer the gift prescribed by Moses, as a testimony to them.” </font></font>

<font >When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a
centurion came and pleaded with Him, “Lord, my servant lies at
home, paralyzed and in terrible agony.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >I will go and
heal him,”</font> Jesus replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not
worthy to have You come under my roof. But just say the word, and my
servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with
soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes; and another to
come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do something, and he does
it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Jesus heard this, He marveled and
said to those following Him, <font color="#a80000">“Truly I tell
you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say
to you that many will come from the east and the west to share the
banquet with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But
the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where
there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to the centurion, <font color="#a80000">“Go!
As you have believed, so will it be done for you.”</font> And his
servant was healed at that very hour. </font>

<font >When Jesus arrived at Peter’s house, He
saw Peter’s mother-in-law sick in bed with a fever. So He touched
her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve
them. </font>

<font >When evening came, many who were
demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and He drove out the spirits
with a word and healed all the sick. This was to fulfill what was
spoken through the prophet Isaiah: </font>

<font >When Jesus saw a large crowd around Him,
He gave orders to cross to the other side of the sea. And one of the

You go.” </font>

<font >When He got into the boat, His disciples
followed Him. Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that
the boat was engulfed by the waves; but Jesus was sleeping. The
disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are
perishing!” </font>

<font color="#a80000">“<font >You of little

so afraid?”</font> Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the
sea, and it was perfectly calm. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The men were amazed and asked, “What
kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!” </font>

<font >When Jesus arrived on the other side in
the region of the Gadarenes, He was met by two demon-possessed men
coming from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass
that way. </font>

<font >In the distance a large herd of pigs was
feeding. So the demons begged Jesus, “If You drive us out, send us
into the herd of pigs.” </font>

<font color="#a80000">“<font >Go!”</font> He
told them. So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Those tending the pigs ran off into the
town and reported all this, including the account of the
demon-possessed men. Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And
when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region. </font>
