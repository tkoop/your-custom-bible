<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Paul’s Ministry</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> yourselves know, brothers, that our visit to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> was not in vain.
<span class="reftext">2</span>As <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are aware, we had already endured suffering and shameful treatment in Philippi. But in the face of strong opposition, we were bold in our God to speak to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> the gospel of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For our appeal does not arise from deceit or ulterior motives or trickery.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Instead, we speak as those approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, not in order to please men but God, who examines our hearts.
<span class="reftext">5</span>As <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> know, we never used words of flattery or any pretext for greed. God is our witness!
<span class="reftext">6</span>Nor did we seek praise from <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> or from anyone else, although as apostles of Christ we had authority to demand it.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>On the contrary, we were gentle among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>,<span class="fn">b</span>  like a nursing mother caring for her children.
<span class="reftext">8</span>We cared so deeply that we were delighted to share with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not only the gospel of God, but our own lives as well. That is how beloved <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have become to us.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Surely <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> recall, brothers, our <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> and toil. We worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to anyone while we proclaimed to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> the gospel of God.
<span class="reftext">10</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous, and blameless our conduct was among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> who believed.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> know that we treated each of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> as a father treats his own children—
<span class="reftext">12</span>encouraging <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, comforting <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and urging <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> into <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own kingdom and glory.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And we continually thank God because, when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> received the word of God that you heard from us, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> accepted it not as the word of men, but as the true word of God—the word which is now at work in <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> who believe.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Judea that are in Christ Jesus. <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> suffered from <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> own countrymen the very things they suffered from the Jews,
<span class="reftext">15</span>who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and drove us out as well. They are displeasing to God and hostile to all men,
<span class="reftext">16</span>hindering us from telling the Gentiles how they may be saved. As a result, they continue to heap up their sins to full capacity; the utmost wrath has come upon them.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Longing to Visit</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Brothers, although we were torn away from <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> for a short time (in person, not in heart), our desire to see <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> face to face was even more intense.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For we wanted to come to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>—indeed I, Paul, tried again and again—but Satan obstructed us.
<span class="reftext">19</span>After all, who is our hope, our joy, our crown of boasting, if it is not <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> yourselves in the presence of our Lord Jesus at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> coming?
<span class="reftext">20</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are indeed our glory and our joy.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">although as apostles of Christ we could have been a burden to you</i>; SBL, NE, and WH include this phrase with verse 7.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> WH and NA <i class="calibre6">we were like young children among you</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">at last the wrath (of God) has come upon them.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
