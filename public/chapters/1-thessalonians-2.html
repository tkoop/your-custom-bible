<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You yourselves know, brothers, that our
visit to you was not in vain. As you are aware, we had already
endured suffering and shameful treatment in Philippi. But in the face
of strong opposition, we were bold in our God to speak to you the
gospel of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For our appeal does not arise from deceit
or ulterior motives or trickery. Instead, we speak as those approved
by God to be entrusted with the gospel, not in order to please men
but God, who examines our hearts. As you know, we never used words of
flattery or any pretext for greed. God is our witness! Nor did we
seek praise from you or from anyone else, although as apostles of
Christ we had authority to demand it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the contrary, we were gentle among you,
like a nursing mother caring for her children. We cared so deeply
that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God,
but our own lives as well. That is how beloved you have become to us.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Surely you recall, brothers, our labor and
toil. We worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to
anyone while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. You are
witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous, and blameless our
conduct was among you who believed. For you know that we treated each
of you as a father treats his own children— encouraging you,
comforting you, and urging you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who
calls you into His own kingdom and glory. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And we continually thank God because, when
you received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it
not as the word of men, but as the true word of God—the word which
is now at work in you who believe. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For you, brothers, became imitators of the
churches of God in Judea that are in Christ Jesus. You suffered from
your own countrymen the very things they suffered from the Jews, who
killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and drove us out
as well. They are displeasing to God and hostile to all men,
hindering us from telling the Gentiles how they may be saved. As a
result, they continue to heap up their sins to full capacity; the
utmost wrath has come upon them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Brothers, although we were torn away from
you for a short time (in person, not in heart), our desire to see you
face to face was even more intense. For we wanted to come to
you—indeed I, Paul, tried again and again—but Satan obstructed
us. After all, who is our hope, our joy, our crown of boasting, if it
is not you yourselves in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His
coming? You are indeed our glory and our joy. </font>
