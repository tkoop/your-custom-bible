<font >Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Grace, mercy, and peace from God the
Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I thank God, whom I serve with a clear
conscience as did my forefathers, as I constantly remember you night
and day in my prayers. Recalling your tears, I long to see you so
that I may be filled with joy. </font>

<font >I am reminded of your sincere faith, which
first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am
convinced is in you as well. </font>

<font >For this reason I remind you to fan into
flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my
hands. For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love,
and self-control. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So do not be ashamed of the testimony of
our Lord, or of me, His prisoner. Instead, join me in suffering for
the gospel by the power of God. He has saved us and called us to a
holy calling, not because of our works, but by His own purpose and by
the grace He granted us in Christ Jesus before time began. And now He
has revealed this grace through the appearing of our Savior, Christ
Jesus, who has abolished death and illuminated the way to life and
immortality through the gospel, to which I was appointed as a
preacher, an apostle, and a teacher. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this reason, even though I suffer as I
do, I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and I am
convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him for
that day. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching
you have heard from me, with the faith and love that are in Christ
Jesus. Guard the treasure entrusted to you, with the help of the Holy
Spirit who dwells in us. </font>

<font >May the Lord grant mercy to the household
of Onesiphorus, because he has often refreshed me and was unashamed
of my chains. Indeed, when he arrived in Rome, he searched diligently
until he found me. </font>

<font >May the Lord grant Onesiphorus His mercy
on that day. You know very well how much he ministered to me in
Ephesus. </font>
