<span class="reftext">4</span>Recalling your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced is in you as well.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For God has not given us a spirit of fear,<span class="fn">a</span>  but of power, love, and self-control.

<span class="reftext">11</span>to which I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>For this reason, even though I suffer as I do, I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> is able to guard what I have entrusted to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span><span class="fn">c</span>  for that day.
