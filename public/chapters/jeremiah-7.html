<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jeremiah’s Message at the Temple Gate</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Stand in the gate of the house of the LORD and proclaim this message: Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah who enter through these gates to worship the LORD.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Thus says the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel: Correct your ways and deeds, and I will let you live in this place.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Do not trust in deceptive words, chanting: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘This is the temple of the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> the temple of the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> the temple of the LORD.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>For if you really correct your ways and deeds, if you act justly toward one another,
<span class="reftext">6</span>if you no longer oppress the foreigner and the fatherless and the widow, and if you no longer shed innocent blood in this place or follow other gods to your own harm,
<span class="reftext">7</span>then I will let you live in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But look, you keep trusting in deceptive words to no avail.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods that you have not known,
<span class="reftext">10</span>and then come and stand before Me in this house, which bears My Name, and say, ‘We are delivered, so we can continue with all these abominations’?
<span class="reftext">11</span>Has this house, which bears My Name, become a den of robbers<span class="fn">a</span>  in your sight? Yes, I too have seen it, declares the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for My Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel.
<span class="reftext">13</span>And now, because you have done all these things, declares the LORD, and because I have spoken to you again and again<span class="fn">b</span>  but you would not listen, and I have called to you but you would not answer,
<span class="reftext">14</span>therefore what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears My Name, the house in which you trust, the place that I gave to you and your fathers.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And I will cast you out of My presence, just as I have cast out all your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim.
</p><p class="hdg">Judah’s Idolatry Persists</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>As for you, do not pray for these people, do not offer a plea or petition on their behalf, and do not beg Me, for I will not listen to you.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
<span class="reftext">18</span>The sons gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven; they pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke Me to anger.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But am I the One they are provoking? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves they spite, to their own shame?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, My anger and My fury will be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the trees of the field and the produce of the land, and it will burn and not be extinguished.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves!
<span class="reftext">22</span>For when I brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt, I did not merely command them about burnt offerings and sacrifices,
<span class="reftext">23</span>but this is what I commanded them: Obey Me, and I will be your God, and you will be My people. You must walk in all the ways I have commanded you, so that it may go well with you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but they followed the stubborn inclinations of their own evil hearts. They went backward and not forward.
<span class="reftext">25</span>From the day your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My servants the prophets again and again.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Yet they would not listen to Me or incline their ear, but they stiffened their necks and did more evil than their fathers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>When you tell them all these things, they will not listen to you. When you call to them, they will not answer.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Therefore you must say to them, ‘This is the nation that would not listen to the voice of the LORD their God and would not receive correction. Truth has perished; it has disappeared from their lips.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Cut off your hair and throw it away. Raise up a lamentation on the barren heights, for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.’
</p><p class="hdg">The Valley of Slaughter</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>For the people of Judah have done evil in My sight, declares the LORD. They have set up their abominations in the house that bears My Name, and so have defiled it.
<span class="reftext">31</span>They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom so they could burn their sons and daughters in the fire—something I never commanded, nor did it even enter My mind.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>So behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when this place will no longer be called Topheth and the Valley of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. For they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.
<span class="reftext">33</span>The corpses of this people will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to scare them away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>I will remove from the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem the sounds of joy and gladness and the voices of the bride and bridegroom, for the land will become a wasteland.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in Matthew 21:13, Mark 11:17, and Luke 19:46<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">I have sent you all My servants the prophets daily, rising up early and sending (them).</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
