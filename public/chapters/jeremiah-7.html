<font ><b>Jeremiah’s Message at the Temple Gate</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the word that came to Jeremiah
from the LORD, saying, “Stand in the gate of the house of the LORD
and proclaim this message: Hear the word of the LORD, all you people
of Judah who enter through these gates to worship the LORD. Thus says
the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel: Correct your ways and deeds,
and I will let you live in this place. Do not trust in deceptive
words, chanting: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >This is the temple of the LORD, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >the temple of the LORD, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >the temple of the LORD.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For if you really correct your ways and
deeds, if you act justly toward one another, if you no longer oppress
the foreigner and the fatherless and the widow, and if you no longer
shed innocent blood in this place or follow other gods to your own
harm, then I will let you live in this place, in the land that I gave
to your fathers forever and ever. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But look, you keep trusting in deceptive
words to no avail. Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and
perjury, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods that you have
not known, and then come and stand before Me in this house, which
bears My Name, and say, ‘We are delivered, so we can continue with
all these abominations’? Has this house, which bears My Name,
become a den of robbers in your sight? Yes, I too have seen it,
declares the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But go now to the place in Shiloh where I
first made a dwelling for My Name, and see what I did to it because
of the wickedness of My people Israel. And now, because you have done
all these things, declares the LORD, and because I have spoken to you
again and again but you would not listen, and I have called to you
but you would not answer, therefore what I did to Shiloh I will now
do to the house that bears My Name, the house in which you trust, the
place that I gave to you and your fathers. And I will cast you out of
My presence, just as I have cast out all your brothers, all the
descendants of Ephraim. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for you, do not pray for these people,
do not offer a plea or petition on their behalf, and do not beg Me,
for I will not listen to you. Do you not see what they are doing in
the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The sons gather
wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough to
make cakes for the Queen of Heaven; they pour out drink offerings to
other gods to provoke Me to anger. But am I the One they are
provoking? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves they spite, to
their own shame? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
Behold, My anger and My fury will be poured out on this place, on man
and beast, on the trees of the field and the produce of the land, and
it will burn and not be extinguished. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of
Israel, says: Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and
eat the meat yourselves! For when I brought your fathers out of the
land of Egypt, I did not merely command them about burnt offerings
and sacrifices, but this is what I commanded them: Obey Me, and I
will be your God, and you will be My people. You must walk in all the
ways I have commanded you, so that it may go well with you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet they did not listen or incline their
ear, but they followed the stubborn inclinations of their own evil
hearts. They went backward and not forward. From the day your fathers
came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My
servants the prophets again and again. Yet they would not listen to
Me or incline their ear, but they stiffened their necks and did more
evil than their fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When you tell them all these things, they
will not listen to you. When you call to them, they will not answer.
Therefore you must say to them, ‘This is the nation that would not
listen to the voice of the LORD their God and would not receive
correction. Truth has perished; it has disappeared from their lips.
Cut off your hair and throw it away. Raise up a lamentation on the
barren heights, for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation
of His wrath.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the people of Judah have done evil in
My sight, declares the LORD. They have set up their abominations in
the house that bears My Name, and so have defiled it. They have built
the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom so they could burn
their sons and daughters in the fire—something I never commanded,
nor did it even enter My mind. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So behold, the days are coming, declares
the LORD, when this place will no longer be called Topheth and the
Valley of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. For they will bury the
dead in Topheth until there is no more room. The corpses of this
people will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of
the earth, and there will be no one to scare them away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I will remove from the cities of Judah and
the streets of Jerusalem the sounds of joy and gladness and the
voices of the bride and bridegroom, for the land will become a
wasteland.” </font>
