<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Pool of Bethesda</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Some time later there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool with five covered colonnades, which in Hebrew<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">a</a></span>  is called Bethesda.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">b</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a><span class="reftext">3</span>On these walkways<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">c</a></span>  lay a great number of the sick, the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">d</a></span>

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>One man there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a><span class="reftext">6</span>When Jesus saw him lying there and realized that he had spent a long time in this condition, He asked him, <span>“Do you want to get well?”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am on my way, someone else goes in before me.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Jesus told him, <span>“Get up, pick up your mat, and walk.”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Immediately the man was made well, and he picked up his mat and began to walk. </p><p class="reg1"> Now this happened on the Sabbath day,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a><span class="reftext">10</span>so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath! It is unlawful for you to carry your mat.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, <span>‘Pick up your mat and walk.’</span>”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“Who is this man who told you to pick it up and walk?” they asked.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while the crowd was there.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Afterward, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him, <span>“See, you have been made well. Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you.”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And the man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a></p><p class="hdg">The Father and the Son</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews began to persecute Him.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a><span class="reftext">17</span>But Jesus answered them, <span>“To this very day My Father is at His work, and I too am working.”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Because of this, the Jews tried all the harder to kill Him. Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So Jesus replied, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, unless He sees the Father doing it. For whatever the Father does, the Son also does.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a><span class="reftext">20</span>The Father loves the Son and shows Him all He does. And to your amazement, He will show Him even greater works than these.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="21"></a><span class="reftext">21</span>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wishes.</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">22</span>Furthermore, the Father judges no one, but has assigned all judgment to the Son,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="23"></a><span class="reftext">23</span>so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="24"></a></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">24</span>Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life and will not come under judgment. Indeed, he has crossed over from death to life.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">25</span>Truly, truly, I tell you, the hour is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="26"></a><span class="reftext">26</span>For as the Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted the Son to have life in Himself.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="27"></a><span class="reftext">27</span>And He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="28"></a></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>Do not be amazed at this, for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear His voice
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="29"></a><span class="reftext">29</span>and come out—those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">e</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="30"></a></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">30</span>I can do nothing by Myself; I judge only as I hear. And My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="31"></a></p><p class="hdg">Testimonies about Jesus</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>If I testify about Myself, My testimony is not valid.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="32"></a><span class="reftext">32</span>There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that His testimony about Me is valid.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="36"></a><span class="reftext">36</span>But I have testimony more substantial than that of John. For the works that the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very works I am doing—testify about Me that the Father has sent Me.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="37"></a><span class="reftext">37</span>And the Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me. You have never heard His voice nor seen His form,
