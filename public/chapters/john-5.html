<font ><b>The Pool of Bethesda</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some time later there was a feast of the
Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep
Gate a pool with five covered colonnades, which in Hebrew is called
Bethesda. On these walkways lay a great number of the sick, the
blind, the lame, and the paralyzed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One man there had been an invalid for
thirty-eight years. When Jesus saw him lying there and realized that
he had spent a long time in this condition, He asked him, <font color="#a80000">“Do
you want to get well?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have
no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am
on my way, someone else goes in before me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus told him, <font color="#a80000">“Get
up, pick up your mat, and walk.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Immediately the man was made well, and he
picked up his mat and began to walk. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now this happened on the Sabbath day, so
the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath!
It is unlawful for you to carry your mat.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But he answered, “The man who made me
well told me, <font color="#a80000">‘Pick up your mat and walk.’</font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Who is this man who told you to pick it
up and walk?” they asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the man who was healed did not know
who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while the crowd was there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Afterward, Jesus found the man at the
temple and said to him, <font color="#a80000">“See, you have been
made well. Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the man went away and told the Jews
that it was Jesus who had made him well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now because Jesus was doing these things
on the Sabbath, the Jews began to persecute Him. But Jesus answered
them, <font color="#a80000">“To this very day My Father is at His
work, and I too am working.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because of this, the Jews tried all the
harder to kill Him. Not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but He was
even calling God His own Father, making Himself equal with God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Truly,
truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, unless He sees
the Father doing it. For whatever the Father does, the Son also does.
The Father loves the Son and shows Him all He does. And to your
amazement, He will show Him even greater works than these. For just
as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son
gives life to whom He wishes.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Furthermore, the
Father judges no one, but has assigned all judgment to the Son, so
that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever
does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Truly, truly, I tell
you, whoever hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal
life and will not come under judgment. Indeed, he has crossed over
from death to life. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Truly, truly, I tell
you, the hour is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the
voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For as the
Father has life in Himself, so also He has granted the Son to have
life in Himself. And He has given Him authority to execute judgment,
because He is the Son of Man. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Do not be amazed at
this, for the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will
hear His voice and come out—those who have done good to the
resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the
resurrection of judgment. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >I can do nothing by
Myself; I judge only as I hear. And My judgment is just, because I do
not seek My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >If I testify about
Myself, My testimony is not valid. There is another who testifies
about Me, and I know that His testimony about Me is valid. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >You have sent to
John, and he has testified to the truth. Even though I do not accept
human testimony, I say these things so that you may be saved. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >John was a lamp that
burned and gave light, and you were willing for a season to bask in
his light. But I have testimony more substantial than that of John.
For the works that the Father has given Me to accomplish—the very
works I am doing—testify about Me that the Father has sent Me. And
the Father who sent Me has Himself testified about Me. You have never
heard His voice nor seen His form, nor does His word abide in you,
because you do not believe the One He sent. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >You pore over the
Scriptures because you presume that by them you possess eternal life.
These are the very words that testify about Me, yet you refuse to
come to Me to have life. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >I do not accept
glory from men, but I know you, that you do not have the love of God
within you. I have come in My Father’s name, and you have not
received Me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will
receive him. How can you believe if you accept glory from one
another, yet do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Do not think that I
will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, in whom you
have put your hope. If you had believed Moses, you would believe Me,
because he wrote about Me. But since you do not believe what he
wrote, how will you believe what I say?” </font></font>
