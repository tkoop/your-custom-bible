<span class="reftext">3</span>On these walkways<span class="fn">c</span>  lay a great number of the sick, the blind, the lame, and the paralyzed.<span class="fn">d</span> 

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>One man there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
<span class="reftext">6</span>When Jesus saw him lying there and <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that he had spent a long time in this condition, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> asked him, <span>“Do you want to get well?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am on my way, someone else goes in before me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Jesus told him, <span>“Get up, pick up your mat, and walk.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Immediately the man was made well, and he picked up his mat and began to walk. </p><p class="reg1"> Now this happened on the Sabbath day,
<span class="reftext">10</span>so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “This is the Sabbath! It is unlawful for you to carry your mat.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, <span>‘Pick up your mat and walk.’</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“Who is this man who told you to pick it up and walk?” they asked.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away while the crowd was there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Afterward, Jesus found the man at the temple and said to him, <span>“See, you have been made well. Stop sinning, or something worse may happen to you.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And the man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
</p><p class="hdg">The Father and the Son</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews began to persecute <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span class="reftext">17</span>But Jesus answered them, <span>“To this very day <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> is at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> work, and I too am working.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Because of this, the Jews tried all the harder to kill <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So Jesus replied, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> can do nothing by <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span><span class='bsb'>Himself</span>, unless <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> sees the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> doing it.
