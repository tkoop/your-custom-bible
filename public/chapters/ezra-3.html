<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By the seventh month, the Israelites had
settled in their towns, and the people assembled as one man in
Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his fellow
priests, along with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his associates,
began to build the altar of the God of Israel to sacrifice burnt
offerings on it, as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.
They set up the altar on its foundation and sacrificed burnt
offerings on it to the LORD—both the morning and evening burnt
offerings—even though they feared the people of the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They also celebrated the Feast of
Tabernacles in accordance with what is written, and they offered
burnt offerings daily based on the number prescribed for each day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After that, they presented the regular
burnt offerings and those for New Moons and for all the appointed
sacred feasts of the LORD, as well as all the freewill offerings
brought to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the first day of the seventh month, the
Israelites began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, although the
foundation of the temple of the LORD had not been laid. They gave
money to the masons and carpenters, and food and drink and oil to the
people of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar logs from Lebanon to Joppa by
sea, as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the second month of the second year
after they had arrived at the house of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel
son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak, and the rest of their
associates including the priests, the Levites, and all who had
returned to Jerusalem from the captivity, began the work. They
appointed Levites twenty years of age or older to supervise the
construction of the house of the LORD. So Jeshua and his sons and
brothers, Kadmiel and his sons (descendants of Yehudah), and the sons
of Henadad and their sons and brothers—all Levites—joined
together to supervise those working on the house of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the builders had laid the foundation
of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their apparel with
trumpets, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with cymbals, took
their positions to praise the LORD, as David king of Israel had
prescribed. And they sang responsively with praise and thanksgiving
to the LORD: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">For He is good; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">for His loving devotion to Israel endures
forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all the people gave a great shout of
praise to the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD
had been laid. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But many of the older priests, Levites,
and family heads who had seen the first temple wept loudly when they
saw the foundation of this temple. Still, many others shouted
joyfully. The people could not distinguish the shouts of joy from the
sound of weeping, because the people were making so much noise. And
the sound was heard from afar. </font>
