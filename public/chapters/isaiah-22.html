<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Valley of Vision</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is the burden against the Valley of Vision: </p><p class="indent1stline"> What ails you now, </p><p class="indent"> that you have all gone up to the rooftops,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>O city of commotion, </p><p class="indent"> O town of revelry? </p><p class="indent1stline"> Your slain did not die by the sword, </p><p class="indent"> nor were they killed in battle.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>All your rulers have fled together, </p><p class="indent"> captured without a bow. </p><p class="indent1"> All your fugitives were captured together, </p><p class="indent"> having fled to a distant place.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Therefore I said, </p><p class="indent">“Turn away from me, let me weep bitterly! </p><p class="indent1"> Do not try to console me </p><p class="indent"> over the destruction of the daughter of my people.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>For the Lord GOD of Hosts has set a day </p><p class="indent"> of tumult and trampling and confusion in the Valley of Vision—</p><p class="indent1"> of breaking down the walls </p><p class="indent"> and crying to the mountains.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Elam takes up a quiver, with chariots and horsemen, </p><p class="indent"> and Kir uncovers the shield.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, </p><p class="indent"> and horsemen are posted at the gates.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>He has uncovered </p><p class="indent"> the defences of Judah. </p><p class="reg1"> On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest.
<span class="reftext">9</span>You saw that there were many breaches in the walls of the City of David. You collected water from the lower pool.
<span class="reftext">10</span>You counted the houses of Jerusalem and tore them down to strengthen the wall.
<span class="reftext">11</span>You built a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the ancient pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or consider Him who planned it long ago.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>On that day the Lord GOD of Hosts </p><p class="indent"> called for weeping and wailing, </p><p class="indent1"> for shaven heads </p><p class="indent"> and the wearing of sackcloth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But look, there is joy and gladness, </p><p class="indent"> butchering of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, </p><p class="indent1"> eating of meat and drinking of wine: </p><p class="indent">“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The LORD of Hosts has revealed in my hearing: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Until your dying day, </p><p class="indent"> this sin of yours will never be atoned for,” </p><p class="selah"> says the Lord GOD of Hosts.
</p><p class="hdg">A Message for Shebna</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>This is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: “Go, say to Shebna, the steward in charge of the palace:
<span class="reftext">16</span>What are you doing here, and who authorized you to carve out a tomb for yourself here—to chisel your tomb in the height and cut your resting place in the rock?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Look, O mighty man! The LORD is about to shake you violently. He will take hold of you,
<span class="reftext">18</span>roll you into a ball, and sling you into a wide land. There you will die, and there your glorious chariots will remain—a disgrace to the house of your master.
<span class="reftext">19</span>I will remove you from office, and you will be ousted from your position.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>On that day I will summon My servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
<span class="reftext">21</span>I will clothe him with your robe and tie your sash around him. I will put your authority in his hand, and he will be a father to the dwellers of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
<span class="reftext">22</span>I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">23</span>I will drive him like a peg into a firm place, and he will be a throne of glory for the house of his father.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So they will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house: the descendants and the offshoots—all the lesser vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>In that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, the peg driven into a firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and fall, and the load upon it will be cut down.” </p><p class="reg1"> Indeed, the LORD has spoken.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in 1 Corinthians 15:32<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> See Revelation 3:7.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
