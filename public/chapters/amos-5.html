<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Lamentation against Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Hear this word, O house of Israel, this lamentation I take up against you:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Fallen is Virgin Israel, </p><p class="indent"> never to rise again. </p><p class="indent1"> She lies abandoned on her land, </p><p class="indent"> with no one to raise her up.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“The city that marches out a thousand strong </p><p class="indent"> will only see a hundred return, </p><p class="indent1"> and the one that marches out a hundred strong </p><p class="indent"> will have but ten left in the house of Israel.”
</p><p class="hdg">A Call to Repentance<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Joel 1:13–20; Zephaniah 2:1–3; Luke 13:1–5)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>For this is what the LORD says to the house of Israel: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Seek Me and live!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Do not seek Bethel or go to Gilgal; </p><p class="indent"> do not journey to Beersheba, </p><p class="indent1"> for Gilgal will surely go into exile, </p><p class="indent"> and Bethel will come to nothing.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Seek the LORD and live, </p><p class="indent"> or He will sweep like fire through the house of Joseph; </p><p class="indent1"> it will devour everything, </p><p class="indent"> with no one at Bethel to extinguish it.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>There are those who turn justice into wormwood </p><p class="indent"> and cast righteousness to the ground.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>He who made the Pleiades and Orion, </p><p class="indent"> who turns darkness into dawn </p><p class="indent"> and darkens day into night, </p><p class="indent1"> who summons the waters of the sea </p><p class="indent"> and pours them over the face of the earth—</p><p class="indent"> the LORD is His name—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>He flashes destruction on the strong, </p><p class="indent"> so that fury comes upon the stronghold.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>There are those who hate the one who reproves in the gate </p><p class="indent"> and despise him who speaks with integrity.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore, because you trample on the poor </p><p class="indent"> and exact from him a tax of grain, </p><p class="indent1"> you will never live </p><p class="indent"> in the stone houses you have built; </p><p class="indent1"> you will never drink the wine </p><p class="indent"> from the lush vineyards you have planted.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>For I know that your transgressions are many </p><p class="indent"> and your sins are numerous. </p><p class="indent1"> You oppress the righteous by taking bribes; </p><p class="indent"> you deprive the poor of justice in the gate.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore, the prudent keep silent in such times, </p><p class="indent"> for the days are evil.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>Seek good, not evil, </p><p class="indent"> so that you may live. </p><p class="indent1"> And the LORD, the God of Hosts, </p><p class="indent"> will be with you, as you have claimed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Hate evil and love good; </p><p class="indent"> establish justice in the gate. </p><p class="indent1"> Perhaps the LORD, the God of Hosts, </p><p class="indent"> will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.”
</p><p class="hdg">Woe to Rebellious Israel<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 7:39–43)</span></p><p class="indent1stline"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Hosts, the Lord, says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“There will be wailing in all the public squares </p><p class="indent"> and cries of ‘Alas! Alas!’ in all the streets. </p><p class="indent1"> The farmer will be summoned to mourn, </p><p class="indent"> and the mourners to wail.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>There will be wailing in all the vineyards, </p><p class="indent"> for I will pass through your midst,” </p><p class="selah"> says the LORD.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Woe to you who long for the Day of the LORD! </p><p class="indent"> What will the Day of the LORD be for you? </p><p class="indent"> It will be darkness and not light.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>It will be like a man who flees from a lion, </p><p class="indent"> only to encounter a bear, </p><p class="indent1"> or who enters his house and rests his hand against the wall, </p><p class="indent"> only to be bitten by a snake.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Will not the Day of the LORD </p><p class="indent"> be darkness and not light, </p><p class="indent"> even gloom with no brightness in it?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>“I hate, I despise your feasts! </p><p class="indent"> I cannot stand the stench of your solemn assemblies.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Even though you offer Me burnt offerings and grain offerings, </p><p class="indent"> I will not accept them; </p><p class="indent1"> for your peace offerings of fattened cattle </p><p class="indent"> I will have no regard.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Take away from Me the noise of your songs! </p><p class="indent"> I will not listen to the music of your harps.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>But let justice roll on like a river, </p><p class="indent"> and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>Did you bring Me sacrifices and offerings </p><p class="indent"> forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>You have taken along Sakkuth your king </p><p class="indent"> and Kaiwan your star god,<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> the idols you made for yourselves.
