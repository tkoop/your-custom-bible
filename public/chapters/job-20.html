</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“So my anxious thoughts compel me to answer, </p><p class="indent"> because of the turmoil within me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>I have heard a rebuke that insults me, </p><p class="indent"> and my understanding prompts a reply.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Do you not know that from antiquity, </p><p class="indent"> since man was placed on the earth,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>the triumph of the wicked has been brief </p><p class="indent"> and the joy of the godless momentary?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Though his arrogance reaches the heavens, </p><p class="indent"> and his head touches the clouds,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>he will perish forever, like his own dung; </p><p class="indent"> those who had seen him will ask, ‘Where is he?’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>He will fly away like a dream, never to be found; </p><p class="indent"> he will be chased away like a vision in the night.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The eye that saw him will see him no more, </p><p class="indent"> and his place will no longer behold him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>His sons will seek the <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> of the poor, </p><p class="indent"> for his own hands must return his wealth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The youthful <span class='spell ca'>vigour</span><span class='spell gb'>vigour</span><span class='spell us'>vigor</span> that fills his bones </p><p class="indent"> will lie down with him in the dust.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>Though evil is sweet in his mouth </p><p class="indent"> and he conceals it under his tongue,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>though he cannot bear to let it go </p><p class="indent"> and keeps it in his mouth,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>yet in his stomach his food sours </p><p class="indent"> into the venom of cobras within him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>He swallows wealth but vomits it out; </p><p class="indent"> God will force it from his stomach.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>He will suck the poison of cobras; </p><p class="indent"> the fangs of a viper will kill him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>He will not enjoy the streams, </p><p class="indent"> the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>He must return the fruit of his <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> without consuming it; </p><p class="indent"> he cannot enjoy the profits of his trading.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; </p><p class="indent"> he has seized houses he did not build.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Because his appetite is never satisfied, </p><p class="indent"> he cannot escape with his treasure.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Nothing is left for him to consume; </p><p class="indent"> thus his prosperity will not endure.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>In the midst of his plenty, he will be distressed; </p><p class="indent"> the full force of misery will come upon him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When he has filled his stomach, </p><p class="indent"> God will vent <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> fury upon him, </p><p class="indent"> raining it down on him as he eats.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Though he flees from an iron weapon, </p><p class="indent"> a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>It is drawn out of his back, </p><p class="indent"> the gleaming point from his liver.<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> Terrors come over him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. </p><p class="indent"> A fire unfanned will consume him </p><p class="indent"> and devour what is left in his tent.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>The heavens will expose his iniquity, </p><p class="indent"> and the earth will rise up against him.
