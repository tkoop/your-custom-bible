<font >Then Jesus began to speak to them in
parables: <font color="#a80000">“A man planted a vineyard. He put a
wall around it, dug a wine vat, and built a watchtower. Then he
rented it out to some tenants and went away on a journey.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >At harvest time, he
sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of
the vineyard. But they seized the servant, beat him, and sent him
away empty-handed. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Then he sent them
another servant, and they struck him over the head and treated him
shamefully. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >He sent still
another, and this one they killed. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >He sent many others;
some they beat and others they killed. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Finally, having one
beloved son, he sent him to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he
said. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But the tenants said
to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the
inheritance will be ours.’ So they seized the son, killed him, and
threw him out of the vineyard. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >What then will the
owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants, and
will give the vineyard to others. Have you never read this Scripture:

<font color="#a80000">‘<font >The stone the
builders rejected </font></font>

in our eyes’?” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, the leaders sought to arrest
Jesus, for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them.
But fearing the crowd, they left Him and went away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Later, they sent some of the Pharisees and
Herodians to catch Jesus in His words. “Teacher,” they said, “we
know that You are honest and seek favor from no one. Indeed, You are
impartial and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is
it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or not?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and
said, <font color="#a80000">“Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a
denarius to inspect.”</font> So they brought it, and He asked them,
<font color="#a80000">“Whose image is this? And whose inscription?”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Caesar’s,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“Give
to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And they marveled at Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Sadducees, who say there is no
resurrection, came to Jesus and questioned Him: “Teacher, Moses
wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no
children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up
offspring for him. Now there were seven brothers. The first one
married and died, leaving no children. Then the second one married
the widow, but he also died and left no children. And the third did
likewise. In this way, none of the seven left any children. And last
of all, the woman died. In the resurrection, then, whose wife will
she be? For all seven were married to her.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Aren’t
you mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of
God? When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in
marriage. Instead, they will be like the angels in heaven.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But concerning the
dead rising, have you not read about the burning bush in the Book of
Moses, how God told him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead, but of
the living. You are badly mistaken!” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now one of the scribes had come up and
heard their debate. Noticing how well Jesus had answered them, he
asked Him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“This
is the most important: ‘Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord
is One. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your
soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second
is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ No other commandment
is greater than these.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Right, Teacher,” the scribe replied.
“You have stated correctly that God is One and there is no other
but Him, and to love Him with all your heart and with all your
understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor
as yourself, which is more important than all burnt offerings and
sacrifices.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus saw that the man had answered
wisely, He said, <font color="#a80000">“You are not far from the
kingdom of God.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And no one dared to question Him any
further. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Jesus was teaching in the temple
courts, He asked, <font color="#a80000">“How can the scribes say
that the Christ is the Son of David? Speaking by the Holy Spirit,
David himself declared:</font> </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >The Lord said to
my Lord, </font></font>

<font color="#a80000">“<font >Sit at My right
hand </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >until I put Your
enemies </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >under Your feet.”</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >’
</font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >David himself calls
Him ‘Lord.’ So how can He be David’s son?” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the large crowd listened to Him with
delight. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In His teaching Jesus also said, <font color="#a80000">“Watch
out for the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, to
receive greetings in the marketplaces, and to have the chief seats in
the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. They defraud
widows of their houses, and for a show make lengthy prayers. These
men will receive greater condemnation.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Jesus was sitting opposite the
treasury, He watched the crowd putting money into it. And many rich
people put in large amounts. Then one poor widow came and put in two
small copper coins, which amounted to a small fraction of a denarius.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus called His disciples to Him and
said, <font color="#a80000">“Truly I tell you, this poor widow has
put more than all the others into the treasury. For they all
contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put
in all she had to live on.”</font> </font>
