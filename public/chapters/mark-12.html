resurrection, came to Jesus and questioned Him: “Teacher, Moses
wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no
children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up
offspring for him. Now there were seven brothers. The first one
married and died, leaving no children. Then the second one married
the widow, but he also died and left no children. And the third did
likewise. In this way, none of the seven left any children. And last
of all, the woman died. In the resurrection, then, whose wife will
she be? For all seven were married to her.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Aren’t
you mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of

dead rising, have you not read about the burning bush in the Book of

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now one of the scribes had come up and
heard their debate. Noticing how well Jesus had answered them, he
asked Him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” </font>

is the most important: ‘Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord

is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ No other commandment
is greater than these.”</font> </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Right, Teacher,” the scribe replied.
“You have stated correctly that God is One and there is no other
but Him, and to love Him with all your heart and with all your
understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor
as yourself, which is more important than all burnt offerings and
sacrifices.” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">In His teaching Jesus also said, <font color="#a80000">“Watch
out for the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, to

widows of their houses, and for a show make lengthy prayers. These
men will receive greater condemnation.”</font> </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">As Jesus was sitting opposite the
