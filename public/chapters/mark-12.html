</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">2</span>At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But they seized the servant, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then he sent them another servant, and they struck him over the head and treated him shamefully.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">5</span>He sent still another, and this one they killed. </p><p class="calibre3"> He sent many others; some they beat and others they killed.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">6</span>Finally, having one beloved son, he sent him to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">7</span>But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
<span class="reftext">8</span>So they seized the son, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">9</span>What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants, and will give the vineyard to others.

<span class="reftext">20</span>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died, leaving no children.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Then the second one married the widow, but he also died and left no children. And the third did likewise.
<span class="reftext">22</span>In this way, none of the seven left any children. And last of all, the woman died.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“Aren’t <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> mistaken, because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not know the <span class='cap'>Scriptures</span><span class='nocap'>scriptures</span> or the power of God?
<span class="reftext">25</span>When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. Instead, they will be like the angels in heaven.</span>
