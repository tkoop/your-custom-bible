<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Wicked Tenants<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 21:33–46; Luke 20:9–18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables: <span>“A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a wine vat, and built a watchtower. Then he rented it out to some tenants and went away on a journey.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">2</span>At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But they seized the servant, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then he sent them another servant, and they struck him over the head and treated him shamefully.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">5</span>He sent still another, and this one they killed. </p><p class="calibre3"> He sent many others; some they beat and others they killed.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">6</span>Finally, having one beloved son, he sent him to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">7</span>But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
<span class="reftext">8</span>So they seized the son, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">9</span>What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants, and will give the vineyard to others.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Have you never read this Scripture: </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘The stone the builders rejected </p><p class="indentred"> has become the cornerstone.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">11</span>This is from the Lord, </p><p class="indentred"> and it is marvellous in our eyes’<span class="fn">a</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>At this, the leaders sought<span class="fn">b</span>  to arrest Jesus, for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them. But fearing the crowd, they left Him and went away.
</p><p class="hdg">Paying Taxes to Caesar<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 22:15–22; Luke 20:19–26)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Later, they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to catch Jesus in His words.
<span class="reftext">14</span>“Teacher,” they said, “we know that You are honest and seek favour from no one. Indeed, You are impartial and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or not?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>But Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said, <span>“Why are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius<span class="fn">c</span>  to inspect.”</span>
<span class="reftext">16</span>So they brought it, and He asked them, <span>“Whose image is this? And whose inscription?”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“Caesar’s,” they answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then Jesus told them, <span>“Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> And they marvelled at Him.
</p><p class="hdg">The Sadducees and the Resurrection<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 22:23–33; Luke 20:27–40)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and questioned Him:
<span class="reftext">19</span>“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up offspring for him.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died, leaving no children.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Then the second one married the widow, but he also died and left no children. And the third did likewise.
<span class="reftext">22</span>In this way, none of the seven left any children. And last of all, the woman died.
<span class="reftext">23</span>In the resurrection, then,<span class="fn">e</span>  whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“Aren’t you mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?
<span class="reftext">25</span>When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. Instead, they will be like the angels in heaven.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">26</span>But concerning the dead rising, have you not read about the burning bush in the Book of Moses, how God told him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’<span class="fn">f</span>?
<span class="reftext">27</span>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”
</p><p class="hdg">The Greatest Commandment<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 6:1–19; Matthew 22:34–40)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Now one of the scribes had come up and heard their debate. Noticing how well Jesus had answered them, he asked Him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Jesus replied, <span>“This is the most important: ‘Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’<span class="fn">g</span> 
<span class="reftext">31</span>The second is this: ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’<span class="fn">h</span>  No other commandment is greater than these.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>“Right, Teacher,” the scribe replied. “You have stated correctly that God is One and there is no other but Him,
<span class="reftext">33</span>and to love Him with all your heart and with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself, which is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>When Jesus saw that the man had answered wisely, He said, <span>“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> And no one dared to question Him any further.
</p><p class="hdg">Whose Son Is the Christ?<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 22:41–46; Luke 20:41–44)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts,<span class="fn">i</span>  He asked, <span>“How can the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?
<span class="reftext">36</span>Speaking by the Holy Spirit, David himself declared:</span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘The Lord said to my Lord, </p><p class="indentred">“Sit at My right hand </p><p class="indentred1"> until I put Your enemies </p><p class="indentred"> under Your feet.”<span class="thinq"> </span>’<span class="fn">j</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">37</span>David himself calls Him ‘Lord.’ So how can He be David’s son?” </p><p class="reg1"> And the large crowd listened to Him with delight.
</p><p class="hdg">Beware of the Scribes<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 20:45–47)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>In His teaching Jesus also said, <span>“Watch out for the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, to receive greetings in the marketplaces,
<span class="reftext">39</span>and to have the chief seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets.
<span class="reftext">40</span>They defraud widows of their houses,<span class="fn">k</span>  and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater condemnation.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Widow’s Offering<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 21:1–4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>As Jesus was sitting opposite the treasury, He watched the crowd putting money into it. And many rich people put in large amounts.
<span class="reftext">42</span>Then one poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which amounted to a small fraction of a denarius.<span class="fn">l</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, <span>“Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more than all the others into the treasury.
<span class="reftext">44</span>For they all contributed out of their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to live on.”</span></p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Psalm 118:22–23<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">they sought</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> A denarius was customarily a day’s wage for a labourer; see Matthew 20:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Deuteronomy 25:5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">In the resurrection, when they rise,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Exodus 3:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Deuteronomy 6:4–5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Leviticus 19:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Psalm 110:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">40</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">They devour widows’ houses</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">42</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">put in two lepta, which is a kodrantēs</i>; a lepton was a Jewish coin of bronze or copper worth about 1-128 of a denarius.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
