The authorities that exist have been appointed by God.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Consequently, whoever resists authority is opposing what God has set in place, and those who do so will bring <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> on themselves.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Do you want to be unafraid of the one in authority? Then do what is right, and you will have his approval.
<span class="reftext">4</span>For he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not carry the sword in vain. He is God’s servant, an agent of retribution to the wrongdoer.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Therefore it is necessary to submit to authority, not only to avoid punishment, but also as a matter of conscience.
<span class="reftext">6</span>This is also why you pay taxes. For the authorities are God’s servants, who devote themselves to their work.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Pay everyone what you owe him: taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> to whom <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> is due.
</p><p class="hdg">Love Fulfills the Law<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Leviticus 19:9–18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Be indebted to no one, except to one another in love. For he who loves his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> has fulfilled the law.
<span class="reftext">9</span>The commandments “Do not commit adultery,” “Do not murder,” “Do not steal,” “Do not covet,”<span class="fn">a</span>  and any other commandments, are summed up in this one decree: “Love your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> as yourself.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Love does no wrong to its <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>. Therefore love is the <span class='spell ca'>fulfillment</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfilment</span><span class='spell us'>fulfillment</span> of the law.
</p><p class="hdg">The Day Is Near</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And do this, understanding the occasion. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
<span class="reftext">12</span>The night is nearly over; the day has drawn near. So let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the <span class='spell ca'>armour</span><span class='spell gb'>armour</span><span class='spell us'>armor</span> of light.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Instead, clothe yourselves with<span class="fn">c</span>  the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the desires of the flesh.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Exodus 20:13–17; Deuteronomy 5:17–21<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Leviticus 19:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">put on</i>; see verse 12.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
