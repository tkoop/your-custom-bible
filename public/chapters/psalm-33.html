</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Praise the LORD with the harp; </p><p class="indent"> make music to Him with ten strings.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Sing to Him a new song; </p><p class="indent"> play skillfully with a shout of joy.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>For the word of the LORD is upright, </p><p class="indent"> and all His work is trustworthy.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The LORD loves righteousness and justice; </p><p class="indent"> the earth is full of His loving devotion.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, </p><p class="indent"> and all the stars by the breath of His mouth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>He piles up the waters of the sea; </p><p class="indent"> He puts the depths into storehouses.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Let all the earth fear the LORD; </p><p class="indent"> let all the people of the world revere Him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>For He spoke, and it came to be; </p><p class="indent"> He commanded, and it stood firm.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations; </p><p class="indent"> He thwarts the devices of the peoples.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The counsel of the LORD stands forever, </p><p class="indent"> the purposes of His heart to all generations.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> the people He has chosen as His inheritance!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>The LORD looks down from heaven; </p><p class="indent"> He sees all the sons of men.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>From His dwelling place He gazes </p><p class="indent"> on all who inhabit the earth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>He shapes the hearts of each; </p><p class="indent"> He considers all their works.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>No king is saved by his vast army; </p><p class="indent"> no warrior is delivered by his great strength.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>A horse is a vain hope for salvation; </p><p class="indent"> even its great strength cannot save.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>Surely the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear Him, </p><p class="indent"> on those whose hope is in His loving devotion
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>to deliver them from death </p><p class="indent"> and keep them alive in famine.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Our soul waits for the LORD; </p><p class="indent"> He is our help and our shield.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>For our hearts rejoice in Him, </p><p class="indent"> since we trust in His holy name.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>May Your loving devotion rest on us, O LORD, </p><p class="indent"> as we put our hope in You.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
