<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Samson’s Revenge</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Later on, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. “I want to go to my wife in her room,” he said. But her father would not let him enter.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“I was sure that you thoroughly hated her,” said her father, “so I gave her to one of the men who accompanied you. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless in doing harm to the Philistines.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes. And he took torches, turned the foxes tail-to-tail, and fastened a torch between each pair of tails.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then he lit the torches and released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines, burning up the piles of grain and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>“Who did this?” the Philistines demanded. </p><p class="reg1">“It was Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite,” they were told. “For his wife was given to his companion.” </p><p class="reg1"> So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>And Samson told them, “Because you have done this, I will not rest until I have taken vengeance upon you.”
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he struck them ruthlessly<span class="fn">a</span>  with a great slaughter, and then went down and stayed in the cave at the rock of Etam.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then the Philistines went up, camped in Judah, and deployed themselves near the town of Lehi.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>“Why have you attacked us?” said the men of Judah. </p><p class="reg1"> The Philistines replied, “We have come to arrest Samson and pay him back for what he has done to us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>In response, three thousand men of Judah went to the cave at the rock of Etam, and they asked Samson, “Do you not <span class='spell ca'>realize</span><span class='spell gb'>realise</span><span class='spell us'>realize</span> that the Philistines rule over us? What have you done to us?” </p><p class="reg1">“I have done to them what they did to me,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But they said to him, “We have come down to arrest you and hand you over to the Philistines.” </p><p class="reg1"> Samson replied, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>“No,” they answered, “we will not kill you, but we will tie you up securely and hand you over to them.” So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When Samson arrived in Lehi, the Philistines came out shouting against him. And the Spirit of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came mightily upon him. The ropes on his arms became like burnt flax, and the bonds broke loose from his hands.
<span class="reftext">15</span>He found the fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and struck down a thousand men.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Then Samson said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“With the jawbone of a donkey </p><p class="indent"> I have piled them into heaps.<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> With the jawbone of a donkey </p><p class="indent"> I have slain a thousand men.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>And when Samson had finished speaking, he cast the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And being very thirsty, Samson cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “You have accomplished this great deliverance through Your servant. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned, and he was revived. That is why he named it En-hakkore,<span class="fn">e</span>  and it remains in Lehi to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Samson judged Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">he struck them hip and thigh</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">and spread out in Lehi</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">I have made them into donkeys</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Ramath-lehi</i> means <i class="calibre6">the hill of the jawbone</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">En-hakkore</i> means <i class="calibre6">the spring of him who calls</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
