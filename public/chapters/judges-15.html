<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Samson’s Revenge</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Later on, at the time of the wheat
harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. “I
want to go to my wife in her room,” he said. But her father would
not let him enter. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I was sure that you thoroughly hated
her,” said her father, “so I gave her to one of the men who
accompanied you. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she?
Please take her instead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Samson said to them, “This time I will
be blameless in doing harm to the Philistines.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Samson went out and caught three
hundred foxes. And he took torches, turned the foxes tail-to-tail,
and fastened a torch between each pair of tails. Then he lit the
torches and released the foxes into the standing grain of the
Philistines, burning up the piles of grain and the standing grain, as
well as the vineyards and olive groves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Who did this?” the Philistines
demanded. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">It was Samson, the son-in-law of the
Timnite,” they were told. “For his wife was given to his
companion.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the Philistines went up and burned her
and her father to death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Samson told them, “Because you have
done this, I will not rest until I have taken vengeance upon you.”
And he struck them ruthlessly with a great slaughter, and then went
down and stayed in the cave at the rock of Etam. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Philistines went up, camped in
Judah, and deployed themselves near the town of Lehi. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Why have you attacked us?” said the
men of Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Philistines replied, “We have come
to arrest Samson and pay him back for what he has done to us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In response, three thousand men of Judah
went to the cave at the rock of Etam, and they asked Samson, “Do
you not realize that the Philistines rule over us? What have you done
to us?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I have done to them what they did to
me,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But they said to him, “We have come down
to arrest you and hand you over to the Philistines.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Samson replied, “Swear to me that you
will not kill me yourselves.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">No,” they answered, “we will not
kill you, but we will tie you up securely and hand you over to them.”
So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Samson arrived in Lehi, the
Philistines came out shouting against him. And the Spirit of the LORD
came mightily upon him. The ropes on his arms became like burnt flax,
and the bonds broke loose from his hands. He found the fresh jawbone
of a donkey, reached out his hand and took it, and struck down a
thousand men. Then Samson said: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">With the jawbone of a donkey </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I have piled them into heaps. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">With the jawbone of a donkey </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I have slain a thousand men.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when Samson had finished speaking, he
cast the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And being very thirsty, Samson cried out
to the LORD, “You have accomplished this great deliverance through
Your servant. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the
uncircumcised?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So God opened up the hollow place in Lehi,
and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned,
and he was revived. That is why he named it En-hakkore, and it
remains in Lehi to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Samson judged Israel for twenty years
in the days of the Philistines. </font>
