<span class="reftext">2</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Do not learn the ways of the nations </p><p class="indent"> or be terrified by the signs in the heavens, </p><p class="indent"> though the nations themselves are terrified by them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For the customs of the peoples are worthless; </p><p class="indent"> they cut down a tree from the forest; </p><p class="indent1"> it is shaped with a chisel </p><p class="indent"> by the hands of a craftsman.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>They adorn it with silver and gold </p><p class="indent"> and fasten it with hammer and nails, </p><p class="indent"> so that it will not totter.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Like scarecrows in a cucumber patch, </p><p class="indent"> their idols cannot speak. </p><p class="indent1"> They must be carried </p><p class="indent"> because they cannot walk. </p><p class="indent1"> Do not fear them, for they can do no harm, </p><p class="indent"> and neither can they do any good.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>There is none like You, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>. </p><p class="indent"> You are great, and Your name is mighty in power.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Who would not fear You, O King of nations? </p><p class="indent"> This is Your due. </p><p class="indent1"> For among all the wise men of the nations, </p><p class="indent"> and in all their kingdoms, </p><p class="indent"> there is none like You.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>But they are altogether senseless and foolish, </p><p class="indent"> instructed by worthless idols made of wood!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish, </p><p class="indent"> and gold from Uphaz—</p><p class="indent1"> the work of a craftsman </p><p class="indent"> from the hands of a goldsmith. </p><p class="indent1"> Their clothes are blue and purple, </p><p class="indent"> all fashioned by skilled workers.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is the true God; </p><p class="indent"> He is the living God and eternal King. </p><p class="indent1"> The earth quakes at His wrath, </p><p class="indent"> and the nations cannot endure His indignation.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Thus you are to tell them: “These gods, who have made neither the heavens nor the earth, will perish from this earth and from under these heavens.”<span class="fn">a</span>

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>When He thunders, </p><p class="indent"> the waters in the heavens roar; </p><p class="indent1"> He causes the clouds to rise </p><p class="indent"> from the ends of the earth. </p><p class="indent1"> He generates the lightning with the rain </p><p class="indent"> and brings forth the wind from His storehouses.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>Every man is senseless and devoid of knowledge; </p><p class="indent"> every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols. </p><p class="indent1"> For his molten images are a fraud, </p><p class="indent"> and there is no breath in them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>They are worthless, a work to be mocked. </p><p class="indent"> In the time of their punishment they will perish.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>The Portion of Jacob is not like these, </p><p class="indent"> for He is the Maker of all things, </p><p class="indent1"> and Israel is the tribe of His inheritance—</p><p class="indent"> <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts is His name.
