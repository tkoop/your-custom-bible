<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Israel Rebuked at Bochim</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now the angel<span class="fn">a</span>  of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> went up from Gilgal to Bochim and said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land that I had promised to your fathers, and I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you,
<span class="reftext">2</span>and you are not to make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall tear down their altars.’ </p><p class="reg1"> Yet you have not obeyed My voice. What is this you have done?
<span class="reftext">3</span>So now I tell you that I will not drive out these people before you; they will be thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had spoken these words to all the Israelites, the people lifted up their voices and wept.
<span class="reftext">5</span>So they called that place Bochim<span class="fn">b</span>  and offered sacrifices there to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="hdg">Joshua’s Death and Burial<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Joshua 24:29–33)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>After Joshua had dismissed the people, the Israelites went out to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the people served <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> throughout the days of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him, who had seen all the great works that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had done for Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And Joshua son of Nun, the servant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, died at the age of 110.
<span class="reftext">9</span>They buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath-heres<span class="fn">c</span>  in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
</p><p class="hdg">Israel’s Unfaithfulness<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 43:22–28; Jeremiah 2:23–37)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>After that whole generation had also been gathered to their fathers, another generation rose up who did not know <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> or the works that He had done for Israel.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the Israelites did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and served the Baals.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Thus they forsook <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they followed after various gods of the peoples around them. They bowed down to them and provoked <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to anger,
<span class="reftext">13</span>for they forsook Him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of those who plundered them.<span class="fn">d</span>  He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Wherever Israel marched out, the hand of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was against them to bring calamity, just as He had sworn to them. So they were greatly distressed.
</p><p class="hdg">Judges Raised Up</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> raised up judges,<span class="fn">e</span>  who saved them from the hands of those who plundered them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Israel, however, did not listen to their judges. Instead, they prostituted themselves with other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned from the way of their fathers, who had walked in obedience to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s commandments; they did not do as their fathers had done.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Whenever <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> raised up a judge for the Israelites, He was with that judge and saved them from the hands of their enemies while the judge was still alive; for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was moved to pity by their groaning under those who oppressed them and afflicted them.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But when the judge died, the Israelites became even more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods to serve them and bow down to them. They would not give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against Israel, and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed the covenant I laid down for their fathers and has not heeded My voice,
<span class="reftext">21</span>I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.
<span class="reftext">22</span>In this way I will test whether Israel will keep the way of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> by walking in it as their fathers did.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>That is why <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had left those nations in place and had not driven them out immediately by delivering them into the hand of Joshua.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i>; also in verse 4<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Bochim</i> means <i class="calibre6">weepers</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Timnath-heres</i> is also known as <i class="calibre6">Timnath-serah</i>; see Joshua 19:50 and Joshua 24:30.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">of plunderers who plundered them</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">governors</i> or <i class="calibre6">leaders</i>; here and throughout the book of Judges<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
