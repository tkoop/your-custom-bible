<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a><span class="reftext">11</span>And the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Thus they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they followed after various gods of the peoples around them. They bowed down to them and provoked the LORD to anger,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a><span class="reftext">13</span>for they forsook Him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of those who plundered them.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">d</a></span>  He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a><span class="reftext">15</span>Wherever Israel marched out, the hand of the LORD was against them to bring calamity, just as He had sworn to them. So they were greatly distressed.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Israel, however, did not listen to their judges. Instead, they prostituted themselves with other gods and bowed down to them. They quickly turned from the way of their fathers, who had walked in obedience to the LORD’s commandments; they did not do as their fathers had done.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for the Israelites, He was with that judge and saved them from the hands of their enemies while the judge was still alive; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning under those who oppressed them and afflicted them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a><span class="reftext">19</span>But when the judge died, the Israelites became even more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods to serve them and bow down to them. They would not give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed the covenant I laid down for their fathers and has not heeded My voice,
