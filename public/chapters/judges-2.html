<font ><b>Judges Raised Up</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the angel of the LORD went up from
Gilgal to Bochim and said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led
you into the land that I had promised to your fathers, and I said, ‘I
will never break My covenant with you, and you are not to make a
covenant with the people of this land, but you shall tear down their
altars.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet you have not obeyed My voice. What is
this you have done? So now I tell you that I will not drive out these
people before you; they will be thorns in your sides, and their gods
will be a snare to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the angel of the LORD had spoken
these words to all the Israelites, the people lifted up their voices
and wept. So they called that place Bochim and offered sacrifices
there to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Joshua had dismissed the people, the
Israelites went out to take possession of the land, each to his own
inheritance. And the people served the LORD throughout the days of
Joshua and of the elders who outlived him, who had seen all the great
works that the LORD had done for Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the
LORD, died at the age of 110. They buried him in the land of his
inheritance, at Timnath-heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north
of Mount Gaash. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After that whole generation had also been
gathered to their fathers, another generation rose up who did not
know the LORD or the works that He had done for Israel. And the
Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus they forsook the LORD, the God of
their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and
they followed after various gods of the peoples around them. They
bowed down to them and provoked the LORD to anger, for they forsook
Him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the anger of the LORD burned against
Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of those who plundered
them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom
they were no longer able to resist. Wherever Israel marched out, the
hand of the LORD was against them to bring calamity, just as He had
sworn to them. So they were greatly distressed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved
them from the hands of those who plundered them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Israel, however, did not listen to their
judges. Instead, they prostituted themselves with other gods and
bowed down to them. They quickly turned from the way of their
fathers, who had walked in obedience to the LORD’s commandments;
they did not do as their fathers had done. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for
the Israelites, He was with that judge and saved them from the hands
of their enemies while the judge was still alive; for the LORD was
moved to pity by their groaning under those who oppressed them and
afflicted them. But when the judge died, the Israelites became even
more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods to serve them
and bow down to them. They would not give up their evil practices and
stubborn ways. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the anger of the LORD burned against
Israel, and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed the
covenant I laid down for their fathers and has not heeded My voice, I
will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left
when he died. In this way I will test whether Israel will keep the
way of the LORD by walking in it as their fathers did.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That is why the LORD had left those
nations in place and had not driven them out immediately by
delivering them into the hand of Joshua. </font>
