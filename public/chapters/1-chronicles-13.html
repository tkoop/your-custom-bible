<font ><b>David Fetches the Ark</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David conferred with all his leaders,
the commanders of hundreds and of thousands. And he said to the whole
assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if this is of the
LORD our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our
brothers in all the land of Israel, and also to the priests and
Levites in their cities and pasturelands, so that they may join us.
Then let us bring back the ark of our God, for we did not inquire of
Him in the days of Saul.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And because this proposal seemed right to
all the people, the whole assembly agreed to it. So David assembled
all Israel, from the River Shihor in Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring
the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David and all Israel went up to Baalah of
Judah (that is, Kiriath-jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God
the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubim—the ark that is
called by the Name. So they carried the ark of God from the house of
Abinadab on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding the cart. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David and all the Israelites were
celebrating before God with all their might, with songs and on harps
and lyres, with tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they came to the threshing floor of
Chidon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark, because the oxen
had stumbled. And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and He
struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died
there before God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David became angry because the LORD
had burst forth against Uzzah; so he named that place Perez-uzzah, as
it is called to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That day David feared God and asked, “How
can I ever bring the ark of God to me?” So he did not move the ark
with him to the City of David; instead, he took it aside to the house
of Obed-edom the Gittite. Thus the ark of God remained with the
family of Obed-edom in his house for three months, and the LORD
blessed his household and everything he owned. </font>
