<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">David Fetches the Ark<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Samuel 6:1–4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then David conferred with all his leaders, the commanders of hundreds and of thousands.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And he said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if this is of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our brothers in all the land of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites in their cities and pasturelands, so that they may join us.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then let us bring back the ark of our God, for we did not inquire of <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class="fn">a</span>  in the days of Saul.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And because this proposal seemed right to all the people, the whole assembly agreed to it.
<span class="reftext">5</span>So David assembled all Israel, from the River Shihor<span class="fn">b</span>  in Egypt to Lebo-hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>David and all Israel went up to Baalah of Judah (that is, Kiriath-jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, who is enthroned between the cherubim—the ark that is called by the <span class='cap'>Name</span><span class='nocap'>name</span>.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">7</span>So they carried the ark of God from the house of Abinadab on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding the cart.
</p><p class="hdg">Uzzah Touches the Ark<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Samuel 6:5–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>David and all the Israelites were celebrating before God with all their might, with songs and on harps and lyres, with tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>When they came to the threshing floor of Chidon,<span class="fn">d</span>  Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark, because the oxen had stumbled.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against Uzzah, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then David became angry because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had burst forth against Uzzah; so he named that place Perez-uzzah,<span class="fn">e</span>  as it is called to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>That day David feared God and asked, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?”
<span class="reftext">13</span>So he did not move the ark with him to the <span class='cap'>City</span><span class='nocap'>city</span> of David; instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Thus the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house for three months, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> blessed his household and everything he owned.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">of it</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">from the Shihor</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the ark of God, which is called by the Name of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> who is enthroned between the cherubim</i>; or <i class="calibre6">the ark of God, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, who is enthroned between the cherubim, where His Name is called</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Chidon</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Nacon</i>; see 2 Samuel 6:6.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Perez-uzzah</i> means <i class="calibre6">outbreak against Uzzah</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
