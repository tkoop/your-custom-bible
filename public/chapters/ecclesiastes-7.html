<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Value of Wisdom</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>A good name is better than fine perfume, </p><p class="indent"> and one’s day of death is better than his day of birth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>It is better to enter a house of mourning </p><p class="indent"> than a house of feasting, </p><p class="indent1"> since death is the end of every man, </p><p class="indent"> and the living should take this to heart.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>Sorrow is better than laughter, </p><p class="indent"> for a sad countenance is good for the heart.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, </p><p class="indent"> but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>It is better to heed a wise man’s rebuke </p><p class="indent"> than to listen to the song of fools.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For like the crackling of thorns under the pot, </p><p class="indent"> so is the laughter of the fool. This too is futile.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>Surely extortion turns a wise man into a fool, </p><p class="indent"> and a bribe corrupts the heart.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>The end of a matter is better than the beginning, </p><p class="indent"> and a patient spirit is better than a proud one.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, </p><p class="indent"> for anger settles in the lap of a fool.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?” </p><p class="indent"> For it is unwise of you to ask about this.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>Wisdom, like an inheritance, is good, </p><p class="indent"> and it benefits those who see the sun.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>For wisdom, like money, is a shelter, </p><p class="indent"> and the advantage of knowledge </p><p class="indent"> is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Consider the work of God: </p><p class="indent"> Who can straighten what <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has bent?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>In the day of prosperity, be joyful, </p><p class="indent"> but in the day of adversity, consider this: </p><p class="indent1"> God has made one of these along with the other, </p><p class="indent"> so that a man cannot discover </p><p class="indent"> anything that will come after him.
</p><p class="hdg">The Limits of Human Wisdom</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>In my futile life I have seen both of these: </p><p class="list1stline"> A righteous man perishing in his righteousness, </p><p class="list1stline"> and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Do not be overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?
<span class="reftext">17</span>Do not be excessively wicked, and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time?
<span class="reftext">18</span>It is good to grasp the one and not let the other slip from your hand. For he who fears God will follow both warnings.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>Wisdom makes the wise man </p><p class="indent"> stronger than ten rulers in a city.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Surely there is no righteous man on earth </p><p class="indent"> who does good and never sins.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Do not pay attention to every word that is spoken, or you may hear your servant cursing you.
<span class="reftext">22</span>For you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>All this I tested by wisdom, saying, “I resolve to be wise.” But it was beyond me.
<span class="reftext">24</span>What exists is out of reach and very deep. Who can fathom it?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>I directed my mind to understand, to explore, to search out wisdom and explanations, and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the folly of madness.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a net, and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is ensnared.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>“Behold,” says the <span class='cap'>Teacher</span><span class='nocap'>teacher</span>, “I have discovered this by adding one thing to another to find an explanation.
<span class="reftext">28</span>While my soul was still searching but not finding, among a thousand I have found one upright man, but among all these I have not found one such woman.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Only this have I found: I have discovered that God made men upright, but they have sought out many schemes.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">in the bosom of fools</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">will avoid all extremes</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
