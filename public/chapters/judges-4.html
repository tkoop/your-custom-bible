<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Ehud died, the Israelites again did
evil in the sight of the LORD. So the LORD sold them into the hand of
Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his
forces was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim. Then the
Israelites cried out to the LORD, because Jabin had nine hundred
chariots of iron, and he had harshly oppressed the Israelites for
twenty years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of
Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. And she would sit under
the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of
Ephraim, where the Israelites would go up to her for judgment. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >She summoned Barak son of Abinoam from
Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “Surely the LORD, the God of
Israel, is commanding you: ‘Go and march to Mount Tabor, taking
with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun. And I will draw
out Sisera the commander of Jabin’s army, his chariots, and his
troops to the River Kishon, and I will deliver him into your hand.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Barak said to her, “If you will go with
me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I will certainly go with you,”
Deborah replied, “but the road you are taking will bring you no
honor, because the LORD will be selling Sisera into the hand of a
woman.” So Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh, where he
summoned Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand men followed him, and
Deborah also went with him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Heber the Kenite had moved away from
the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and
had pitched his tent by the great tree of Zaanannim, which was near
Kedesh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Sisera was told that Barak son of
Abinoam had gone up Mount Tabor, he summoned all nine hundred of his
iron chariots and all the men with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the
River Kishon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Deborah said to Barak, “Arise, for
this is the day that the LORD has delivered Sisera into your hand.
Has not the LORD gone before you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Barak came down from Mount Tabor with
ten thousand men following him. And in front of him the LORD routed
with the sword Sisera, all his charioteers, and all his army. Sisera
abandoned his chariot and fled on foot. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Barak pursued the chariots and army
as far as Harosheth-hagoyim, and the whole army of Sisera fell by the
sword; not a single man was left. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, Sisera had fled on foot to the
tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace
between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. Jael
went out to greet Sisera and said to him, “Come in, my lord. Come
in with me. Do not be afraid.” So he entered her tent, and she
covered him with a blanket. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Sisera said to her, “Please give me a
little water to drink, for I am thirsty.” So she opened a container
of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him again. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Stand at the entrance to the tent,”
he said, “and if anyone comes and asks you, ‘Is there a man
here?’ say, ‘No.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But as he lay sleeping from exhaustion,
Heber’s wife Jael took a tent peg, grabbed a hammer, and went
silently to Sisera. She drove the peg through his temple and into the
ground, and he died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera,
Jael went out to greet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show
you the man you are seeking.” So he went in with her, and there lay
Sisera dead, with a tent peg through his temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On that day God subdued Jabin king of
Canaan before the Israelites. And the hand of the Israelites grew
stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan until they
destroyed him. </font>
