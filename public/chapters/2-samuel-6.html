<span class="reftext">2</span>And he and all his troops set out for Baale of Judah<span class="fn">a</span>  to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name—<span class="fn">b</span>  the name of the LORD of Hosts, who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart,
<span class="reftext">4</span>bringing with it the ark of God.<span class="fn">c</span>  And Ahio was walking in front of the ark.
</p><p class="hdg">Uzzah Touches the Ark<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 13:8–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of wood instruments,<span class="fn">d</span>  harps, stringed instruments, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon,<span class="fn">e</span>  Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen had stumbled.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and God struck him down on the spot for his irreverence,<span class="fn">f</span>  and he died there beside the ark of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then David became angry because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah; so he named that place Perez-uzzah,<span class="fn">g</span>  as it is called to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>That day David feared the LORD and asked, “How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?”
<span class="reftext">10</span>So he was unwilling to move the ark of the LORD to the City of David; instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Thus the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed him and all his household.
</p><p class="hdg">The Ark Brought to Jerusalem<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 15:1–28)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Now it was reported to King David, “The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.” </p><p class="reg1"> So David went and had the ark of God brought up from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David with rejoicing.
<span class="reftext">13</span>When those carrying the ark of the LORD had advanced six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And David, wearing a linen ephod, danced with all his might before the LORD,
<span class="reftext">15</span>while he and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and the sounding of the ram’s horn.
</p><p class="hdg">Michal’s Contempt for David<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 15:29–16:3)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised him in her heart.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So they brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it. Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>When David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of Hosts.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Then he distributed to every man and woman among the multitude of Israel a loaf of bread, a date cake,<span class="fn">h</span>  and a raisin cake. And all the people departed, each for his own home.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>As soon as David returned home to bless his own household, Saul’s daughter Michal came out to meet him. “How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today!” she said. “He has uncovered himself today in the sight of the maidservants of his subjects, like a vulgar person would do.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>But David said to Michal, “I was dancing before the LORD, who chose me over your father and all his house when He appointed me ruler over the LORD’s people Israel. I will celebrate before the LORD,
<span class="reftext">22</span>and I will humiliate and humble myself even more than this. Yet I will be honoured by the maidservants of whom you have spoken.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>And Michal the daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, Kiriath-jearim; see 1 Chronicles 13:6.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew; LXX and Vulgate do not include <i class="calibre6">the Name—</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> DSS and some LXX manuscripts; MT includes <i class="calibre6">from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">before the LORD with all woods of cypress</i>; LXX <i class="calibre6">playing before the Lord on well-tuned instruments mightily, and with songs</i>; some of the instruments in this verse are uncertain; see 1 Chronicles 13:8.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Nacon</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Chidon</i>; see 1 Chronicles 13:9.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> MT; DSS <i class="calibre6">for this</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">Perez-uzzah</i> means <i class="calibre6">outbreak against Uzzah</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a portion of meat</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
