<font ><b>David Fetches the Ark</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David again assembled the chosen men of
Israel, thirty thousand in all. And he and all his troops set out for
Baale of Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called
by the Name— the name of the LORD of Hosts, who is enthroned
between the cherubim that are on it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They set the ark of God on a new cart and
brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah
and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart, bringing
with it the ark of God. And Ahio was walking in front of the ark. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David and all the house of Israel were
celebrating before the LORD with all kinds of wood instruments,
harps, stringed instruments, tambourines, sistrums, and cymbals. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they came to the threshing floor of
Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the
oxen had stumbled. And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah,
and God struck him down on the spot for his irreverence, and he died
there beside the ark of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David became angry because the LORD
had burst forth against Uzzah; so he named that place Perez-uzzah, as
it is called to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That day David feared the LORD and asked,
“How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?” So he was
unwilling to move the ark of the LORD to the City of David; instead,
he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. Thus the ark
of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three
months, and the LORD blessed him and all his household. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now it was reported to King David, “The
LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him,
because of the ark of God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David went and had the ark of God
brought up from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David with
rejoicing. When those carrying the ark of the LORD had advanced six
paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened calf. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David, wearing a linen ephod, danced
with all his might before the LORD, while he and all the house of
Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting and the sounding
of the ram’s horn. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the ark of the LORD was entering the
City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from a window and
saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, and she despised
him in her heart. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they brought the ark of the LORD and
set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it.
Then David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the
LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When David had finished sacrificing the
burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
name of the LORD of Hosts. Then he distributed to every man and woman
among the multitude of Israel a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a
raisin cake. And all the people departed, each for his own home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As soon as David returned home to bless
his own household, Saul’s daughter Michal came out to meet him.
“How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today!” she
said. “He has uncovered himself today in the sight of the
maidservants of his subjects, like a vulgar person would do.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But David said to Michal, “I was dancing
before the LORD, who chose me over your father and all his house when
He appointed me ruler over the LORD’s people Israel. I will
celebrate before the LORD, and I will humiliate and humble myself
even more than this. Yet I will be honored by the maidservants of
whom you have spoken.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Michal the daughter of Saul had no
children to the day of her death. </font>
