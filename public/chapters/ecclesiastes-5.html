<font ><b>Approaching God with Awe</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Guard your steps when you go to the house
of God. Draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of
fools, who do not know that they do wrong. Do not be quick to speak,
and do not be hasty in your heart to utter a word before God. After
all, God is in heaven and you are on earth. So let your words be few.
</font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >As a dream comes through many cares, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >so the speech of a fool comes with many
words. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When you make a vow to God, do not delay
in fulfilling it, because He takes no pleasure in fools. Fulfill your
vow. It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to
sin, and do not tell the messenger that your vow was a mistake. Why
should God be angry with your words and destroy the work of your
hands? For as many dreams bring futility, so do many words.
Therefore, fear God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If you see the oppression of the poor and
the denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be
astonished at the matter; for one official is watched by a superior,
and others higher still are over them. The produce of the earth is
taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He who loves money is never satisfied by
money, and he who loves wealth is never satisfied by income. This too
is futile. When good things increase, so do those who consume them;
what then is the profit to the owner, except to behold them with his
eyes? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The sleep of the worker is sweet, whether
he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich man permits him
no sleep. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There is a grievous evil I have seen under
the sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its owner, or wealth lost in a
failed venture, so when that man has a son there is nothing to pass
on. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As a man came from his mother’s womb, so
he will depart again, naked as he arrived. He takes nothing for his
labor to carry in his hands. This too is a grievous evil: Exactly as
a man is born, so he will depart. What does he gain as he toils for
the wind? Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness, with much
sorrow, sickness, and anger. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Here is what I have seen to be good and
fitting: to eat and drink, and to find satisfaction in all the labor
one does under the sun during the few days of life that God has given
him—for this is his lot. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Furthermore, God has given riches and
wealth to every man, and He has enabled him to enjoy them, to accept
his lot, and to rejoice in his labor. This is a gift from God. For a
man seldom considers the days of his life, because God keeps him
occupied with the joy of his heart. </font>
