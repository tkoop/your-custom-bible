<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Approaching God with Awe</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Do not be quick to speak, and do not be hasty in your heart to utter a word before God. After all, God is in <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> and you are on <span class='nocap'>Earth</span><span class='cap'>Earth</span><span class='bsb'>earth</span>. So let your words be few.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>As a dream comes through many cares, </p><p class="indent"> so the speech of a fool comes with many words.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it, because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> takes no pleasure in fools. <span class='spell ca'>Fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>Fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>Fulfill</span> your vow.
<span class="reftext">5</span>It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin, and do not tell the messenger<span class="fn">a</span>  that your vow was a mistake. Why should God be angry with your words and destroy the work of your hands?
<span class="reftext">7</span>For as many dreams bring futility, so do many words. Therefore, fear God.
</p><p class="hdg">The Futility of Wealth<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 49:1–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>If you see the oppression of the poor and the denial of justice and righteousness in the province, do not be astonished at the matter; for one official is watched by a superior, and others higher still are over them.
<span class="reftext">9</span>The produce of the earth is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>He who loves money is never satisfied by money, and he who loves wealth is never satisfied by income. This too is futile.
<span class="reftext">11</span>When good things increase, so do those who consume them; what then is the profit to the owner, except to behold them with his eyes?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>The sleep of the worker is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich man permits him no sleep.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>There is a grievous evil I have seen under the sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its owner,
<span class="reftext">14</span>or wealth lost in a failed venture, so when that man has a son there is nothing to pass on.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>As a man came from his mother’s womb, so he will depart again, naked as he arrived. He takes nothing for his <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> to carry in his hands.
<span class="reftext">16</span>This too is a grievous evil: Exactly as a man is born, so he will depart. What does he gain as he toils for the wind?
<span class="reftext">17</span>Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness, with much sorrow, sickness, and anger.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting: to eat and drink, and to find satisfaction in all the <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> one does under the sun during the few days of life that God has given him—for this is his lot.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Furthermore, God has given riches and wealth to every man, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has enabled him to enjoy them, to accept his lot, and to rejoice in his <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>. This is a gift from God.
<span class="reftext">20</span>For a man seldom considers the days of his life, because God keeps him occupied with the joy of his heart.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">angel</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
