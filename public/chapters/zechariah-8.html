<span class="reftext">2</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: “I am jealous for Zion with great zeal; I am jealous for her with great <span class='spell ca'>fervour</span><span class='spell gb'>fervour</span><span class='spell us'>fervor</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: “I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the <span class='cap'>City</span><span class='nocap'>city</span> of <span class='cap'>Truth</span><span class='nocap'>truth</span>, and the mountain of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts will be called the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Mountain</span><span class='nocap'>mountain</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: “Old men and old women will again sit along the streets of Jerusalem, each with a staff in hand because of great age.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing there.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: “If this is impossible<span class="fn">a</span>  in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be impossible in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> eyes?” declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: “I will save <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people from the land of the east and from the land of the west.
<span class="reftext">8</span>I will bring them back to dwell in Jerusalem, where they will be <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people, and I will be their faithful and righteous God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: “Let your hands be strong, you who now hear these words spoken by the prophets who were present when the foundations were laid to rebuild the temple, the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For before those days neither man nor beast received wages, nor was there safety from the enemy for anyone who came or went, for I had turned every man against his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>.
<span class="reftext">11</span>But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as I did in the past,” declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“For the seed will be prosperous, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will yield its produce, and the skies will give their dew. To the remnant of this people I will give all these things as an inheritance.
<span class="reftext">13</span>As you have been a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid; let your hands be strong.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: “Just as I resolved to bring disaster upon you when your fathers provoked <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to anger, and I did not relent,” says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts,
<span class="reftext">15</span>“so now I have resolved to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid.
<span class="reftext">16</span>These are the things you must do: Speak truth to one another, render true and sound <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span> in your gates,
<span class="reftext">17</span>do not plot evil in your hearts against your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>, and do not love to swear falsely, for I hate all these things,” declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">19</span>“This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: The fasts of the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, and the tenth months will become times of joy and gladness, cheerful feasts for the house of Judah. Therefore you are to love both truth and peace.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: “Peoples will yet come—the residents of many cities—
<span class="reftext">21</span>and the residents of one city will go to another, saying: ‘Let us go at once to plead before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and to seek <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts. I myself am going.’
<span class="reftext">22</span>And many peoples and strong nations will come to seek <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts in Jerusalem and to plead before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: “In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue will tightly grasp the robe of a Jew, saying, ‘Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6"><span class='spell ca'>marvellous</span><span class='spell gb'>marvellous</span><span class='spell us'>marvelous</span></i>; twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
