<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Daniel’s Vision by the Tigris</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar. The message was true, and it concerned a great conflict.<span class="fn">a</span>  And the understanding of the message was given to him in a vision.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three full weeks.
<span class="reftext">3</span>I ate no rich food, no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I did not anoint myself with oil until the three weeks were completed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris,
<span class="reftext">5</span>I lifted up my eyes, and behold, there was a certain man dressed in linen, with a belt of fine gold from Uphaz around his waist.
<span class="reftext">6</span>His body was like beryl, his face like the brilliance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of polished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Only I, Daniel, saw the vision; the men with me did not see it, but a great terror fell upon them, and they ran and hid themselves.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision. No strength remained in me; my face grew deathly pale, and I was powerless.
<span class="reftext">9</span>I heard the sound of his words, and as I listened, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Suddenly, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.
<span class="reftext">11</span>He said to me, “Daniel, you are a man who is highly precious. Consider carefully the words that I am about to say to you. Stand up, for I have now been sent to you.” </p><p class="reg1"> And when he had said this to me, I stood up trembling.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“Do not be afraid, Daniel,” he said, “for from the first day that you purposed to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.
<span class="reftext">13</span>However, the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the latter days, for the vision concerns those days.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>While he was speaking these words to me, I set my face toward the ground and became speechless.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And suddenly one with the likeness of a man<span class="fn">b</span>  touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and said to the one standing before me, “My lord, because of the vision, I am overcome with anguish, and I have no strength.
<span class="reftext">17</span>How can I, your servant, speak with you, my lord? Now I have no strength, nor is any breath left in me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Again the one with the likeness of a man touched me and strengthened me.
<span class="reftext">19</span>“Do not be afraid, you who are highly precious,” he said. “Peace be with you! Be strong now; be very strong!” </p><p class="reg1"> As he spoke with me, I was strengthened and said, “Speak, my lord, for you have strengthened me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>“Do you know why I have come to you?” he said. “I must return at once to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I have gone forth, behold, the prince of Greece<span class="fn">c</span>  will come.
<span class="reftext">21</span>But first I will tell you what is inscribed in the Book of Truth. Yet no one has the courage to support me against these, except Michael your prince.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">true and greatly burdensome</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Most MT manuscripts; literally <i class="calibre6">with the likeness of sons of man</i>; DSS, LXX, and one MT manuscript <i class="calibre6">with the likeness of the hand of a man</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">of Javan</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
