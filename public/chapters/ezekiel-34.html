<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>A Prophecy against Israel’s Shepherds</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel.
Prophesy and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Woe to
the shepherds of Israel, who only feed themselves! Should not the
shepherds feed their flock? You eat the fat, wear the wool, and
butcher the fattened sheep, but you do not feed the flock. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You have not strengthened the weak, healed
the sick, bound up the injured, brought back the strays, or searched
for the lost. Instead, you have ruled them with violence and cruelty.
They were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and when they were
scattered they became food for all the wild beasts. My flock went
astray on all the mountains and every high hill. They were scattered
over the face of all the earth, with no one to search for them or
seek them out.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of
the LORD: ‘As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, because My
flock lacks a shepherd and has become prey and food for every wild
beast, and because My shepherds did not search for My flock but fed
themselves instead, therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the
LORD!’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold,
I am against the shepherds, and I will demand from them My flock and
remove them from tending the flock, so that they can no longer feed
themselves. For I will deliver My flock from their mouths, and it
will no longer be food for them.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For this is what the Lord GOD says:
‘Behold, I Myself will search for My flock and seek them out. As a
shepherd looks for his scattered sheep when he is among the flock, so
I will look for My flock. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will rescue them from all the places to
which they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. I will
bring them out from the peoples, gather them from the countries, and
bring them into their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of
Israel, in the ravines, and in all the settlements of the land. I
will feed them in good pasture, and the lofty mountains of Israel
will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in a good
grazing land; they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of
Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will tend My flock and make them lie
down, declares the Lord GOD. I will seek the lost, bring back the
strays, bind up the broken, and strengthen the weak; but the sleek
and strong I will destroy. I will shepherd them with justice.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what the Lord GOD says to you, My
flock: ‘I will judge between one sheep and another, between the
rams and the goats. Is it not enough for you to feed on the good
pasture? Must you also trample the rest of the pasture with your
feet? Is it not enough for you to drink the clear waters? Must you
also muddy the rest with your feet? Why must My flock feed on what
your feet have trampled, and drink what your feet have muddied?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says
to them: ‘Behold, I Myself will judge between the fat sheep and the
lean sheep. Since you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the
weak ones with your horns until you have scattered them abroad, I
will save My flock, and they will no longer be prey. I will judge
between one sheep and another. I will appoint over them one shepherd,
My servant David, and he will feed them. He will feed them and be
their shepherd. I, the LORD, will be their God, and My servant David
will be a prince among them. I, the LORD, have spoken. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will make with them a covenant of peace
and rid the land of wild animals, so that they may dwell securely in
the wilderness and sleep in the forest. I will make them and the
places around My hill a blessing. I will send down showers in
season—showers of blessing. The trees of the field will give their
fruit, and the land will yield its produce; My flock will be secure
in their land. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have
broken the bars of their yoke and delivered them from the hands that
enslaved them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They will no longer be prey for the
nations, and the beasts of the earth will not consume them. They will
dwell securely, and no one will frighten them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And I will raise up for them a garden of
renown, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or
bear the scorn of the nations. Then they will know that I, the LORD
their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My
people,’ declares the Lord GOD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">You are My flock, the sheep of My
pasture, My people, and I am your God,’ declares the Lord GOD.” </font>
