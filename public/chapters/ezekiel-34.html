<span class="reftext">2</span>“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who only feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed their flock?
<span class="reftext">3</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> eat the fat, wear the wool, and butcher the fattened sheep, but <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not feed the flock.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, bound up the injured, brought back the strays, or searched for the lost. Instead, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have ruled them with violence and cruelty.
<span class="reftext">5</span>They were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild beasts.
<span class="reftext">6</span>My flock went astray on all the mountains and every high hill. They were scattered over the face of all the earth, with no one to search for them or seek them out.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> shepherds, hear the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>:
<span class="reftext">8</span>‘As surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, because <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> flock lacks a shepherd and has become prey and food for every wild beast, and because <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> shepherds did not search for <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> flock but fed themselves instead,
<span class="reftext">9</span>therefore, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> shepherds, hear the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>!’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will demand from them <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> flock and remove them from tending the flock, so that they can no longer feed themselves. For I will deliver <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them.’
</p><p class="hdg">The Good Shepherd<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 23:1–6; John 10:1–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span><span class='bsb'>Myself</span> will search for <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> flock and seek them out.
<span class="reftext">12</span>As a shepherd looks for his scattered sheep when he is among the flock, so I will look for <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> flock. </p><p class="reg1"> I will rescue them from all the places to which they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.
<span class="reftext">13</span>I will bring them out from the peoples, gather them from the countries, and bring them into their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines, and in all the settlements of the land.
<span class="reftext">14</span>I will feed them in good pasture, and the lofty mountains of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in a good grazing land; they will feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>I will tend <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> flock and make them lie down, declares the Lord GOD.
<span class="reftext">16</span>I will seek the lost, bring back the strays, bind up the broken, and strengthen the weak; but the sleek and strong I will destroy. I will shepherd them with justice.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>This is what the Lord GOD says to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> flock: ‘I will judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and the goats.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Is it not enough for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to feed on the good pasture? Must <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> also trample the rest of the pasture with <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> feet? Is it not enough for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to drink the clear waters? Must <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> also muddy the rest with <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> feet?
<span class="reftext">19</span>Why must <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> flock feed on what <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> feet have trampled, and drink what <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> feet have muddied?’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says to them: ‘Behold, I <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span><span class='bsb'>Myself</span> will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Since <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak ones with <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> horns until <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have scattered them abroad,
<span class="reftext">22</span>I will save <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> flock, and they will no longer be prey. I will judge between one sheep and another.
<span class="reftext">23</span>I will appoint over them one shepherd, <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> servant David, and he will feed them. He will feed them and be their shepherd.
<span class="reftext">24</span>I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, will be their God, and <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> servant David will be a prince among them. I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have spoken.
</p><p class="hdg">The Covenant of Peace</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>I will make with them a covenant of peace and rid the land of wild animals, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forest.
<span class="reftext">26</span>I will make them and the places around <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> hill a blessing. I will send down showers in season—showers of blessing.
<span class="reftext">27</span>The trees of the field will give their fruit, and the land will yield its produce; <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> flock will be secure in their land.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>They will no longer be prey for the nations, and the beasts of the earth will not consume them. They will dwell securely, and no one will frighten them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>And I will raise up for them a garden of renown, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Then they will know that I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people,’ declares the Lord GOD.
