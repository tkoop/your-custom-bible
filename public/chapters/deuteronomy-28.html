<span class="reftext">2</span>And all these blessings will come upon you and overtake you, if you will obey the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>You will be blessed in the city </p><p class="indent"> and blessed in the country.

<span class="reftext">9</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will establish you as His holy people, just as He has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God and walk in His ways.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will turn the rain of your land into dust and powder; it will descend on you from the sky until you are destroyed.

<span class="reftext">26</span>Your corpses will be food for all the birds of the air and beasts of the earth, with no one to scare them away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will afflict you with the boils of Egypt, with tumors and scabs and itch from which you cannot be cured.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will afflict you with madness, blindness, and confusion of mind,
<span class="reftext">29</span>and at noon you will grope about like a blind man in the darkness. You will not prosper in your ways. Day after day you will be oppressed and plundered, with no one to save you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>You will be pledged in marriage to a woman, but another man will violate her. You will build a house but will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard but will not enjoy its fruit.
<span class="reftext">31</span>Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat any of it. Your donkey will be taken away and not returned to you. Your flock will be given to your enemies, and no one will save you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, while your eyes grow weary looking for them day after day, with no power in your hand.
<span class="reftext">33</span>A people you do not know will eat the produce of your land and of all your toil. All your days you will be oppressed and crushed.
<span class="reftext">34</span>You will be driven mad by the sights you see.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will afflict you with painful, incurable boils on your knees and thighs, from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>You will sow much seed in the field but harvest little, because the locusts will consume it.
<span class="reftext">39</span>You will plant and cultivate vineyards, but will neither drink the wine nor gather the grapes, because worms will eat them.
<span class="reftext">40</span>You will have olive trees throughout your territory but will never anoint yourself with oil, because the olives will drop off.
<span class="reftext">41</span>You will father sons and daughters, but they will not remain yours, because they will go into captivity.
<span class="reftext">42</span>Swarms of locusts will consume all your trees and the produce of your land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>The foreigner living among you will rise higher and higher above you, while you sink down lower and lower.
<span class="reftext">44</span>He will lend to you, but you will not lend to him. He will be the head, and you will be the tail.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>All these curses will come upon you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, since you did not obey <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God and keep the commandments and statutes He gave you.
<span class="reftext">46</span>These curses will be a sign and a wonder upon you and your descendants forever.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>Because you did not serve <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God with joy and gladness of heart in all your abundance,
<span class="reftext">48</span>you will serve your enemies <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will send against you in famine, thirst, nakedness, and destitution. He will place an iron yoke on your neck until He has destroyed you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">49</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will bring a nation from afar, from the ends of the earth, to swoop down upon you like an eagle—a nation whose language you will not understand,
<span class="reftext">50</span>a ruthless nation with no respect for the old and no pity for the young.
<span class="reftext">51</span>They will eat the offspring of your livestock and the produce of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain or new wine or oil, no calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks, until they have caused you to perish.
<span class="reftext">52</span>They will besiege all the cities throughout your land, until the high and fortified walls in which you trust have fallen. They will besiege all your cities throughout the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has given you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">53</span>Then you will eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters whom <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has given you, in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">54</span>The most gentle and refined man among you will begrudge his brother, the wife he embraces,<span class="fn">c</span>  and the rest of his children who have survived,
<span class="reftext">55</span>refusing to share with any of them the flesh of his children he will eat because he has nothing left in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you within all your gates.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">56</span>The most gentle and refined woman among you, so gentle and refined she would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground, will begrudge the husband she embraces<span class="fn">e</span>  and her son and daughter
<span class="reftext">57</span>the afterbirth that comes from between her legs and the children she bears, because she will secretly eat them for lack of anything else in the siege and distress that your enemy will inflict on you within your gates.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">58</span>If you are not careful to observe all the words of this law which are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name—<span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God—
<span class="reftext">59</span>He will bring upon you and your descendants extraordinary disasters, severe and lasting plagues, and terrible and chronic sicknesses.
<span class="reftext">60</span>He will afflict you again with all the diseases you dreaded in Egypt, and they will cling to you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">61</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will also bring upon you every sickness and plague not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed.
<span class="reftext">62</span>You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left few in number, because you would not obey the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">63</span>Just as it pleased <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to make you prosper and multiply, so also it will please Him to annihilate you and destroy you. And you will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">64</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will scatter you among all the nations, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.
<span class="reftext">65</span>Among those nations you will find no repose, not even a resting place for the sole of your foot. There <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a despairing soul.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">66</span>So your life will hang in doubt before you, and you will be afraid night and day, never certain of survival.
<span class="reftext">67</span>In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were evening!’ and in the evening you will say, ‘If only it were morning!’—because of the dread in your hearts of the terrifying sights you will see.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">68</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will return you to Egypt in ships by a route that I said you should never see again. There you will sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Me</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">sword</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">54</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the wife of his bosom</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">55</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">within all your cities</i>; similarly in verse 57<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">56</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the husband of her bosom</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
