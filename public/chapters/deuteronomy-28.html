offspring of your livestock and the produce of your land until you
are destroyed. They will leave you no grain or new wine or oil, no
calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks, until they have caused
you to perish. They will besiege all the cities throughout your land,
until the high and fortified walls in which you trust have fallen.
They will besiege all your cities throughout the land that the LORD
your God has given you. </font>

lack of anything else in the siege and distress that your enemy will
inflict on you within your gates. </font>

<font >If you are not careful to observe all the
words of this law which are written in this book, that you may fear
this glorious and awesome name—the LORD your God— He will bring
upon you and your descendants extraordinary disasters, severe and
lasting plagues, and terrible and chronic sicknesses. He will afflict
you again with all the diseases you dreaded in Egypt, and they will
cling to you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD will also bring upon you every
sickness and plague not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you
are destroyed. You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will
be left few in number, because you would not obey the voice of the
LORD your God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Just as it pleased the LORD to make you
prosper and multiply, so also it will please Him to annihilate you

entering to possess. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD will scatter you among all
the nations, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you
will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone, which neither you
nor your fathers have known. Among those nations you will find no
repose, not even a resting place for the sole of your foot. There the
LORD will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a despairing
soul. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So your life will hang in doubt before
you, and you will be afraid night and day, never certain of survival.
In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were evening!’ and in
the evening you will say, ‘If only it were morning!’—because of
the dread in your hearts of the terrifying sights you will see. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD will return you to Egypt in ships
by a route that I said you should never see again. There you will
sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one
will buy you.” </font>
