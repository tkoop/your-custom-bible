</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“As surely as God lives, who has deprived me of justice—</p><p class="indent"> the Almighty, who has embittered my soul—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>as long as my breath is still within me </p><p class="indent"> and the breath of God remains in my nostrils,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>my lips will not speak wickedness, </p><p class="indent"> and my tongue will not utter deceit.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>I will never say that you are right; </p><p class="indent"> I will maintain my integrity until I die.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>I will cling to my righteousness and never let go. </p><p class="indent"> As long as I live, my conscience will not accuse me.
</p><p class="hdg">The Wicked Man’s Portion</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>May my enemy be like the wicked </p><p class="indent"> and my opponent like the unjust.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, </p><p class="indent"> when God takes away his life?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Will God hear his cry </p><p class="indent"> when distress comes upon him?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Will he delight in the Almighty? </p><p class="indent"> Will he call upon God at all times?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>I will instruct you in the power of God. </p><p class="indent"> I will not conceal the ways of the Almighty.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Surely all of you have seen it for yourselves. </p><p class="indent"> Why then do you keep up this empty talk?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>This is the wicked man’s portion from God—</p><p class="indent"> the heritage the ruthless receive from the Almighty.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; </p><p class="indent"> and his offspring will never have enough food.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>His survivors will be buried by the plague, </p><p class="indent"> and their widows will not weep for them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Though he heaps up silver like dust </p><p class="indent"> and piles up a wardrobe like clay,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>what he lays up, the righteous will wear, </p><p class="indent"> and his silver will be divided by the innocent.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon, </p><p class="indent"> like a hut set up by a watchman.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; </p><p class="indent"> when he opens his eyes, all is gone.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Terrors overtake him like a flood; </p><p class="indent"> a tempest sweeps him away in the night.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; </p><p class="indent"> it sweeps him out of his place.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>It hurls itself against him without mercy </p><p class="indent"> as he flees headlong from its power.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>It claps its hands at him </p><p class="indent"> and hisses him out of his place.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
