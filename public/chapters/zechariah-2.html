</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Where are you going?” I asked. </p><p class="reg1">“To measure Jerusalem,” he replied, “and to determine its width and length.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel came out to meet him
<span class="reftext">4</span>and said to him, “Run and tell that young man: ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the multitude of men and livestock within it.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For I will be a wall of fire around it, declares the LORD, and I will be the glory within it.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “After His Glory has sent Me<span class="fn">a</span>  against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple<span class="fn">b</span>  of His eye—
<span class="reftext">9</span>I will surely wave My hand over them, so that they will become plunder for their own servants. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>“Shout for joy and be glad, O Daughter of Zion, for I am coming to dwell among you,” declares the LORD.
