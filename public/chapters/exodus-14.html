<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Pharaoh Pursues the Israelites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal-zephon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, ‘They are wandering the land in confusion; the wilderness has boxed them in.’
<span class="reftext">4</span>And I will harden<span class="fn">a</span>  Pharaoh’s heart so that he will pursue them. But I will gain <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> by means of Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.” </p><p class="reg1"> So this is what the Israelites did.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, “What have we done? We have released Israel from serving us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So Pharaoh prepared his chariot and took his army with him.
<span class="reftext">7</span>He took 600 of the best chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out defiantly.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">9</span>The Egyptians—all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, horsemen and troops—pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians marching after them, and they were terrified and cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">11</span>They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us into the wilderness to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
<span class="reftext">12</span>Did we not say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But Moses told the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s salvation, which <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will accomplish for you today; for the Egyptians you see today, you will never see again.
<span class="reftext">14</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will fight for you; you need only to be still.”
</p><p class="hdg">Parting the Red Sea</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>? Tell the Israelites to go forward.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And as for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. Then I will gain <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> by means of Pharaoh and all his army and chariots and horsemen.
<span class="reftext">18</span>The Egyptians will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> when I am <span class='spell ca'>honoured</span><span class='spell gb'>honoured</span><span class='spell us'>honored</span> through Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And the angel<span class="fn">c</span>  of God, who had gone before the camp of Israel, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from before them and stood behind them,
<span class="reftext">20</span>so that it came between the camps of Egypt and Israel. The cloud was there in the darkness, but it lit up the night.<span class="fn">d</span>  So all night long neither camp went near the other.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> drove back the sea with a strong east wind that turned it into dry land. So the waters were divided,
<span class="reftext">22</span>and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>And the Egyptians chased after them—all Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen—and followed them into the sea.
<span class="reftext">24</span>At morning watch, however, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> looked down on the army of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> threw their camp into confusion.
<span class="reftext">25</span>He caused their chariot wheels to wobble,<span class="fn">e</span>  so that they had difficulty driving. “Let us flee from the Israelites,” said the Egyptians, “for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is fighting for them against Egypt!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen.”
<span class="reftext">27</span>So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal state. As the Egyptians were retreating, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> swept them into the sea.
<span class="reftext">28</span>The waters flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had chased the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>But the Israelites had walked through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left.
<span class="reftext">30</span>That day <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> saved Israel from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore.
<span class="reftext">31</span>When Israel saw the great power that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had exercised over the Egyptians, the people feared <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and believed in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> servant Moses.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">stiffen</i> or <i class="calibre6">strengthen</i>; similarly in verses 8 and 17<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">marching out boldly</i>; literally <i class="calibre6">marching out with an upraised hand</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">and the night passed</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">to swerve</i> or <i class="calibre6">to come off</i> or <i class="calibre6">to bind</i>; see also SP, LXX, and Syriac.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
