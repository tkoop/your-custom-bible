<font ><b>God’s Judgment on the Ungodly</b></font></p>

<font >Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a
brother of James, </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >To those who are called, loved by God the
Father, and kept in Jesus Christ: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to
you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Beloved, although I made every effort to
write to you about the salvation we share, I felt it necessary to
write and urge you to contend earnestly for the faith entrusted once
for all to the saints. For certain men have crept in among you
unnoticed—ungodly ones who were designated long ago for
condemnation. They turn the grace of our God into a license for
immorality, and they deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Although you are fully aware of this, I
want to remind you that after Jesus had delivered His people out of
the land of Egypt, He destroyed those who did not believe. And the
angels who did not stay within their own domain but abandoned their
proper dwelling—these He has kept in eternal chains under darkness,
bound for judgment on that great day. In like manner, Sodom and
Gomorrah and the cities around them, who indulged in sexual
immorality and pursued strange flesh, are on display as an example of
those who sustain the punishment of eternal fire. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet in the same way these dreamers defile
their bodies, reject authority, and slander glorious beings. But even
the archangel Michael, when he disputed with the devil over the body
of Moses, did not presume to bring a slanderous charge against him,
but said, “The Lord rebuke you!” These men, however, slander what
they do not understand, and like irrational animals, they will be
destroyed by the things they do instinctively. Woe to them! They have
traveled the path of Cain; they have rushed headlong into the error
of Balaam; they have perished in Korah’s rebellion. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These men are hidden reefs in your love
feasts, shamelessly feasting with you but shepherding only
themselves. They are clouds without water, carried along by the wind;
fruitless trees in autumn, twice dead after being uprooted. They are
wild waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars,
for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also
prophesied about them: </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Behold, the Lord is coming </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >with myriads of His holy ones </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >to execute judgment on everyone, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and to convict all the ungodly </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >of every ungodly act of wickedness </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and every harsh word spoken against Him by
ungodly sinners.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These men are discontented grumblers,
following after their own lusts; their mouths spew arrogance; they
flatter others for their own advantage. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But you, beloved, remember what was
foretold by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ when they said to
you, “In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow
after their own ungodly desires.” These are the ones who cause
divisions, who are worldly and devoid of the Spirit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But you, beloved, by building yourselves
up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, keep
yourselves in the love of God as you await the mercy of our Lord
Jesus Christ to bring you eternal life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And indeed, have mercy on those who doubt;
save others by snatching them from the fire; and to still others show
mercy tempered with fear, hating even the clothing stained by the
flesh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now to Him who is able to keep you from
stumbling and to present you unblemished in His glorious presence,
with great joy— to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty,
dominion, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord before all
time, and now, and for all eternity. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Amen. </font>
