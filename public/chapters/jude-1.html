</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Judgment on the Ungodly<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Peter 3:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Beloved, although I made every effort to write to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> about the salvation we share, I felt it necessary to write and urge <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to contend earnestly for the faith entrusted once for all to the saints.
<span class="reftext">4</span>For certain men have crept in among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> unnoticed—ungodly ones who were designated long ago for condemnation. They turn the grace of our God into a <span class='spell ca'>licence</span><span class='spell gb'>licence</span><span class='spell us'>license</span> for immorality, and they deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Although <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are fully aware of this, I want to remind <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> that after Jesus<span class="fn">a</span>  had delivered <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> people out of the land of Egypt, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> destroyed those who did not believe.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the angels who did not stay within their own domain but abandoned their proper dwelling—these <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has kept in eternal chains under darkness, bound for <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> on that great day.
<span class="reftext">7</span>In like manner, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, who indulged in sexual immorality and pursued strange flesh, are on display as an example of those who sustain the punishment of eternal fire.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Yet in the same way these dreamers defile their bodies, reject authority, and slander glorious beings.
<span class="reftext">9</span>But even the archangel Michael, when he disputed with the devil over the body of Moses, did not presume to bring a slanderous charge against him, but said, “The Lord rebuke you!”<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">10</span>These men, however, slander what they do not understand, and like irrational animals, they will be destroyed by the things they do instinctively.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Woe to them! They have <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> the path of Cain; they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam; they have perished in Korah’s rebellion.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>These men are hidden reefs<span class="fn">c</span>  in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> love feasts, shamelessly feasting with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> but shepherding only themselves. They are clouds without water, carried along by the wind; fruitless trees in autumn, twice dead after being uprooted.
<span class="reftext">13</span>They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Enoch, the seventh from Adam, also prophesied about them: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Behold, the Lord is coming </p><p class="indent"> with myriads of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> holy ones
