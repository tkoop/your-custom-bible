<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Throne in Heaven</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After this I looked and saw a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had previously heard speak to me like a trumpet was saying, <span>“Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>At once I was in the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, and I saw a throne standing in heaven, with someone seated on it.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> seated there looked like jasper and carnelian, and a rainbow that gleamed like an emerald encircled the throne.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these thrones sat twenty-four elders dressed in white, with golden crowns on their heads.
</p><p class="hdg">Worship of the Creator</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder. Before the throne burned seven torches of fire. These are the seven <span class='cap'>Spirits</span><span class='nocap'>spirits</span><span class="fn">a</span>  of God.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, as clear as crystal. In the <span class='spell ca'>centre</span><span class='spell gb'>centre</span><span class='spell us'>center</span>, around the throne, were four living creatures, covered with eyes in front and back.
<span class="reftext">7</span>The first living creature was like a lion, the second like a calf, the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around and within. Day and night they never stop saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Holy, <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span>, <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span>, </p><p class="indent"> is the Lord God <span class='cap'>Almighty</span><span class='nocap'>almighty</span>, </p><p class="indent"> who was and is and is to come!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And whenever the living creatures give glory, <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span>, and thanks to the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> seated on the throne who lives forever and ever,
<span class="reftext">10</span>the twenty-four elders fall down before the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> seated on the throne, and they worship <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>“Worthy are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>, our Lord and God, </p><p class="indent"> to receive glory and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> and power, </p><p class="indent1"> for <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> created all things; </p><p class="indent"> by <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> will they exist and came to be.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">This is the sevenfold Spirit</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
