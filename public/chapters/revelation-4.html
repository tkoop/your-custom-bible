<font >After this I looked and saw a door
standing open in heaven. And the voice I had previously heard speak
to me like a trumpet was saying, <font color="#a80000">“Come up
here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.”</font>

<font >At once I was in the Spirit, and I saw a
throne standing in heaven, with someone seated on it. The One seated
there looked like jasper and carnelian, and a rainbow that gleamed
like an emerald encircled the throne. Surrounding the throne were
twenty-four other thrones, and on these thrones sat twenty-four
elders dressed in white, with golden crowns on their heads. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From the throne came flashes of lightning,
and rumblings, and peals of thunder. Before the throne burned seven
torches of fire. These are the seven Spirits of God. And before the
throne was something like a sea of glass, as clear as crystal. In the

eyes in front and back. The first living creature was like a lion,
the second like a calf, the third had a face like a man, and the
fourth was like an eagle in flight. And each of the four living
creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around and
within. Day and night they never stop saying: </font>

<font >And whenever the living creatures give
glory, honor, and thanks to the One seated on the throne who lives
forever and ever, the twenty-four elders fall down before the One
seated on the throne, and they worship Him who lives forever and
