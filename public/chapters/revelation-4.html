And the voice I had previously heard speak to me like a trumpet was saying, <span>“Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>At once I was in the Spirit, and I saw a throne standing in heaven, with someone seated on it.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The One seated there looked like jasper and carnelian, and a rainbow that gleamed like an emerald encircled the throne.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these thrones sat twenty-four elders dressed in white, with golden crowns on their heads.
</p><p class="hdg">Worship of the Creator</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder. Before the throne burned seven torches of fire. These are the seven Spirits<span class="fn">a</span>  of God.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, as clear as crystal. In the centre, around the throne, were four living creatures, covered with eyes in front and back.
<span class="reftext">7</span>The first living creature was like a lion, the second like a calf, the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around and within. Day and night they never stop saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Holy, Holy, Holy, </p><p class="indent"> is the Lord God Almighty, </p><p class="indent"> who was and is and is to come!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And whenever the living creatures give glory, honour, and thanks to the One seated on the throne who lives forever and ever,
<span class="reftext">10</span>the twenty-four elders fall down before the One seated on the throne, and they worship Him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>“Worthy are You, our Lord and God, </p><p class="indent"> to receive glory and honour and power, </p><p class="indent1"> for You created all things; </p><p class="indent"> by Your will they exist and came to be.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">This is the sevenfold Spirit</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
