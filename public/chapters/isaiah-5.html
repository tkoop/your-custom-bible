</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>He dug it up and cleared the stones </p><p class="indent"> and planted the finest vines. </p><p class="indent1"> He built a watchtower in the middle </p><p class="indent"> and dug out a winepress as well. </p><p class="indent1stline"> He waited for the vineyard to yield good grapes, </p><p class="indent"> but the fruit it produced was sour!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>“And now, O dwellers of Jerusalem </p><p class="indent"> and men of Judah, </p><p class="indent1"> I exhort you to judge </p><p class="indent"> between Me and My vineyard.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>What more could I have done for My vineyard </p><p class="indent"> than I already did for it? </p><p class="indent1"> Why, when I expected sweet grapes, </p><p class="indent"> did it bring forth sour fruit?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now I will tell you what I am about to do to My vineyard: </p><p class="indent1stline"> I will take away its hedge, </p><p class="indent"> and it will be consumed; </p><p class="indent1"> I will tear down its wall, </p><p class="indent"> and it will be trampled.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>I will make it a wasteland, </p><p class="indent"> neither pruned nor cultivated, </p><p class="indent"> and thorns and briers will grow up. </p><p class="indent1"> I will command the clouds </p><p class="indent"> that rain shall not fall on it.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>For the vineyard of the LORD of Hosts </p><p class="indent"> is the house of Israel, </p><p class="indent1"> and the men of Judah </p><p class="indent"> are the plant of His delight. </p><p class="indent1"> He looked for justice, </p><p class="indent"> but saw bloodshed; </p><p class="indent1"> for righteousness, </p><p class="indent"> but heard a cry of distress.
</p><p class="hdg">Woes to the Wicked</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Woe to you who add house to house </p><p class="indent"> and join field to field </p><p class="indent1"> until no place is left </p><p class="indent"> and you live alone in the land.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>I heard the LORD of Hosts declare: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Surely many houses will become desolate, </p><p class="indent"> great mansions left unoccupied.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>For ten acres of vineyard </p><p class="indent"> will yield but a bath of wine,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> and a homer of seed </p><p class="indent"> only an ephah of grain.<span class="fn">b</span>”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>Woe to those who rise early in the morning </p><p class="indent"> in pursuit of strong drink, </p><p class="indent1"> who linger into the evening, </p><p class="indent"> to be inflamed by wine.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>At their feasts are the lyre and harp, </p><p class="indent"> tambourines and flutes and wine. </p><p class="indent1"> They disregard the actions of the LORD </p><p class="indent"> and fail to see the work of His hands.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore My people will go into exile </p><p class="indent"> for their lack of understanding; </p><p class="indent1"> their dignitaries are starving </p><p class="indent"> and their masses are parched with thirst.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat </p><p class="indent"> and opens wide its enormous jaws, </p><p class="indent1"> and down go Zion’s nobles and masses, </p><p class="indent"> her revelers and carousers!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>So mankind will be brought low, and each man humbled; </p><p class="indent"> the arrogant will lower their eyes.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But the LORD of Hosts will be exalted by His justice, </p><p class="indent"> and the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Lambs will graze as in their own pastures, </p><p class="indent"> and strangers<span class="fn">c</span>  will feed in the ruins of the wealthy.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of deceit </p><p class="indent"> and pull sin along with cart ropes,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>to those who say, “Let Him hurry and hasten His work </p><p class="indent"> so that we may see it! </p><p class="indent1"> Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come </p><p class="indent"> so that we may know it!”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Woe to those who call evil good </p><p class="indent"> and good evil, </p><p class="indent1"> who turn darkness to light </p><p class="indent"> and light to darkness, </p><p class="indent1"> who replace bitter with sweet </p><p class="indent"> and sweet with bitter.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes </p><p class="indent"> and clever in their own sight.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine </p><p class="indent"> and champions in mixing strong drink,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>who acquit the guilty for a bribe </p><p class="indent"> and deprive the innocent of justice.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes the straw, </p><p class="indent"> and as dry grass shrivels in the flame, </p><p class="indent1"> so their roots will decay </p><p class="indent"> and their blossoms will blow away like dust; </p><p class="indent1"> for they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of Hosts </p><p class="indent"> and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Therefore the anger of the LORD burns against His people; </p><p class="indent"> His hand is raised against them to strike them down. </p><p class="indent1"> The mountains quake, </p><p class="indent"> and the corpses lay like refuse in the streets. </p><p class="indent1stline"> Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; </p><p class="indent"> His hand is still upraised.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>He lifts a banner for the distant nations </p><p class="indent"> and whistles for those at the ends of the earth. </p><p class="indent"> Behold—how speedily and swiftly they come!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>None of them grows weary or stumbles; </p><p class="indent"> no one slumbers or sleeps. </p><p class="indent1"> No belt is loose </p><p class="indent"> and no sandal strap is broken.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Their arrows are sharpened, </p><p class="indent"> and all their bows are strung. </p><p class="indent1"> The hooves of their horses are like flint; </p><p class="indent"> their chariot wheels are like a whirlwind.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Their roaring is like that of a lion; </p><p class="indent"> they roar like young lions. </p><p class="indent1"> They growl and seize their prey; </p><p class="indent"> they carry it away from deliverance.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>In that day they will roar over it, </p><p class="indent"> like the roaring of the sea. </p><p class="indent1"> If one looks over the land, </p><p class="indent"> he will see darkness and distress; </p><p class="indent"> even the light will be obscured by clouds.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">ten yoke of vineyard will yield a bath</i>; that is, the area ten yoke of oxen can plow in a day will yield approximately 5.8 gallons or 22 liters of wine.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">and a homer of seed will yield an ephah</i>; that is, a homer of seed (approximately 6.24 bushels or 220 liters) will yield a tenth of its weight in grain.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">lambs</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
