<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the whole congregation lifted up
their voices and cried out, and that night the people wept. All the
Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole
congregation said to them, “If only we had died in the land of
Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness! Why is the LORD
bringing us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and
children will become plunder. Would it not be better for us to go
back to Egypt?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they said to one another, “Let us
appoint a leader and return to Egypt.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown before
the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of
Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore
their clothes and said to the whole congregation of Israel, “The
land we passed through and explored is an exceedingly good land. If
the LORD delights in us, He will bring us into this land, a land
flowing with milk and honey, and He will give it to us. Only do not
rebel against the LORD, and do not be afraid of the people of the
land, for they will be like bread for us. Their protection has been
removed, and the LORD is with us. Do not be afraid of them!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the whole congregation threatened to
stone Joshua and Caleb. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the glory of the LORD appeared to all
the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting. And the LORD said to Moses,
“How long will this people treat Me with contempt? How long will
they refuse to believe in Me, despite all the signs I have performed
among them? I will strike them with a plague and destroy them—and I
will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Moses said to the LORD, “The
Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your strength You brought this
people from among them. And they will tell it to the inhabitants of
this land. They have already heard that You, O LORD, are in the midst
of this people, that You, O LORD, have been seen face to face, that
Your cloud stands over them, and that You go before them in a pillar
of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If You kill this people as one man, the
nations who have heard of Your fame will say, ‘Because the LORD was
unable to bring this people into the land He swore to give them, He
has slaughtered them in the wilderness.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So now I pray, may the power of my Lord be
magnified, just as You have declared: ‘The LORD is slow to anger
and abounding in loving devotion, forgiving iniquity and
transgression. Yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished;
He will visit the iniquity of the fathers upon their children to the
third and fourth generation.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this
people, in keeping with the greatness of Your loving devotion, just
as You have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I have pardoned them as you requested,”
the LORD replied. “Yet as surely as I live and as surely as the
whole earth is filled with the glory of the LORD, not one of the men
who have seen My glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the
wilderness—yet have tested Me and disobeyed Me these ten times—
not one will ever see the land that I swore to give their fathers.
None of those who have treated Me with contempt will see it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But because My servant Caleb has a
different spirit and has followed Me wholeheartedly, I will bring him
into the land he has entered, and his descendants will inherit it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now since the Amalekites and Canaanites
are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and head for the
wilderness along the route to the Red Sea.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
“How long will this wicked congregation grumble against Me? I have
heard the complaints that the Israelites are making against Me. So
tell them: As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you
exactly as I heard you say. Your bodies will fall in this
wilderness—all who were numbered in the census, everyone twenty
years of age or older—because you have grumbled against Me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Surely none of you will enter the land in
which I swore to settle you, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua
son of Nun. But I will bring your children, whom you said would
become plunder, into the land you have rejected—and they will enjoy
it. As for you, however, your bodies will fall in this wilderness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Your children will be shepherds in the
wilderness for forty years, and they will suffer for your
unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness.
In keeping with the forty days you spied out the land, you shall bear
your guilt forty years—a year for each day—and you will
experience My alienation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will
surely do these things to this entire wicked congregation, which has
conspired against Me. They will meet their end in the wilderness, and
there they will die.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the men Moses had sent to spy out the
land, who had returned and made the whole congregation grumble
against him by bringing out a bad report about the land— those men
who had brought out the bad report about the land—were struck down
by a plague before the LORD. Of those men who had gone to spy out the
land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh remained
alive. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when Moses relayed these words to all
the Israelites, the people mourned bitterly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Early the next morning they got up and
went up toward the ridge of the hill country. “We have indeed
sinned,” they said, “but we will go to the place the LORD has
promised.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Moses said, “Why are you
transgressing the commandment of the LORD? This will not succeed! Do
not go up, lest you be struck down by your enemies, because the LORD
is not among you. For there the Amalekites and Canaanites will face
you, and you will fall by the sword. Because you have turned away
from the LORD, He will not be with you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But they dared to go up to the ridge of
the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the covenant of
the LORD moved from the camp. Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who
lived in that part of the hill country came down, attacked them, and
routed them all the way to Hormah. </font>
