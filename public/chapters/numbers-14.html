<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Israel’s Rebellion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 1:26–33)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the whole congregation lifted up their voices and cried out, and that night the people wept.
<span class="reftext">2</span>All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole congregation said to them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness!
<span class="reftext">3</span>Why is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> bringing us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will become plunder. Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So they said to one another, “Let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown before the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes
<span class="reftext">7</span>and said to the whole congregation of Israel, “The land we passed through and explored is an exceedingly good land.
<span class="reftext">8</span>If <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> delights in us, He will bring us into this land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and He will give it to us.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Only do not rebel against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and do not be afraid of the people of the land, for they will be like bread for us. Their protection has been removed, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is with us. Do not be afraid of them!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>But the whole congregation threatened to stone Joshua and Caleb. </p><p class="reg1"> Then the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> appeared to all the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses, “How long will this people treat Me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in Me, despite all the signs I have performed among them?
<span class="reftext">12</span>I will strike them with a plague and destroy them—and I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are.”
</p><p class="hdg">Moses Intercedes for Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But Moses said to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “The Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your strength You brought this people from among them.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have already heard that You, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, are in the midst of this people, that You, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, have been seen face to face, that Your cloud stands over them, and that You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>If You kill this people as one man, the nations who have heard of Your fame will say,
<span class="reftext">16</span>‘Because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was unable to bring this people into the land He swore to give them, He has slaughtered them in the wilderness.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So now I pray, may the power of my Lord be magnified, just as You have declared:
<span class="reftext">18</span>‘<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> is slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion,<span class="fn">a</span>  forgiving iniquity and transgression. Yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished; He will visit the iniquity of the fathers upon their children to the third and fourth generation.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people, in keeping with the greatness of Your loving devotion, just as You have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.”
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Forgiveness and Judgment<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 1:34–40)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>“I have pardoned them as you requested,” <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> replied.
<span class="reftext">21</span>“Yet as surely as I live and as surely as the whole earth is filled with the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,
<span class="reftext">22</span>not one of the men who have seen My glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness—yet have tested Me and disobeyed Me these ten times—
<span class="reftext">23</span>not one will ever see the land that I swore to give their fathers. None of those who have treated Me with contempt will see it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>But because My servant Caleb has a different spirit and has followed Me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he has entered, and his descendants will inherit it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Now since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and head for the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea.<span class="fn">b</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses and Aaron,
<span class="reftext">27</span>“How long will this wicked congregation grumble against Me? I have heard the complaints that the Israelites are making against Me.
<span class="reftext">28</span>So tell them: As surely as I live, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, I will do to you exactly as I heard you say.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Your bodies will fall in this wilderness—all who were numbered in the census, everyone twenty years of age or older—because you have grumbled against Me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Surely none of you will enter the land in which I swore to settle you, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
<span class="reftext">31</span>But I will bring your children, whom you said would become plunder, into the land you have rejected—and they will enjoy it.
<span class="reftext">32</span>As for you, however, your bodies will fall in this wilderness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Your children will be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years, and they will suffer for your unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness.
<span class="reftext">34</span>In keeping with the forty days you spied out the land, you shall bear your guilt forty years—a year for each day—and you will experience My alienation.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this entire wicked congregation, which has conspired against Me. They will meet their end in the wilderness, and there they will die.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Plague on the Ten Spies</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>So the men Moses had sent to spy out the land, who had returned and made the whole congregation grumble against him by bringing out a bad report about the land—
<span class="reftext">37</span>those men who had brought out the bad report about the land—were struck down by a plague before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">38</span>Of those men who had gone to spy out the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh remained alive.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>And when Moses relayed these words to all the Israelites, the people mourned bitterly.
</p><p class="hdg">The Defeat at Hormah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 1:41–46)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Early the next morning they got up and went up toward the ridge of the hill country. “We have indeed sinned,” they said, “but we will go to the place <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has promised.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>But Moses said, “Why are you transgressing the commandment of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>? This will not succeed!
<span class="reftext">42</span>Do not go up, lest you be struck down by your enemies, because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is not among you.
<span class="reftext">43</span>For there the Amalekites and Canaanites will face you, and you will fall by the sword. Because you have turned away from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, He will not be with you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>But they dared to go up to the ridge of the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> moved from the camp.
<span class="reftext">45</span>Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that part of the hill country came down, attacked them, and routed them all the way to Hormah.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">chesed</i> are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as <i class="calibre6">loving devotion</i>; the range of meaning includes <i class="calibre6">love</i>, <i class="calibre6">goodness</i>, <i class="calibre6">kindness</i>, <i class="calibre6">faithfulness</i>, and <i class="calibre6">mercy</i>, as well as <i class="calibre6">loyalty to a covenant</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Sea of Reeds</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
