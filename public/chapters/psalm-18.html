Of David the servant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, who sang this song to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> on the day <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said: </p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>I love You, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, my strength.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Smoke rose from His nostrils, </p><p class="indent"> and consuming fire came from His mouth; </p><p class="indent"> glowing coals blazed forth.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The channels of the sea appeared, </p><p class="indent"> and the foundations of the world were exposed, </p><p class="indent1"> at Your rebuke, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, </p><p class="indent"> at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>He reached down from on high and took hold of me; </p><p class="indent"> He drew me out of deep waters.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">42</span>I ground them as dust in the face of the wind; </p><p class="indent"> I trampled them<span class="fn">d</span>  like mud in the streets.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">43</span>You have delivered me from the strife of the people; </p><p class="indent"> You have made me the head of nations; </p><p class="indent"> a people I had not known shall serve me.
