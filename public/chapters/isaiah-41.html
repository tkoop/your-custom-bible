</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Who has aroused one from the east </p><p class="indent"> and called him to his feet in righteousness<span class="fn">b</span>? </p><p class="indent1"> He hands nations over to him </p><p class="indent"> and subdues kings before him. </p><p class="indent1"> He turns them to dust with his sword, </p><p class="indent"> to windblown chaff with his bow.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>He pursues them, going on safely, </p><p class="indent"> hardly touching the path with his feet.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Who has performed this and carried it out, </p><p class="indent"> calling forth the generations from the beginning? </p><p class="indent1"> I, the LORD—the first and the last—</p><p class="indent"> I am He.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>The islands see and fear; </p><p class="indent"> the ends of the earth tremble. </p><p class="indent"> They approach and come forward.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Each one helps the other </p><p class="indent"> and says to his brother, “Be strong!”
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>The craftsman encourages the goldsmith, </p><p class="indent"> and he who wields the hammer </p><p class="indent"> cheers him who strikes the anvil, </p><p class="indent1"> saying of the welding, “It is good.” </p><p class="indent"> He nails it down so it will not be toppled.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>“But you, O Israel, My servant, </p><p class="indent"> Jacob, whom I have chosen, </p><p class="indent"> descendant of Abraham My friend—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>I brought you from the ends of the earth </p><p class="indent"> and called you from its farthest corners. </p><p class="indent1"> I said, ‘You are My servant.’ </p><p class="indent"> I have chosen and not rejected you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Do not fear, for I am with you; </p><p class="indent"> do not be afraid, for I am your God. </p><p class="indent1"> I will strengthen you; I will surely help you; </p><p class="indent"> I will uphold you with My right hand of righteousness.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>Behold, all who rage against you </p><p class="indent"> will be ashamed and disgraced; </p><p class="indent1"> those who contend with you </p><p class="indent"> will be reduced to nothing and will perish.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>You will seek them but will not find them. </p><p class="indent"> Those who wage war against you will come to nothing.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>For I am the LORD your God, </p><p class="indent"> who takes hold of your right hand </p><p class="indent1"> and tells you: Do not fear, </p><p class="indent"> I will help you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Do not fear, O worm of Jacob, </p><p class="indent"> O few men of Israel. </p><p class="indent1"> I will help you,” declares the LORD. </p><p class="indent">“Your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Behold, I will make you into a threshing sledge, </p><p class="indent"> new and sharp, with many teeth. </p><p class="indent1"> You will thresh the mountains and crush them, </p><p class="indent"> and reduce the hills to chaff.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>You will winnow them, and a wind will carry them away; </p><p class="indent"> a gale will scatter them. </p><p class="indent1"> But you will rejoice in the LORD; </p><p class="indent"> you will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>The poor and needy seek water, but there is none; </p><p class="indent"> their tongues are parched with thirst. </p><p class="indent1"> I, the LORD, will answer them; </p><p class="indent"> I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>I will open rivers on the barren heights, </p><p class="indent"> and fountains in the middle of the valleys. </p><p class="indent1"> I will turn the desert into a pool of water, </p><p class="indent"> and the dry land into flowing springs.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>I will plant cedars in the wilderness, </p><p class="indent"> acacias, myrtles, and olive trees. </p><p class="indent1"> I will set cypresses<span class="fn">c</span>  in the desert, </p><p class="indent"> elms and boxwood together,

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Tell us the things that are to come, </p><p class="indent"> so that we may know that you are gods. </p><p class="indent1"> Yes, do something good or evil, </p><p class="indent"> that we may look on together in dismay.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Behold, you are nothing </p><p class="indent"> and your work is of no value. </p><p class="indent"> Anyone who chooses you is detestable.
