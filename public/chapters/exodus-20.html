<font >You shall not make for yourself an idol in
the form of anything in the heavens above, on the earth below, or in
the waters beneath. You shall not bow down to them or worship them;
for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
the fathers on their children to the third and fourth generations of
those who hate Me, but showing loving devotion to a thousand
generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments. </font>

<font >Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it
holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh
day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God, on which you must not do any
work—neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or
maidservant or livestock, nor the foreigner within your gates. For in
six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all
that is in them, but on the seventh day He rested. Therefore the LORD
blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart as holy. </font>

<font >When all the people witnessed the thunder
and lightning, the sounding of the ram’s horn, and the mountain
enveloped in smoke, they trembled and stood at a distance. “Speak
to us yourself and we will listen,” they said to Moses. “But do
not let God speak to us, or we will die.” </font>

“<font >Do not be afraid,” Moses replied.

<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “This is
what you are to tell the Israelites: ‘You have seen for yourselves
that I have spoken to you from heaven. You are not to make any gods
alongside Me; you are not to make for yourselves gods of silver or
gold. </font>

<font >You are to make for Me an altar of earth,
and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and peace offerings, your
sheep and goats and cattle. In every place where I cause My name to
be remembered, I will come to you and bless you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if you make an altar of stones for Me,
you must not build it with stones shaped by tools; for if you use a
chisel on it, you will defile it. And you must not go up to My altar
on steps, lest your nakedness be exposed on it.’ </font>
