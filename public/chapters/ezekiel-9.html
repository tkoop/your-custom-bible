<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Execution of the Idolaters</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then I heard <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> call out in a loud voice, saying, “Draw near, O executioners of the city, each with a weapon of destruction in hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And I saw six men coming from the direction of the Upper <span class='cap'>Gate</span><span class='nocap'>gate</span><span class='bsb'>Gate</span>, which faces north, each with a weapon of slaughter in his hand. With them was another man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. And they came in and stood beside the bronze altar.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side.
<span class="reftext">4</span>“Go throughout the city of Jerusalem,” said <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “and put a mark on the foreheads of the men sighing and groaning over all the abominations committed there.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And as I listened, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said to the others, “Follow him through the city and start killing; do not show pity or spare anyone!
<span class="reftext">6</span>Slaughter the old men, the young men and maidens, the women and children; but do not go near anyone who has the mark. Now begin at <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> sanctuary.” </p><p class="reg1"> So they began with the elders who were before the temple.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> told them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth!” </p><p class="reg1"> So they went out and began killing throughout the city.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>While they were killing, I was left alone. And I fell facedown and cried out, “Oh, Lord GOD, when <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> pour out <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> wrath on Jerusalem, will <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> destroy the entire remnant of Israel?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>He replied, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of perversity. For they say, ‘<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> has forsaken the land; <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> does not see.’
<span class="reftext">10</span>But as for <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, I will not look on them with pity, nor will I spare them. I will bring their deeds down upon their own heads.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then the man clothed in linen with the writing kit at his side reported back, “I have done as <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> commanded.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
