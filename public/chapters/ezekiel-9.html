<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Execution of the Idolaters</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then I heard Him call out in a loud voice, saying, “Draw near, O executioners of the city, each with a weapon of destruction in hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And I saw six men coming from the direction of the Upper Gate, which faces north, each with a weapon of slaughter in his hand. With them was another man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. And they came in and stood beside the bronze altar.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then the glory of the God of Israel rose from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. And He called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side.
<span class="reftext">4</span>“Go throughout the city of Jerusalem,” said <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “and put a mark on the foreheads of the men sighing and groaning over all the abominations committed there.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And as I listened, He said to the others, “Follow him through the city and start killing; do not show pity or spare anyone!
<span class="reftext">6</span>Slaughter the old men, the young men and maidens, the women and children; but do not go near anyone who has the mark. Now begin at My sanctuary.” </p><p class="reg1"> So they began with the elders who were before the temple.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then He told them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth!” </p><p class="reg1"> So they went out and began killing throughout the city.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>While they were killing, I was left alone. And I fell facedown and cried out, “Oh, Lord GOD, when You pour out Your wrath on Jerusalem, will You destroy the entire remnant of Israel?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>He replied, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. The land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of perversity. For they say, ‘<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> has forsaken the land; <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> does not see.’
<span class="reftext">10</span>But as for Me, I will not look on them with pity, nor will I spare them. I will bring their deeds down upon their own heads.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then the man clothed in linen with the writing kit at his side reported back, “I have done as You commanded.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
