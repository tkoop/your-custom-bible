</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>When pride comes, disgrace follows, </p><p class="indent"> but with humility comes wisdom.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>The integrity of the upright guides them, </p><p class="indent"> but the perversity of the faithless destroys them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Riches are worthless in the day of wrath, </p><p class="indent"> but righteousness brings deliverance from death.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>The righteousness of the blameless directs their path, </p><p class="indent"> but the wicked fall by their own wickedness.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>The righteousness of the upright delivers them, </p><p class="indent"> but the faithless are trapped by their own desires.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>When the wicked man dies, his hope perishes, </p><p class="indent"> and the hope of his strength vanishes.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>The righteous man is delivered from trouble; </p><p class="indent"> in his place the wicked man goes in.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>With his mouth the ungodly man destroys his neighbour, </p><p class="indent"> but through knowledge the righteous are rescued.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>When the righteous thrive, the city rejoices, </p><p class="indent"> and when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>By the blessing of the upright a city is built up, </p><p class="indent"> but by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>Whoever shows contempt for his neighbour lacks judgment, </p><p class="indent"> but a man of understanding remains silent.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>A gossip reveals a secret, </p><p class="indent"> but a trustworthy person keeps a confidence.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>For lack of guidance, a nation falls, </p><p class="indent"> but with many counsellors comes deliverance.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>He who puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer, </p><p class="indent"> but the one who hates indebtedness is secure.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>A gracious woman attains honour, </p><p class="indent"> but ruthless men gain only wealth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>A kind man benefits himself, </p><p class="indent"> but a cruel man brings trouble on himself.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>The wicked man earns an empty wage, </p><p class="indent"> but he who sows righteousness reaps a true reward.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>Genuine righteousness leads to life, </p><p class="indent"> but the pursuit of evil brings death.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>The perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> but the blameless in their walk are His delight.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>Be assured that the wicked will not go unpunished, </p><p class="indent"> but the offspring of the righteous will escape.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout </p><p class="indent"> is a beautiful woman who lacks discretion.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>The desire of the righteous leads only to good, </p><p class="indent"> but the hope of the wicked brings wrath.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>One gives freely, yet gains even more; </p><p class="indent"> another withholds what is right, only to become poor.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>A generous soul will prosper, </p><p class="indent"> and he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>The people will curse the hoarder of grain, </p><p class="indent"> but blessing will crown the one who sells it.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>He who searches out good finds favour, </p><p class="indent"> but evil will come to him who seeks it.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">28</span>He who trusts in his riches will fall, </p><p class="indent"> but the righteous will thrive like foliage.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">29</span>He who brings trouble on his house will inherit the wind, </p><p class="indent"> and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">30</span>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, </p><p class="indent"> and he who wins souls is wise.
