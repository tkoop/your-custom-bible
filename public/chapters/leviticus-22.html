<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron
and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings that the
Israelites have consecrated to Me, so that they do not profane My
holy name. I am the LORD. </font>

<font >Tell them that for the generations to
come, if any of their descendants in a state of uncleanness
approaches the sacred offerings that the Israelites consecrate to the
LORD, that person must be cut off from My presence. I am the LORD. </font>

<font >If a descendant of Aaron has a skin
disease or a discharge, he may not eat the sacred offerings until he
is clean. Whoever touches anything defiled by a corpse or by a man
who has an emission of semen, or whoever touches a crawling creature
or a person that makes him unclean, whatever the uncleanness may be—
the man who touches any of these will remain unclean until evening.
He must not eat from the sacred offerings unless he has bathed
himself with water. </font>

<font >When the sun has set, he will become
clean, and then he may eat from the sacred offerings, for they are
his food. He must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild
animals, which would make him unclean. I am the LORD. The priests
must keep My charge, lest they bear the guilt and die because they
profane it. I am the LORD who sanctifies them. </font>

<font >No one outside a priest’s family may eat
the sacred offering, nor may the guest of a priest or his hired hand
eat it. But if a priest buys a slave with his own money, or if a
slave is born in his household, that slave may eat his food. </font>

<font >If the priest’s daughter is married to a
man other than a priest, she is not to eat of the sacred
contributions. But if a priest’s daughter with no children becomes
widowed or divorced and returns to her father’s house, she may
share her father’s food as in her youth. But no outsider may share
it. </font>

<font >If anyone eats a sacred offering in error,
he must add a fifth to its value and give the sacred offering to the
priest. The priests must not profane the sacred offerings that the
Israelites present to the LORD by allowing the people to eat the
sacred offerings and thus to bear the punishment for guilt. For I am
the LORD who sanctifies them.” </font>

<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and tell them, ‘Any man
of the house of Israel or any foreign resident who presents a gift
for a burnt offering to the LORD, whether to fulfill a vow or as a
freewill offering, must offer an unblemished male from the cattle,
sheep, or goats in order for it to be accepted on your behalf. You
must not present anything with a defect, because it will not be
accepted on your behalf. </font>

<font >When a man presents a peace offering to
the LORD from the herd or flock to fulfill a vow or as a freewill
offering, it must be without blemish or defect to be acceptable. You
are not to present to the LORD any animal that is blind, injured, or
maimed, or anything with a running sore, a festering rash, or a scab;
you must not put any of these on the altar as an offering made by
fire to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You may present as a freewill offering an
ox or sheep that has a deformed or stunted limb, but it is not
acceptable in fulfillment of a vow. You are not to present to the
LORD an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed, torn, or cut;
you are not to sacrifice them in your land. Neither you nor a
foreigner shall present food to your God from any such animal. They
will not be accepted on your behalf, because they are deformed and
flawed.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>

<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “When an
ox, a sheep, or a goat is born, it must remain with its mother for
seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as an
offering made by fire to the LORD. But you must not slaughter an ox
or a sheep on the same day as its young. </font>
