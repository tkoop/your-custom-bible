<span class="reftext">2</span>in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">3</span>In His own time He has made His word evident in the proclamation entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>To Titus, my true child in our common faith: </p><p class="reg1"> Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

<span class="reftext">6</span>An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife,<span class="fn">b</span>  having children who are believers and who are not open to accusation of indiscretion or insubordination.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>As God’s steward, an overseer must be above reproach—not self-absorbed, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not greedy for money.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Instead, he must be hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined.
<span class="reftext">9</span>He must hold firmly to the faithful word as it was taught, so that he can encourage others by sound teaching and refute those who contradict it.
</p><p class="hdg">Correcting False Teachers<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Timothy 1:3–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>For many are rebellious and full of empty talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision,
<span class="reftext">11</span>who must be silenced. For the sake of dishonorable gain, they undermine entire households and teach things they should not.
<span class="reftext">12</span>As one of their own prophets has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sternly, so that they will be sound in the faith
<span class="reftext">14</span>and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of men who have rejected the truth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>To the pure, all things are pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure. Indeed, both their minds and their consciences are defiled.
<span class="reftext">16</span>They profess to know God, but by their actions they deny Him. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good deed.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">before times eternal</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">faithful to his wife</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> This quote, also known as the Epimenides paradox, has been attributed to the Cretan philosopher Epimenides of Knossos.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
