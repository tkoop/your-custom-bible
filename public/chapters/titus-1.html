Jesus Christ for the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of
the truth that leads to godliness, in the hope of eternal life, which
God, who cannot lie, promised before time began. In His own time He

<font >The reason I left you in Crete was that
you would set in order what was unfinished and appoint elders in
every town, as I directed you. An elder must be blameless, the
husband of but one wife, having children who are believers and who
are not open to accusation of indiscretion or insubordination. </font>

<font >As God’s steward, an overseer must be
above reproach—not self-absorbed, not quick-tempered, not given to
drunkenness, not violent, not greedy for money. Instead, he must be
hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and
disciplined. He must hold firmly to the faithful word as it was
taught, so that he can encourage others by sound teaching and refute
those who contradict it. </font>

<font >For many are rebellious and full of empty
talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision, who must be
silenced. For the sake of dishonorable gain, they undermine entire
households and teach things they should not. As one of their own
prophets has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy
gluttons.” </font>

<font >This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke
them sternly, so that they will be sound in the faith and will pay no
attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of men who have rejected
the truth. </font>

<font >To the pure, all things are pure; but to
the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure. Indeed, both their
minds and their consciences are defiled. They profess to know God,
but by their actions they deny Him. They are detestable, disobedient,
and unfit for any good deed. </font>
