<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Excellence of Wisdom</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>Does not wisdom call out, </p><p class="indent"> and understanding raise her voice?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>On the heights overlooking the road, </p><p class="indent"> at the crossroads she takes her stand.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Beside the gates to the city, </p><p class="indent"> at the entrances she cries out:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>“To you, O men, I call out, </p><p class="indent"> and my cry is to the sons of men.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>O simple ones, learn to be shrewd; </p><p class="indent"> O fools, gain understanding.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Listen, for I speak of noble things, </p><p class="indent"> and the opening of my lips will reveal right.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>For my mouth will speak the truth, </p><p class="indent"> and wickedness is detestable to my lips.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>All the words of my mouth are righteous; </p><p class="indent"> none are crooked or perverse.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>They are all plain to the discerning, </p><p class="indent"> and upright to those who find knowledge.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Receive my instruction instead of silver, </p><p class="indent"> and knowledge rather than pure gold.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>For wisdom is more precious than rubies, </p><p class="indent"> and nothing you desire compares with her.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence, </p><p class="indent"> and I find knowledge and discretion.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>To fear the LORD is to hate evil; </p><p class="indent"> I hate arrogant pride, evil conduct, and perverse speech.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Counsel and sound <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> are mine; </p><p class="indent"> I have insight and strength.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>By me kings reign, </p><p class="indent"> and rulers enact just laws;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>By me princes rule, </p><p class="indent"> and all nobles who govern justly.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>I love those who love me, </p><p class="indent"> and those who seek me early shall find me.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>My fruit is better than gold, pure gold, </p><p class="indent"> and my harvest surpasses choice silver.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>I walk in the way of righteousness, </p><p class="indent"> along the paths of justice,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>bestowing wealth on those who love me </p><p class="indent"> and making their treasuries full.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>The LORD created me as His first course,<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent"> before His works of old.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>From everlasting I was established, </p><p class="indent"> from the beginning, before the earth began.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>When there were no watery depths, I was brought forth, </p><p class="indent"> when no springs were overflowing with water.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Before the mountains were settled, </p><p class="indent"> before the hills, I was brought forth,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>before He made the land or fields, </p><p class="indent"> or any of the dust of the earth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>I was there when He established the heavens, </p><p class="indent"> when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>when He established the clouds above, </p><p class="indent"> when the fountains of the deep gushed forth,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>when He set a boundary for the sea, </p><p class="indent"> so that the waters would not surpass His command, </p><p class="indent"> when He marked out the foundations of the earth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Then I was a skilled craftsman at His side, </p><p class="indent"> and His delight<span class="fn">d</span>  day by day, </p><p class="indent"> rejoicing always in His presence.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>I was rejoicing in His whole world, </p><p class="indent"> delighting together in the sons of men.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">32</span>Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, </p><p class="indent"> for blessed are those who keep my ways.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Listen to instruction and be wise; </p><p class="indent"> do not ignore it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Blessed is the man who listens to me, </p><p class="indent"> watching daily at my doors, </p><p class="indent"> waiting at the posts of my doorway.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>For whoever finds me finds life </p><p class="indent"> and obtains the <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> of the LORD.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">36</span>But he who fails to find me harms himself; </p><p class="indent"> all who hate me love death.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">instruct your minds</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Some Hebrew manuscripts and LXX <i class="calibre6">who govern the earth</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">The LORD possessed me at the beginning of His way</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">filled with His delight</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
