<font >So I made up my mind not to make another
painful visit to you. For if I grieve you, who is left to cheer me
but those whom I have grieved? I wrote as I did so that on my arrival
I would not be saddened by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had
confidence in all of you, that you would share my joy. For through
many tears I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart,
not to grieve you but to let you know how much I love you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if anyone has caused grief, he has not
grieved me but all of youâ€”to some degree, not to overstate it. The
punishment imposed on him by the majority is sufficient for him. So
instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be
overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. Therefore I urge you to reaffirm
your love for him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >My purpose in writing you was to see if
you would stand the test and be obedient in everything. If you
forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And if I have forgiven anything,
I have forgiven it in the presence of Christ for your sake, in order
that Satan should not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his
schemes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now when I went to Troas to preach the
gospel of Christ and a door stood open for me in the Lord, I had no
peace in my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So
I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But thanks be to God, who always leads us
triumphantly as captives in Christ and through us spreads everywhere
the fragrance of the knowledge of Him. For we are to God the sweet
aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are
perishing. To the one, we are an odor of death and demise; to the
other, a fragrance that brings life. And who is qualified for such a
task? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For we are not like so many others, who
peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we
speak before God with sincerity, as men sent from God. </font>
