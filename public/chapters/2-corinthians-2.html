<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Reaffirm Your Love</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>So I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For if I grieve <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, who is left to cheer me but those whom I have grieved?
<span class="reftext">3</span>I wrote as I did so that on my arrival I would not be saddened by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> would share my joy.
<span class="reftext">4</span>For through many tears I wrote <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> out of great distress and anguish of heart, not to grieve <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> but to let <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> know how much I love you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me but all of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>—to some degree, not to overstate it.
<span class="reftext">6</span>The punishment imposed on him by the majority is sufficient for him.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So instead, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore I urge <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to reaffirm your love for him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>My purpose in writing you was to see if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> would stand the test and be obedient in everything.
<span class="reftext">10</span>If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And if I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven it in the presence of Christ for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sake,
<span class="reftext">11</span>in order that Satan should not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.
</p><p class="hdg">Triumph in Christ</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and a door stood open for me in the Lord,
<span class="reftext">13</span>I had no peace in my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But thanks be to God, who always leads us triumphantly as captives in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For we are to God the sweet aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.
<span class="reftext">16</span>To the one, we are an <span class='spell ca'>odour</span><span class='spell gb'>odour</span><span class='spell us'>odor</span> of death and demise; to the other, a fragrance that brings life.<span class="fn">a</span>  And who is qualified for such a task?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>For we are not like so many others, who peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as men sent from God.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">To the one, indeed, an aroma from death to death; but to the other, an aroma from life to life.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
