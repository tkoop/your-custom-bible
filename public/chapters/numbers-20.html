<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Water from the Rock<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 17:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the first month, the whole congregation of Israel entered the <span class='cap'>Wilderness</span><span class='nocap'>wilderness</span> of Zin and stayed in Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Now there was no water for the congregation, so they gathered against Moses and Aaron.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The people quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had perished with our brothers before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>!
<span class="reftext">4</span>Why have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> brought <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s assembly into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die here?
<span class="reftext">5</span>Why have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> led us up out of Egypt to bring us to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain, figs, vines, or pomegranates—and there is no water to drink!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the entrance to the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span>. They fell facedown, and the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> appeared to them.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">8</span>“Take the staff and assemble the congregation. You and your brother Aaron are to speak to the rock while they watch, and it will pour out its water. You will bring out water from the rock and provide drink for the congregation and their livestock.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So Moses took the staff from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s presence, just as he had been commanded.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Then Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock, and Moses said to them, “Listen now, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> rebels, must we bring <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> water out of this rock?”
<span class="reftext">11</span>Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff, so that a great amount of water gushed out, and the congregation and their livestock were able to drink.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses and Aaron, “Because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> did not trust <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to show <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> holiness in the sight of the Israelites, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will not bring this assembly into the land that I have given them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>These were the waters of Meribah,<span class="fn">a</span>  where the Israelites quarreled with <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> showed <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> holiness among them.
</p><p class="hdg">Edom Refuses Passage</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>From Kadesh, Moses sent messengers to tell the king of Edom, “This is what your brother Israel says: You know all the hardship that has befallen us,
<span class="reftext">15</span>how our fathers went down to Egypt, where we lived many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers,
<span class="reftext">16</span>and when we cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> heard our voice, sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt. </p><p class="reg1"> Now look, we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Please let us pass through your land. We will not cut through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will stay on the King’s Highway; we will not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>But Edom answered, “You may not travel through our land, or we will come out and confront you with the sword.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>“We will stay on the main road,” the Israelites replied, “and if we or our herds drink your water, we will pay for it. There will be no problem; only let us pass through on foot.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>But Edom insisted, “You may not pass through.” And they came out to confront the Israelites with a large army and a strong hand.
<span class="reftext">21</span>So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through their territory, and Israel turned away from them.
</p><p class="hdg">The Death of Aaron</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>After they had set out from Kadesh, the whole congregation of Israel came to Mount Hor.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And at Mount Hor, near the border of the land of Edom, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses and Aaron,
<span class="reftext">24</span>“Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will not enter the land that I have given the Israelites, because both of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> rebelled against <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> command at the waters of Meribah.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Remove Aaron’s priestly garments and put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron will be gathered to his people and will die there.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>So Moses did as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded, and they climbed Mount Hor in the sight of the whole congregation.
<span class="reftext">28</span>After Moses had removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
<span class="reftext">29</span>When the whole congregation saw that Aaron had died, the entire house of Israel mourned for him thirty days.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Meribah</i> means <i class="calibre6">quarreling</i>; also in verse 24; see Exodus 17:7.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
