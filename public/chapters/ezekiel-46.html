“<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘The
gate of the inner court that faces east must be kept shut during the
six days of work, but on the Sabbath day and on the day of the New
Moon it shall be opened. The prince is to enter from the outside
through the portico of the gateway and stand by the gatepost, while
the priests sacrifice his burnt offerings and peace offerings. He is
to bow in worship at the threshold of the gate and then depart, but
the gate must not be shut until evening. On the Sabbaths and New
Moons the people of the land are also to bow in worship before the
LORD at the entrance to that gateway. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The burnt offering that the prince
presents to the LORD on the Sabbath day shall be six unblemished male
lambs and an unblemished ram. The grain offering with the ram shall
be one ephah, and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much
as he is able, along with a hin of oil per ephah. On the day of the
New Moon he shall offer a young, unblemished bull, six lambs, and a
ram without blemish. He is to provide a grain offering of an ephah
with the bull, an ephah with the ram, and as much as he is able with
the lambs, along with a hin of oil per ephah. When the prince enters,
he shall go in through the portico of the gateway, and he shall go
out the same way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the people of the land come before
the LORD at the appointed feasts, whoever enters by the north gate to
worship must go out by the south gate, and whoever enters by the
south gate must go out by the north gate. No one is to return through
the gate by which he entered, but each must go out by the opposite
gate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the people enter, the prince shall go
in with them, and when they leave, he shall leave. At the festivals
and appointed feasts, the grain offering shall be an ephah with a
bull, an ephah with a ram, and as much as one is able to give with
the lambs, along with a hin of oil per ephah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the prince makes a freewill offering
to the LORD, whether a burnt offering or a peace offering, the gate
facing east must be opened for him. He is to offer his burnt offering
or peace offering just as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall
go out, and the gate must be closed after he goes out. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And you shall provide an unblemished
year-old lamb as a daily burnt offering to the LORD; you are to offer
it every morning. You are also to provide with it every morning a
grain offering of a sixth of an ephah with a third of a hin of oil to
moisten the fine flour—a grain offering to the LORD. This is a
permanent statute. Thus they shall provide the lamb, the grain
offering, and the oil every morning as a regular burnt offering.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘If the
prince gives a gift to any of his sons as an inheritance, it will
belong to his descendants. It will become their property by
inheritance. But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of
his servants, it will belong to that servant until the year of
freedom; then it will revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs
only to his sons; it shall be theirs. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The prince must not take any of the
inheritance of the people by evicting them from their property. He is
to provide an inheritance for his sons from his own property, so that
none of My people will be displaced from his property.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the man brought me through the
entrance at the side of the gate into the holy chambers facing north,
which belonged to the priests, and he showed me a place there at the
far western end and said to me, “This is the place where the
priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where
they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them
into the outer court and transmit holiness to the people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then he brought me into the outer court
and led me around to its four corners, and I saw a separate court in
each of its corners. In the four corners of the outer court there
were enclosed courts, each forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide.
Each of the four corner areas had the same dimensions. Around the
inside of each of the four courts was a row of masonry with ovens
built at the base of the walls on all sides. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And he said to me, “These are the
kitchens where those who minister at the temple will cook the
sacrifices offered by the people.” </font>
