<font ><b>Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah’s
reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked and captured all the
fortified cities of Judah. And the king of Assyria sent the
Rabshakeh, with a great army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at
Jerusalem. And he stopped by the aqueduct of the upper pool, on the
road to the Launderer’s Field. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace
administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder,
went out to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Rabshakeh said to them, “Tell
Hezekiah that this is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says:
What is the basis of this confidence of yours? You claim to have a
strategy and strength for war, but these are empty words. In whom are
you now trusting, that you have rebelled against me? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Look now, you are trusting in Egypt, that
splintered reed of a staff that will pierce the hand of anyone who
leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is He not
the One whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to
Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before this altar’? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now, therefore, make a bargain with my
master, the king of Assyria. I will give you two thousand horses—if
you can put riders on them! For how can you repel a single officer
among the least of my master’s servants when you depend on Egypt
for chariots and horsemen? So now, was it apart from the LORD that I
have come up against this land to destroy it? The LORD Himself said
to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the
Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we
understand it. Do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the
people on the wall.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the Rabshakeh replied, “Has my
master sent me to speak these words only to you and your master, and
not to the men sitting on the wall, who are destined with you to eat
their own dung and drink their own urine?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out
loudly in Hebrew: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of
Assyria! This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you,
for he cannot deliver you. Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust
in the LORD when he says, ‘The LORD will surely deliver us; this
city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is
what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me.
Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig
tree, and drink water from his own cistern, until I come and take you
away to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land
of bread and vineyards. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he
says, ‘The LORD will deliver us.’ Has the god of any nation ever
delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are
the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have
they delivered Samaria from my hand? Who among all the gods of these
lands has delivered his land from my hand? How then can the LORD
deliver Jerusalem from my hand?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the people remained silent and did not
answer a word, for Hezekiah had commanded, “Do not answer him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Hilkiah’s son Eliakim the palace
administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Asaph’s son Joah the recorder
came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they relayed to him the
words of the Rabshakeh. </font>
