<font >Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him
flogged. The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns, set it on
His head, and dressed Him in a purple robe. And they went up to Him
again and again, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping
Him in the face. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Once again Pilate came out and said to the
Jews, “Look, I am bringing Him out to you to let you know that I
find no basis for a charge against Him.” When Jesus came out
wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them,
“Here is the man!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >As soon as the chief priests and officers
saw Him, they shouted, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >You take Him and crucify Him,” Pilate
replied, “for I find no basis for a charge against Him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >We have a law,” answered the Jews,
“and according to that law He must die, because He declared Himself
to be the Son of God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Pilate heard this statement, he was
even more afraid, and he went back into the Praetorium. “Where are
You from?” he asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But Jesus gave no answer. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Pilate said to Him, “Do You refuse to
speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You and
authority to crucify You?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“You
would have no authority over Me if it were not given to you from
above. Therefore the one who handed Me over to you is guilty of
greater sin.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >From then on, Pilate tried to release Him,
but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this man, you are no
friend of Caesar. Anyone who declares himself a king is defying
Caesar.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Pilate heard these words, he brought
Jesus out and sat on the judgment seat at a place called the Stone
Pavement, which in Hebrew is Gabbatha. It was the day of Preparation
for the Passover, about the sixth hour. And Pilate said to the Jews,
“Here is your King!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >At this, they shouted, “Away with Him!
Away with Him! Crucify Him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >Shall I crucify your King?” Pilate
asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >We have no king but Caesar,” replied
the chief priests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be
crucified, and the soldiers took Him away. Carrying His own cross, He
went out to The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called
Golgotha. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >There they crucified Him, and with Him two
others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Pilate also had a notice posted on the
cross. It read: </font>
</p>
<p class="western" align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<span style="text-transform: uppercase"><font >JESUS
OF NAZARETH, <br/>
THE KING OF THE JEWS.</font></span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Many of the Jews read this sign, because
the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was
written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. So the chief priests of the Jews
said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but only
that He said, <font color="#a80000">‘I am the King of the Jews.’</font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Pilate answered, “What I have written, I
have written.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When the soldiers had crucified Jesus,
they divided His garments into four parts, one for each soldier, with
the tunic remaining. It was seamless, woven in one piece from top to
bottom. So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it. Instead,
let us cast lots to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill the
Scripture: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >They divided My garments among them, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >and cast lots for My clothing.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So that is what the soldiers did. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Near the cross of Jesus stood His mother
and her sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary
Magdalene. When Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved
standing nearby, He said to His mother, <font color="#a80000">“Woman,
here is your son.”</font> Then He said to the disciple, <font color="#a80000">“Here
is your mother.”</font> So from that hour, this disciple took her
into his home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >After this, knowing that everything had
now been accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture, Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“I
am thirsty.”</font> A jar of sour wine was sitting there. So they
soaked a sponge in the wine, put it on a stalk of hyssop, and lifted
it to His mouth. When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, <font color="#a80000">“It
is finished.”</font> And bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >It was the day of Preparation, and the
next day was a High Sabbath. In order that the bodies would not
remain on the cross during the Sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate to have
the legs broken and the bodies removed. So the soldiers came and
broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus,
and those of the other. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But when they came to Jesus and saw that
He was already dead, they did not break His legs. Instead, one of the
soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and
water flowed out. The one who saw it has testified to this, and his
testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth, so that you
also may believe. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now these things happened so that the
Scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of His bones will be
broken.” And, as another Scripture says: “They will look on the
One they have pierced.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Afterward, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a
disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate
to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, so
he came and removed His body. Nicodemus, who had previously come to
Jesus at night, also brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about
seventy-five pounds. So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in
linen cloths with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now there was a garden in the place where
Jesus was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had
yet been laid. And because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and
the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus there. </font>
