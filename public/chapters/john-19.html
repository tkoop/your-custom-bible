<span class="reftext">2</span>The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns, set it on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> head, and dressed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in a purple robe.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And they went up to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> again and again, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in the face.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Once again Pilate came out and said to the Jews, “Look, I am bringing <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> out to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to let <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> know that I find no basis for a charge against <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.”
<span class="reftext">5</span>When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>As soon as the chief priests and officers saw <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, they shouted, “Crucify <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>! Crucify <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>!” </p><p class="reg1">“<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> take <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and crucify <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>,” Pilate replied, “for I find no basis for a charge against <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>“We have a law,” answered the Jews, “and according to that law <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> must die, because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> declared <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> to be the Son of God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid,
<span class="reftext">9</span>and he went back into the Praetorium. “Where are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> from?” he asked. </p><p class="reg1"> But Jesus gave no answer.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So Pilate said to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Do <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> refuse to speak to me? Do <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> not know that I have authority to release <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> and authority to crucify <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Jesus answered, <span>“You would have no authority over <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> over to you is guilty of greater sin.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>From then on, Pilate tried to release <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who declares himself a king is defying Caesar.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat on the <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> seat at a place called the <span class='cap'>Stone</span><span class='nocap'>stone</span> Pavement, which in Hebrew<span class="fn">a</span>  is Gabbatha.
<span class="reftext">14</span>It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour.<span class="fn">b</span>  And Pilate said to the Jews, “Here is <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> King!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>At this, they shouted, “Away with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>!

</p><p class="hdg">The Crucifixion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 22:1–31; Matthew 27:32–44; Mark 15:21–32; Luke 23:26–43)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified, and the soldiers took <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> away.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Carrying <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own cross, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> went out to <span class='cap'>The</span><span class='nocap'>the</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span> of the <span class='cap'>Skull</span><span class='nocap'>skull</span>, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>There they crucified <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, and with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Pilate also had a notice posted on the cross. It read: </p><p class="reg1"></p><div class="inscrip1"> JESUS OF NAZARETH, <br class="calibre2"> THE KING OF THE JEWS.</div>
<p class="calibre3"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.
<span class="reftext">21</span>So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but only that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said, <span>‘I am the King of the Jews.’</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> garments into four parts, one for each soldier, with the tunic remaining. It was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.
<span class="reftext">24</span>So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it. Instead, let us cast lots to see who will get it.” This was to <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> the <span class='cap'>Scripture</span><span class='nocap'>scripture</span>: </p><p class="indent1stline">“They divided <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> garments among them, </p><p class="indent"> and cast lots for <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> clothing.”<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> So that is what the soldiers did.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Near the cross of Jesus stood <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mother and her sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene.
<span class="reftext">26</span>When Jesus saw <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mother and the disciple whom <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> loved standing nearby, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mother, <span>“Woman, here is your son.”</span>
<span class="reftext">27</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said to the disciple, <span>“Here is your mother.”</span> So from that hour, this disciple took her into his home.

<span class="reftext">29</span>A jar of sour wine<span class="fn">e</span>  was sitting there. So they soaked a sponge in the wine, put it on a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mouth.<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">30</span>When Jesus had received the sour wine, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said, <span>“It is finished.”</span> And bowing <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> head, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> yielded up <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> spirit.

In order that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.
<span class="reftext">32</span>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and those of the other.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>But when they came to Jesus and saw that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was already dead, they did not break <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> legs.
<span class="reftext">34</span>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out.
<span class="reftext">35</span>The one who saw it has testified to this, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> also may believe.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Now these things happened so that the <span class='cap'>Scripture</span><span class='nocap'>scripture</span> would be fulfilled: “Not one of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> bones will be broken.”<span class="fn">g</span>
