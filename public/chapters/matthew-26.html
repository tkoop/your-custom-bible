<font ><b>The Last Supper</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus had finished saying all these
things, He told His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“You know that
the Passover is two days away, and the Son of Man will be handed over
to be crucified.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time the chief priests and elders
of the people assembled in the courtyard of the high priest, whose
name was Caiaphas, and they conspired to arrest Jesus covertly and
kill Him. “But not during the feast,” they said, “or there may
be a riot among the people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of
Simon the Leper, a woman came to Him with an alabaster jar of
expensive perfume, which she poured on His head as He reclined at the
table. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the disciples saw this, they were
indignant and asked, “Why this waste? This perfume could have been
sold at a high price, and the money given to the poor.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Aware of this, Jesus asked, <font color="#a80000">“Why
are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful deed to Me.
The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have
Me. By pouring this perfume on Me, she has prepared My body for
burial. Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached in all the
world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then one of the Twelve, the one called
Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and asked, “What are you
willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?” And they set out for
him thirty pieces of silver. So from then on Judas looked for an
opportunity to betray Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the first day of the Feast of
Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do
You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He answered, <font color="#a80000">“Go
into the city to a certain man and tell him that the Teacher says,
‘My time is near. I will keep the Passover with My disciples at
your house.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font color="#880000"> </font></font><font color="#a80000">”</font>
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the
Passover. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When evening came, Jesus was reclining
with the twelve disciples. And while they were eating, He said to
them, <font color="#a80000">“Truly I tell you, one of you will
betray Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They were deeply grieved and began to ask
Him one after another, “Surely not I, Lord?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“The
one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with Me will betray Me. The
Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that
man by whom He is betrayed. It would be better for him if he had not
been born.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Judas, who would betray Him, said,
“Surely not I, Rabbi?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“You
have said it yourself.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While they were eating, Jesus took bread,
spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying,
<font color="#a80000">“Take and eat; this is My body.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and
gave it to them, saying, <font color="#a80000">“Drink from it, all
of you. This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for
many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink of
this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it
anew with you in My Father’s kingdom.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when they had sung a hymn, they went
out to the Mount of Olives. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“This
very night you will all fall away on account of Me. For it is
written:</font> </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >I will strike the
Shepherd, </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >and the sheep of the
flock will be scattered.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But after I have
risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter said to Him, “Even if all fall
away on account of You, I never will.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Truly I tell
you,”</font> Jesus declared, <font color="#a80000">“this very
night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter replied, “Even if I have to die
with You, I will never deny You.” And all the other disciples said
the same thing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Jesus went with His disciples
to a place called Gethsemane, and He told them, <font color="#a80000">“Sit
here while I go over there and pray.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He took with Him Peter and the two sons of
Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed. Then He said
to them, <font color="#a80000">“My soul is consumed with sorrow to
the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Going a little farther, He fell facedown
and prayed, <font color="#a80000">“My Father, if it is possible,
let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You will.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus returned to the disciples and
found them sleeping. <font color="#a80000">“Were you not able to
keep watch with Me for one hour?”</font> He asked Peter. <font color="#a80000">“Watch
and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit
is willing, but the body is weak.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A second time He went away and prayed, <font color="#a80000">“My
Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it, may Your will be
done.”</font> And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping—for
their eyes were heavy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So He left them and went away once more
and prayed a third time, saying the same thing. Then He returned to
the disciples and said, <font color="#a80000">“Are you still
sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us go! See, My betrayer
is approaching!”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one
of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with
swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the
people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the betrayer had arranged a signal
with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him.” Going
directly to Jesus, he said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Friend,”</font>
Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“do what you came for.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the men stepped forward, seized
Jesus, and arrested Him. At this, one of Jesus’ companions drew his
sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Put your sword
back in its place,”</font> Jesus said to him. <font color="#a80000">“For
all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Are you not aware that
I can call on My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more
than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be
fulfilled that say it must happen this way?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Jesus said to the crowd,
<font color="#a80000">“Have you come out with swords and clubs to
arrest Me as you would an outlaw? Every day I sat teaching in the
temple courts, and you did not arrest Me. But this has all happened
so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then all the disciples deserted Him and
fled. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away
to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and
elders had gathered. But Peter followed Him at a distance, right up
to the courtyard of the high priest. And he went in and sat down with
the guards to see the outcome. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the chief priests and the whole
Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put
Him to death. But they did not find any, though many false witnesses
came forward. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Finally two came forward and declared,
“This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and
rebuild it in three days.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the high priest stood up and asked Him,
“Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus remained silent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the high priest said to Him, “I
charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the
Christ, the Son of God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >You have said it
yourself,”</font> Jesus answered. <font color="#a80000">“But I
say to all of you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at
the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, the high priest tore his clothes
and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more
witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. What do you
think?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >He deserves to die,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they spit in His face and struck Him.
Others slapped Him and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit You?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, Peter was sitting out in the
courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him. “You also were with
Jesus the Galilean,” she said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But he denied it before them all: “I do
not know what you are talking about.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Peter had gone out to the gateway,
another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This
man was with Jesus of Nazareth.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And again he denied it with an oath: “I
do not know the man!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After a little while, those standing
nearby came up to Peter. “Surely you are one of them,” they said,
“for your accent gives you away.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that he began to curse and swear to
them, “I do not know the man!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And immediately a rooster crowed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus
had spoken: <font color="#a80000">“Before the rooster crows, you
will deny Me three times.”</font> And he went outside and wept
bitterly. </font>
