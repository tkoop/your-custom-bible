<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jesus had finished saying all these
things, He told His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“You know that
the Passover is two days away, and the Son of Man will be handed over
to be crucified.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time the chief priests and elders
of the people assembled in the courtyard of the high priest, whose
name was Caiaphas, and they conspired to arrest Jesus covertly and
kill Him. “But not during the feast,” they said, “or there may
be a riot among the people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of
Simon the Leper, a woman came to Him with an alabaster jar of
expensive perfume, which she poured on His head as He reclined at the
table. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the disciples saw this, they were
indignant and asked, “Why this waste? This perfume could have been
sold at a high price, and the money given to the poor.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Aware of this, Jesus asked, <font color="#a80000">“Why
are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful deed to Me.
The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have
Me. By pouring this perfume on Me, she has prepared My body for
burial. Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached in all the
world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then one of the Twelve, the one called
Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and asked, “What are you
willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?” And they set out for
him thirty pieces of silver. So from then on Judas looked for an
opportunity to betray Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the first day of the Feast of
Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do
You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He answered, <font color="#a80000">“Go

your house.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font color="#880000"> </font></font><font color="#a80000">”</font>
So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the
Passover. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When evening came, Jesus was reclining
with the twelve disciples. And while they were eating, He said to
them, <font color="#a80000">“Truly I tell you, one of you will
betray Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They were deeply grieved and began to ask
Him one after another, “Surely not I, Lord?” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“The
one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with Me will betray Me. The
Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that
man by whom He is betrayed. It would be better for him if he had not
been born.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Judas, who would betray Him, said,

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While they were eating, Jesus took bread,
spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying,
<font color="#a80000">“Take and eat; this is My body.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and
gave it to them, saying, <font color="#a80000">“Drink from it, all
of you. This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for
many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink of
this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it
anew with you in My Father’s kingdom.”</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when they had sung a hymn, they went

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Peter said to Him, “Even if all fall

<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Truly I tell

night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Peter replied, “Even if I have to die
with You, I will never deny You.” And all the other disciples said
the same thing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Jesus went with His disciples
to a place called Gethsemane, and He told them, <font color="#a80000">“Sit
here while I go over there and pray.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He took with Him Peter and the two sons of
Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed. Then He said
to them, <font color="#a80000">“My soul is consumed with sorrow to
the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Going a little farther, He fell facedown
and prayed, <font color="#a80000">“My Father, if it is possible,
let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You will.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus returned to the disciples and
found them sleeping. <font color="#a80000">“Were you not able to
keep watch with Me for one hour?”</font> He asked Peter. <font color="#a80000">“Watch
and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit
is willing, but the body is weak.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">A second time He went away and prayed, <font color="#a80000">“My
Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it, may Your will be
done.”</font> And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping—for
their eyes were heavy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So He left them and went away once more
and prayed a third time, saying the same thing. Then He returned to
the disciples and said, <font color="#a80000">“Are you still
sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us go! See, My betrayer
is approaching!”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one
of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with
swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the
people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the betrayer had arranged a signal
with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him.” Going
directly to Jesus, he said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him. </font>

<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Friend,”</font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the men stepped forward, seized
Jesus, and arrested Him. At this, one of Jesus’ companions drew his
sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Put your sword
back in its place,”</font> Jesus said to him. <font color="#a80000">“For
all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Are you not aware that
I can call on My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more
than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be
fulfilled that say it must happen this way?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Jesus said to the crowd,
<font color="#a80000">“Have you come out with swords and clubs to
arrest Me as you would an outlaw? Every day I sat teaching in the
temple courts, and you did not arrest Me. But this has all happened
so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all the disciples deserted Him and
fled. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away
to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and
elders had gathered. But Peter followed Him at a distance, right up
to the courtyard of the high priest. And he went in and sat down with
the guards to see the outcome. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the chief priests and the whole
Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put
Him to death. But they did not find any, though many false witnesses
came forward. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Finally two came forward and declared,
“This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and

</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the high priest stood up and asked Him,
“Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?” </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the high priest said to Him, “I
charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the
Christ, the Son of God.” </font>

<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You have said it
yourself,”</font> Jesus answered. <font color="#a80000">“But I
say to all of you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at
the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At this, the high priest tore his clothes
and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more
witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. What do you
think?” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">He deserves to die,” they answered. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they spit in His face and struck Him.
Others slapped Him and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit You?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile, Peter was sitting out in the
courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him. “You also were with
Jesus the Galilean,” she said. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Peter had gone out to the gateway,
another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
