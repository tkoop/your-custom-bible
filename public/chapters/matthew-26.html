<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Plot to Kill Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 14:1–2; Luke 22:1–2; John 11:45–57)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When Jesus had finished saying all these things, He told His disciples,
<span><span class="reftext">2</span>“You know that the Passover is two days away, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>At that time the chief priests and elders of the people assembled in the courtyard of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,
<span class="reftext">4</span>and they conspired to arrest Jesus covertly and kill Him.
<span class="reftext">5</span>“But not during the feast,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Anointed at Bethany<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 14:3–9; Luke 7:36–50; John 12:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper,<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">7</span>a woman came to Him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume, which she poured on His head as He reclined at the table.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When the disciples saw this, they were indignant and asked, “Why this waste?
<span class="reftext">9</span>This perfume could have been sold at a high price, and the money given to the poor.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Aware of this, Jesus asked, <span>“Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful deed to Me.
<span class="reftext">11</span>The poor you will always have with you,<span class="fn">b</span>  but you will not always have Me.
<span class="reftext">12</span>By pouring this perfume on Me, she has prepared My body for burial.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 14:10–11; Luke 22:3–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests
<span class="reftext">15</span>and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?” And they set out for him thirty pieces of silver.
<span class="reftext">16</span>So from then on Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus.
</p><p class="hdg">Preparing the Passover<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 14:12–16; Luke 22:7–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,<span class="fn">c</span>  the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>He answered, <span>“Go into the city to a certain man and tell him that the Teacher says, ‘My time is near. I will keep the Passover with My disciples at your house.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</span>
<span class="reftext">19</span>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
</p><p class="hdg">The Last Supper<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 14:17–26; Luke 22:14–23; 1 Corinthians 11:17–34)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>When evening came, Jesus was reclining with the twelve disciples.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And while they were eating, He said to them, <span>“Truly I tell you, one of you will betray Me.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>They were deeply grieved and began to ask Him one after another, “Surely not I, Lord?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Jesus answered, <span>“The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with Me will betray Me.
<span class="reftext">24</span>The Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed. It would be better for him if he had not been born.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then Judas, who would betray Him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” </p><p class="reg1"> Jesus answered, <span>“You have said it yourself.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, <span>“Take and eat; this is My body.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, <span>“Drink from it, all of you.
<span class="reftext">28</span>This is My blood of the covenant,<span class="fn">e</span>  which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
<span class="reftext">29</span>I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in My Father’s kingdom.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Zechariah 13:7–9; Mark 14:27–31; Luke 22:31–38; John 13:36–38)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span>“This very night you will all fall away on account of Me. For it is written:</span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘I will strike the Shepherd, </p><p class="indentred"> and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">32</span>But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Peter said to Him, “Even if all fall away on account of You, I never will.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">34</span>“Truly I tell you,”</span> Jesus declared, <span>“this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Peter replied, “Even if I have to die with You, I will never deny You.” And all the other disciples said the same thing.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Prays at Gethsemane<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 14:32–42; Luke 22:39–46)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>At that time Jesus went with His disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and He told them, <span>“Sit here while I go over there and pray.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
<span class="reftext">38</span>Then He said to them, <span>“My soul is consumed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Going a little farther, He fell facedown and prayed, <span>“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You will.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Then Jesus returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. <span>“Were you not able to keep watch with Me for one hour?”</span> He asked Peter.
<span><span class="reftext">41</span>“Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>A second time He went away and prayed, <span>“My Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it, may Your will be done.”</span>
<span class="reftext">43</span>And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping—for their eyes were heavy.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>So He left them and went away once more and prayed a third time, saying the same thing.
<span class="reftext">45</span>Then He returned to the disciples and said, <span>“Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
<span class="reftext">46</span>Rise, let us go! See, My betrayer is approaching!”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Betrayal of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 14:43–52; Luke 22:47–53; John 18:1–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him.”
<span class="reftext">49</span>Going directly to Jesus, he said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">50</span>“Friend,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“do what you came for.”</span><span class="fn">g</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested Him.
<span class="reftext">51</span>At this, one of Jesus’ companions drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">52</span>“Put your sword back in its place,”</span> Jesus said to him. <span>“For all who draw the sword will die by the sword.
<span class="reftext">53</span>Are you not aware that I can call on My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?
<span class="reftext">54</span>But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">55</span>At that time Jesus said to the crowd, <span>“Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an outlaw? Every day I sat teaching in the temple courts,<span class="fn">h</span>  and you did not arrest Me.
<span class="reftext">56</span>But this has all happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus before the Sanhedrin<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 14:53–65; Luke 22:66–71; John 18:19–24)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">57</span>Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and elders had gathered.
<span class="reftext">58</span>But Peter followed Him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. And he went in and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">59</span>Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin<span class="fn">i</span>  were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death.
<span class="reftext">60</span>But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. </p><p class="reg1"> Finally two came forward
<span class="reftext">61</span>and declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">62</span>So the high priest stood up and asked Him, “Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">63</span>But Jesus remained silent. </p><p class="reg1"> Then the high priest said to Him, “I charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">64</span>“You have said it yourself,”</span> Jesus answered. <span>“But I say to all of you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power<span class="fn">j</span>  and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</span><span class="fn">k</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">65</span>At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.
<span class="reftext">66</span>What do you think?” </p><p class="reg1">“He deserves to die,” they answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">67</span>Then they spit in His face and struck Him. Others slapped Him
<span class="reftext">68</span>and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit You?”
</p><p class="hdg">Peter Denies Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 14:66–72; Luke 22:54–62; John 18:15–18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">69</span>Meanwhile, Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him. “You also were with Jesus the Galilean,” she said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">70</span>But he denied it before them all: “I do not know what you are talking about.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">71</span>When Peter had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">72</span>And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">73</span>After a little while, those standing nearby came up to Peter. “Surely you are one of them,” they said, “for your accent gives you away.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">74</span>At that he began to curse and swear to them, “I do not know the man!” </p><p class="reg1"> And immediately a rooster crowed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">75</span>Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: <span>“Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”</span> And he went outside and wept bitterly.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Aramaic <i class="calibre6">Simon the Potter</i> or <i class="calibre6">Simon the Jar Maker</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> See Deuteronomy 15:11.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">On the first of the Unleavened</i>; see Exodus 12:14–20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">the Twelve</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">the new covenant</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Zechariah 13:7<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">50</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">“Friend,” Jesus replied, “for what have you come?”</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">55</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">59</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the whole Council</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">64</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the right hand of the Mighty One</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">64</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> See Psalm 110:1 and Daniel 7:13.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
