<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Paul’s Defense to the Crowd<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 9:1–19; Acts 26:1–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>“Brothers and fathers, listen now to my <span class='spell ca'>defence</span><span class='spell gb'>defence</span><span class='spell us'>defense</span> before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”
<span class="reftext">2</span>When they heard him speak to them in Hebrew,<span class="fn">a</span>  they became even more silent. </p><p class="reg1"> Then Paul declared,
<span class="reftext">3</span>“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but raised in this city. I was educated at the feet of Gamaliel in strict conformity to the law of our fathers. I am just as zealous for God as any of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> here today.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I persecuted this Way even to the death, detaining both men and women and throwing them into prison,
<span class="reftext">5</span>as the high priest and the whole Council can testify about me. I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to apprehend these people and bring them to Jerusalem to be punished.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>About noon as I was approaching Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.
<span class="reftext">7</span>I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, <span>‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>?’</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>‘Who are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>, Lord?’ I asked. </p><p class="reg1"><span>‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,’</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> replied.
<span class="reftext">9</span>My companions saw the light, but they could not understand the voice of the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> speaking to me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then I asked, ‘What should I do, Lord?’ </p><p class="reg1"><span>‘Get up and go into Damascus,’</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> told me. <span>‘There you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.’</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Because the brilliance of the light had blinded me, my companions led me by the hand into Damascus.
<span class="reftext">12</span>There a man named Ananias, a devout observer of the law who was highly regarded by all the Jews living there,
<span class="reftext">13</span>came and stood beside me. ‘Brother Saul,’ he said, ‘receive your sight.’ And at that moment I could see him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> will, and to see the <span class='cap'>Righteous</span><span class='nocap'>righteous</span> <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span>, and to hear <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> voice.
<span class="reftext">15</span>You will be <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> witness to everyone of what you have seen and heard.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized, and wash your sins away, calling on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> name.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Later, when I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance
<span class="reftext">18</span>and saw the Lord<span class="fn">b</span>  saying to me, <span>‘Hurry! Leave Jerusalem quickly, because the people here will not accept your testimony about <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.’</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>‘Lord,’ I answered, ‘they know very well that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And when the blood of <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> witness<span class="fn">c</span>  Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and watching over the garments of those who killed him.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said to me, <span>‘Go! I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’</span>”
</p><p class="hdg">Paul the Roman Citizen</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>The crowd listened to Paul until he made this statement. Then they lifted up their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He is not fit to live!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,
<span class="reftext">24</span>the commander ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks. He directed that Paul be flogged and interrogated to determine the reason for this outcry against him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>But as they stretched him out to strap him down, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it lawful for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to flog a Roman citizen without a trial?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>On hearing this, the centurion went and reported it to the commander. “What are you going to do?” he said. “This man is a Roman citizen.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” </p><p class="reg1">“Yes,” he answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>“I paid a high price for my citizenship,” said the commander. </p><p class="reg1">“But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Then those who were about to interrogate Paul stepped back, and the commander himself was alarmed when he <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that he had put a Roman citizen in chains.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>The next day the commander, wanting to learn the real reason Paul was accused by the Jews, released him and ordered the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin<span class="fn">d</span>  to assemble. Then he brought Paul down and had him stand before them.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in Aramaic</i>; literally <i class="calibre6">in the Hebrew language</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">saw Him</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">martyr</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the whole Council</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
