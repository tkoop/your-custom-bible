<font ><b>Paul’s Defense to the Crowd</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Brothers and fathers, listen now to my
defense before you.” When they heard him speak to them in Hebrew,
they became even more silent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Paul declared, “I am a Jew, born in
Tarsus of Cilicia, but raised in this city. I was educated at the
feet of Gamaliel in strict conformity to the law of our fathers. I am
just as zealous for God as any of you here today. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I persecuted this Way even to the death,
detaining both men and women and throwing them into prison, as the
high priest and the whole Council can testify about me. I even
obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and I was
on my way to apprehend these people and bring them to Jerusalem to be
punished. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >About noon as I was approaching Damascus,
suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me. I fell to the
ground and heard a voice say to me, <font color="#a80000">‘Saul,
Saul, why do you persecute Me?’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
‘<font >Who are You, Lord?’ I asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >I am Jesus of
Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,’</font> He replied. My
companions saw the light, but they could not understand the voice of
the One speaking to me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I asked, ‘What should I do, Lord?’
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Get up and go
into Damascus,’</font> He told me. <font color="#a80000">‘There
you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because the brilliance of the light had
blinded me, my companions led me by the hand into Damascus. There a
man named Ananias, a devout observer of the law who was highly
regarded by all the Jews living there, came and stood beside me.
‘Brother Saul,’ he said, ‘receive your sight.’ And at that
moment I could see him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he said, ‘The God of our fathers
has appointed you to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and
to hear His voice. You will be His witness to everyone of what you
have seen and heard. And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be
baptized, and wash your sins away, calling on His name.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Later, when I had returned to Jerusalem
and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance and saw the Lord
saying to me, <font color="#a80000">‘Hurry! Leave Jerusalem
quickly, because the people here will not accept your testimony about
Me.’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
‘<font >Lord,’ I answered, ‘they know very
well that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those
who believed in You. And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was
shed, I stood there giving my approval and watching over the garments
of those who killed him.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He said to me, <font color="#a80000">‘Go!
I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’</font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The crowd listened to Paul until he made
this statement. Then they lifted up their voices and shouted, “Rid
the earth of him! He is not fit to live!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As they were shouting and throwing off
their cloaks and tossing dust into the air, the commander ordered
that Paul be brought into the barracks. He directed that Paul be
flogged and interrogated to determine the reason for this outcry
against him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But as they stretched him out to strap him
down, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it lawful for
you to flog a Roman citizen without a trial?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On hearing this, the centurion went and
reported it to the commander. “What are you going to do?” he
said. “This man is a Roman citizen.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The commander went to Paul and asked,
“Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Yes,” he answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I paid a high price for my
citizenship,” said the commander. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >But I was born a citizen,” Paul
replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then those who were about to interrogate
Paul stepped back, and the commander himself was alarmed when he
realized that he had put a Roman citizen in chains. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day the commander, wanting to
learn the real reason Paul was accused by the Jews, released him and
ordered the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin to assemble. Then
he brought Paul down and had him stand before them. </font>
