<span class="reftext">2</span>Indeed, the Israelites have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, so that the holy seed has been mixed with the people of the land. And the leaders and officials have taken the lead in this unfaithfulness!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>When I heard this report, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled out some hair from my head and beard, and sat down in horror.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles, while I sat there in horror until the evening offering.
</p><p class="hdg">Ezra’s Prayer of Confession</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>At the evening offering, I got up from my humiliation with my tunic and cloak torn, and I fell on my knees, spread out my hands to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> my God,
<span class="reftext">6</span>and said: </p><p class="tab1stline">“O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>, my God, because our iniquities are higher than our heads, and our guilt has reached the heavens.
<span class="reftext">7</span>From the days of our fathers to this day, our guilt has been great. Because of our iniquities, we and our kings and priests have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the earth and put to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation, as we are this day.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>But now, for a brief moment, grace has come from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God to preserve for us a remnant and to give us a stake<span class="fn">a</span>  in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> holy place. Even in our bondage, our God has given us new life and light to our eyes.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Though we are slaves, our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has extended to us grace in the sight of the kings of Persia, giving us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and giving us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>And now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have forsaken the commandments
<span class="reftext">11</span>that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> gave through <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> servants the prophets, saying: ‘The land that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are entering to possess is a land polluted by the impurity of its peoples and the abominations with which they have filled it from end to end.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Now, therefore, do not give <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sons. Never seek their peace or prosperity, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may be strong and may eat the good things of the land, leaving it as an inheritance to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sons forever.’
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>After all that has come upon us because of our evil deeds and our great guilt (though <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have given us such a remnant as this),
<span class="reftext">14</span>shall we again break <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> commandments and intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations? Would <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span>an class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> not become so angry with us as to wipe us out, leaving no remnant or survivor?
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, God of Israel, <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> are righteous! For we remain this day as a remnant. Here we are before <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> in our guilt, though because of it no one can stand before <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">nail</i> or <i class="calibre6">foothold</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
