<font face="Tahoma, serif">After these things had been accomplished,
the leaders approached me and said, “The people of Israel,
including the priests and Levites, have not kept themselves separate
from the surrounding peoples whose abominations are like those of the
Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites,
Egyptians, and Amorites. Indeed, the Israelites have taken some of
their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, so that the
holy seed has been mixed with the people of the land. And the leaders
and officials have taken the lead in this unfaithfulness!” </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">O my God, I am ashamed and embarrassed
to lift up my face to You, my God, because our iniquities are higher
than our heads, and our guilt has reached the heavens. From the days
of our fathers to this day, our guilt has been great. Because of our
iniquities, we and our kings and priests have been delivered into the
hands of the kings of the earth and put to the sword and captivity,
to pillage and humiliation, as we are this day. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">But now, for a brief moment, grace has
come from the LORD our God to preserve for us a remnant and to give
us a stake in His holy place. Even in our bondage, our God has given
us new life and light to our eyes. Though we are slaves, our God has
not forsaken us in our bondage, but He has extended to us grace in
the sight of the kings of Persia, giving us new life to rebuild the
house of our God and repair its ruins, and giving us a wall of
protection in Judah and Jerusalem. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And now, our God, what can we say after
this? For we have forsaken the commandments that You gave through
Your servants the prophets, saying: ‘The land that you are entering
to possess is a land polluted by the impurity of its peoples and the
abominations with which they have filled it from end to end. Now,
therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or
take their daughters for your sons. Never seek their peace or
prosperity, so that you may be strong and may eat the good things of
the land, leaving it as an inheritance to your sons forever.’ </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">After all that has come upon us because of
our evil deeds and our great guilt (though You, our God, have
punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have given us such a
remnant as this), shall we again break Your commandments and
intermarry with the peoples who commit these abominations? Would You
not become so angry with us as to wipe us out, leaving no remnant or
survivor? </font>
