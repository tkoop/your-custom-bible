<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Job Laments the Finality of Death</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>“Man, who is born of woman, </p><p class="indent"> is short of days and full of trouble.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Like a flower, he comes forth, then withers away; </p><p class="indent"> like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Do You open Your eyes to one like this? </p><p class="indent"> Will You bring him into <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> before You?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Who can bring out clean from unclean? </p><p class="indent"> No one!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Since his days are determined </p><p class="indent"> and the number of his months is with You, </p><p class="indent1"> and since You have set limits </p><p class="indent"> that he cannot exceed,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>look away from him and let him rest, </p><p class="indent"> so he can enjoy his day as a hired hand.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>For there is hope for a tree: </p><p class="indent"> If it is cut down, it will sprout again, </p><p class="indent"> and its tender shoots will not fail.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>If its roots grow old in the ground </p><p class="indent"> and its stump dies in the soil,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>at the scent of water it will bud </p><p class="indent"> and put forth twigs like a sapling.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>But a man dies and is laid low; </p><p class="indent"> he breathes his last, and where is he?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>As water disappears from the sea </p><p class="indent"> and a river becomes parched and dry,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>so a man lies down </p><p class="indent"> and does not rise. </p><p class="indent1"> Until the heavens are no more, </p><p class="indent"> he will not be awakened or roused from sleep.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>If only You would hide me in Sheol </p><p class="indent"> and conceal me until Your anger has passed! </p><p class="indent1"> If only You would appoint a time for me </p><p class="indent"> and then remember me!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When a man dies, will he live again? </p><p class="indent"> All the days of my hard service I will wait, </p><p class="indent"> until my renewal<span class="fn">a</span>  comes.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>You will call, and I will answer; </p><p class="indent"> You will desire the work of Your hands.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>For then You would count my steps, </p><p class="indent"> but would not keep track of my sin.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>My transgression would be sealed in a bag, </p><p class="indent"> and You would cover over my iniquity.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>But as a mountain erodes and crumbles </p><p class="indent"> and a rock is dislodged from its place,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>as water wears away the stones </p><p class="indent"> and torrents wash away the soil, </p><p class="indent"> so You destroy a man’s hope.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>You forever overpower him, and he passes on; </p><p class="indent"> You change his countenance and send him away.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>If his sons receive <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span>, he does not know it; </p><p class="indent"> if they are brought low, he is unaware.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>He feels only the pain of his own body </p><p class="indent"> and mourns only for himself.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">my change</i> or <i class="calibre6">my relief</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
