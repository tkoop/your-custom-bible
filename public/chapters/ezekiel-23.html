<font ><b>The Two Adulterous Sisters</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Again the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same
mother, and they played in Egypt, prostituting themselves from their
youth. Their breasts were fondled there, and their virgin bosoms
caressed. The older was named Oholah, and her sister was named
Oholibah. They became Mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. As
for their identities, Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Oholah prostituted herself while she was
still Mine. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors
clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all desirable young men,
horsemen mounted on steeds. She offered sexual favors to all the
elite of Assyria. She defiled herself with all the idols of those for
whom she lusted. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >She did not give up the prostitution she
began in Egypt, when men slept with her in her youth, caressed her
virgin bosom, and poured out their lust upon her. Therefore I
delivered her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians for whom
she lusted. They exposed her nakedness, seized her sons and
daughters, and put her to the sword. Thus she became a byword among
women, and they executed judgment against her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her
lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister. She too
lusted after the Assyrians—governors and commanders, warriors
dressed in splendor, horsemen riding on steeds, all desirable young
men. And I saw that she too had defiled herself; both of them had
taken the same path. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But Oholibah carried her prostitution even
further. She saw the men portrayed on the wall, images of the
Chaldeans, engraved in vermilion, wearing belts on their waists and
flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like officers of
the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their birth. At the sight of
them, she lusted for them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.
Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their
lust they defiled her. But after she had been defiled by them, she
turned away in disgust. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Oholibah openly prostituted herself
and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as
I had turned away from her sister. Yet she multiplied her
promiscuity, remembering the days of her youth, when she had
prostituted herself in the land of Egypt and lusted after their
lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission
was like that of stallions. So you revisited the indecency of your
youth, when the Egyptians caressed your bosom and pressed your young
breasts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Lord
GOD says: ‘I will incite your lovers against you, those from whom
you turned away in disgust. And I will bring them against you from
every side— the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of
Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them—all desirable
young men, governors and commanders, officers and men of renown,
mounted on horses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >They will come against you with a host of
peoples, with weapons, chariots, and wagons. They will array
themselves against you on every side with buckler and shield and
helmet. I will delegate judgment to them, and they will punish you
according to their own standards. And I will set My jealous rage
against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off
your noses and ears, and your survivors will fall by the sword. They
will seize your sons and daughters, and your remnant will be consumed
by fire. They will strip off your clothes and take your fine jewelry.
So I will put an end to your indecency and prostitution, which began
in the land of Egypt, and you will not lift your eyes to them or
remember Egypt anymore.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >For this is what the Lord GOD says:
‘Surely I will deliver you into the hands of those you hate, from
whom you turned away in disgust. They will treat you with hatred,
take all for which you have worked, and leave you naked and bare, so
that the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your indecency
and promiscuity have brought these things upon you, because you have
prostituted yourself with the nations and defiled yourself with their
idols. Because you have followed the path of your sister, I will put
her cup into your hand.’ </font>

them their abominations. For they have committed adultery, and blood

They have even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to Me, in
the fire as food for their idols. </font>

the very day they slaughtered their children for their idols, they
entered My sanctuary to profane it. Yes, they did this inside My
house. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Furthermore, you sisters sent messengers
for men who came from afar; and behold, when they arrived, you bathed
for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry. You
sat on a couch of luxury with a table spread before it, on which you
had set My incense and My oil, accompanied by the sound of a carefree
crowd. Drunkards were brought in from the desert along with men from
the rabble, who put bracelets on your wrists and beautiful crowns on
your head. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

to indecency in the land, and all the women will be admonished not to
imitate your behavior. They will repay you for your indecency, and
you will bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then you
