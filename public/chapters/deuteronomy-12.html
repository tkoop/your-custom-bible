And there <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are to bring everything I command you: <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> burnt offerings and sacrifices, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> tithes and special gifts, and all the choice offerings <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> vow to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> shall rejoice before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God—<span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sons and daughters, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> menservants and maidservants, and the Levite within <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> gates, since he has no portion or inheritance among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see;
<span class="reftext">14</span>you must offer them only in the place <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will choose in one of your tribal territories, and there you shall do all that I command you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>But whenever you want, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your gates, according to the blessing <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has given you.

<span class="reftext">16</span>but <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Within your gates you must not eat the tithe of your grain or new wine or oil, the firstborn of your herds or flocks, any of the offerings that you have vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Instead, you must eat them in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God at the place <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will choose—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite within your gates. Rejoice before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God in all you do,
<span class="reftext">19</span>and be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> live in your land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>When <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God expands your territory as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has promised, and you crave meat and say, “I want to eat meat,” you may eat it whenever you want.
<span class="reftext">21</span>If the place where <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God chooses to put <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> <span class='cap'>Name</span><span class='nocap'>name</span> is too far from you, then you may slaughter any of the herd or flock <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has given you, as I have commanded you, and you may eat it within your gates whenever you want.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Indeed, you may eat it as you would eat a gazelle or deer; both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Only be sure not to eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat.
<span class="reftext">24</span>You must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>But you are to take your holy things and your vow offerings and go to the place <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will choose.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Present the meat and blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God. The blood of your other sacrifices must be poured out beside the altar of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, but you may eat the meat.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Be careful to obey all these things I command you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.
