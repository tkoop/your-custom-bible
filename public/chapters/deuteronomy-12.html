<font ><b>One Place for Worship</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These are the statutes and ordinances you
must be careful to follow all the days you live in the land that the
LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Destroy completely all the places where
the nations you are dispossessing have served their gods—atop the
high mountains, on the hills, and under every green tree. Tear down
their altars, smash their sacred pillars, burn up their Asherah
poles, cut down the idols of their gods, and wipe out their names
from every place. You shall not worship the LORD your God in this
way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Instead, you must seek the place the LORD
your God will choose from among all your tribes to establish as a
dwelling for His Name, and there you must go. To that place you are
to bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and heave
offerings, your vow offerings and freewill offerings, as well as the
firstborn of your herds and flocks. There, in the presence of the
LORD your God, you and your households shall eat and rejoice in all
you do, because the LORD your God has blessed you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are not to do as we are doing here
today, where everyone does what seems right in his own eyes. For you
have not yet come to the resting place and the inheritance that the
LORD your God is giving you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When you cross the Jordan and live in the
land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and He
gives you rest from all the enemies around you and you dwell
securely, then the LORD your God will choose a dwelling for His Name.
And there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt
offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the
choice offerings you vow to the LORD. And you shall rejoice before
the LORD your God—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants
and maidservants, and the Levite within your gates, since he has no
portion or inheritance among you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Be careful not to offer your burnt
offerings in just any place you see; you must offer them only in the
place the LORD will choose in one of your tribal territories, and
there you shall do all that I command you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But whenever you want, you may slaughter
and eat meat within any of your gates, according to the blessing the
LORD your God has given you. Both the ceremonially clean and unclean
may eat it as they would a gazelle or deer, but you must not eat the
blood; pour it on the ground like water. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Within your gates you must not eat the
tithe of your grain or new wine or oil, the firstborn of your herds
or flocks, any of the offerings that you have vowed to give, or your
freewill offerings or special gifts. Instead, you must eat them in
the presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God will
choose—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and
maidservants, and the Levite within your gates. Rejoice before the
LORD your God in all you do, and be careful not to neglect the
Levites as long as you live in your land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the LORD your God expands your
territory as He has promised, and you crave meat and say, “I want
to eat meat,” you may eat it whenever you want. If the place where
the LORD your God chooses to put His Name is too far from you, then
you may slaughter any of the herd or flock He has given you, as I
have commanded you, and you may eat it within your gates whenever you
want. Indeed, you may eat it as you would eat a gazelle or deer; both
the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it. Only be sure not
to eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat
the life with the meat. You must not eat the blood; pour it on the
ground like water. Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and
your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in
the eyes of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But you are to take your holy things and
your vow offerings and go to the place the LORD will choose. Present
the meat and blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD
your God. The blood of your other sacrifices must be poured out
beside the altar of the LORD your God, but you may eat the meat. Be
careful to obey all these things I command you, so that it may always
go well with you and your children after you, because you will be
doing what is good and right in the eyes of the LORD your God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the LORD your God cuts off before you
the nations you are entering to dispossess, and you drive them out
and live in their land, be careful not to be ensnared by their ways
after they have been destroyed before you. Do not inquire about their
gods, asking, “How do these nations serve their gods? I will do
likewise.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You must not worship the LORD your God in
this way, because they practice for their gods every abomination
which the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the
fire as sacrifices to their gods. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >See that you do everything I command you;
do not add to it or subtract from it. </font>
