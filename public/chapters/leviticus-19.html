<font >When you sacrifice a peace offering to the
LORD, you shall offer it for your acceptance. It shall be eaten on
the day you sacrifice it, or on the next day; but what remains on the
third day must be burned up. If any of it is eaten on the third day,
it is tainted and will not be accepted. Whoever eats it will bear his
iniquity, for he has profaned what is holy to the LORD. That person
must be cut off from his people. </font>

<font >If a man lies carnally with a slave girl
promised to another man but who has not been redeemed or given her
freedom, there must be due punishment. But they are not to be put to
death, because she had not been freed. The man, however, must bring a
ram to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting as his guilt offering to
the LORD. The priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the
LORD with the ram of the guilt offering for the sin he has committed,
and he will be forgiven the sin he has committed. </font>
