<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Commandments for Holiness</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the LORD said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Speak to the whole congregation of Israel and tell them: Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Each of you must respect his mother and father, and you must keep My Sabbaths. I am the LORD your God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods. I am the LORD your God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When you sacrifice a peace offering to the LORD, you shall offer it for your acceptance.
<span class="reftext">6</span>It shall be eaten on the day you sacrifice it, or on the next day; but what remains on the third day must be burned up.
<span class="reftext">7</span>If any of it is eaten on the third day, it is tainted and will not be accepted.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Whoever eats it will bear his iniquity, for he has profaned what is holy to the LORD. That person must be cut off from his people.
</p><p class="hdg">Love Your Neighbor<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Romans 13:8–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>When you reap the harvest of your land, you are not to reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest.
<span class="reftext">10</span>You must not strip your vineyard bare or gather its fallen grapes. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner. I am the LORD your God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>You must not steal. You must not lie or deceive one another.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>You must not swear falsely by My name and so profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>You must not defraud your neighbour or rob him. </p><p class="reg1"> You must not withhold until morning the wages due a hired hand.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>You must not curse the deaf or place a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God. I am the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>You must not pervert justice; you must not show partiality to the poor or favouritism to the rich; you are to judge your neighbour fairly.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>You must not go about spreading slander among your people. </p><p class="reg1"> You must not endanger the life<span class="fn">b</span>  of your neighbour. I am the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>You must not harbour hatred against your brother in your heart. Directly rebuke your neighbour, so that you will not incur guilt on account of him.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against any of your people, but love your neighbour as yourself.<span class="fn">c</span>  I am the LORD.
</p><p class="hdg">Keep My Statutes</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>You are to keep My statutes. You shall not crossbreed two different kinds of livestock; you shall not sow your fields with two kinds of seed; and you shall not wear clothing made of two kinds of material.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>If a man lies carnally with a slave girl promised to another man but who has not been redeemed or given her freedom, there must be due punishment. But they are not to be put to death, because she had not been freed.
<span class="reftext">21</span>The man, however, must bring a ram to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting as his guilt offering to the LORD.
<span class="reftext">22</span>The priest shall make atonement on his behalf before the LORD with the ram of the guilt offering for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven the sin he has committed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When you enter the land and plant any kind of tree for food, you shall regard the fruit as forbidden.<span class="fn">d</span>  For three years it will be forbidden to you and must not be eaten.
<span class="reftext">24</span>In the fourth year all its fruit must be consecrated as a praise offering to the LORD.
<span class="reftext">25</span>But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit; thus your harvest will be increased. I am the LORD your God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>You must not eat anything with blood still in it. </p><p class="reg1"> You must not practice divination or sorcery.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>You must not cut off the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>You must not make any cuts in your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>You must not defile your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the land will be prostituted and filled with depravity.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>You must keep My Sabbaths and have reverence for My sanctuary. I am the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>You must not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out, or you will be defiled by them. I am the LORD your God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>You are to rise in the presence of the elderly, honour the aged, and fear your God. I am the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>When a foreigner resides with you in your land, you must not oppress him.
<span class="reftext">34</span>You must treat the foreigner living among you as native-born and love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>You must not use dishonest measures of length, weight, or volume.
<span class="reftext">36</span>You shall maintain honest scales and weights, an honest ephah,<span class="fn">e</span>  and an honest hin.<span class="fn">f</span>  I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>You must keep all My statutes and all My ordinances and follow them. I am the LORD.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in 1 Peter 1:16<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">blood</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Cited in Matthew 5:43, Matthew 19:19, Matthew 22:39, Mark 12:31, Luke 10:27, Romans 13:9, Galatians 5:14, and James 2:8<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">as uncircumcised</i>; twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">An ephah</i> is a dry measure of approximately 20 dry quarts or 22 liters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">A hin</i> is a liquid measure of approximately 0.97 gallons or 3.67 liters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
