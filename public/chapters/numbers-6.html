<font ><b>The Nazirite Vow</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
the Israelites and tell them that if a man or woman makes a special
vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to the LORD, he is to
abstain from wine and strong drink. He must not drink vinegar made
from wine or strong drink, and he must not drink any grape juice or
eat fresh grapes or raisins. All the days of his separation, he is
not to eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds
or skins. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the entire period of his vow of
separation, no razor shall pass over his head. He must be holy until
the time of his separation to the LORD is complete; he must let the
hair of his head grow long. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Throughout the days of his separation to
the LORD, he must not go near a dead body. Even if his father or
mother or brother or sister should die, he is not to defile himself,
because the crown of consecration to his God is upon his head.
Throughout the time of his separation, he is holy to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If someone suddenly dies in his presence
and defiles his consecrated head of hair, he must shave his head on
the day of his cleansing—the seventh day. On the eighth day he must
bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting. And the priest is to offer one as a
sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for
him, because he has sinned by being in the presence of the dead body.
On that day he must consecrate his head again. He must rededicate his
time of separation to the LORD and bring a year-old male lamb as a
guilt offering. But the preceding days shall not be counted, because
his separation was defiled. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now this is the law of the Nazirite when
his time of separation is complete: He must be brought to the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and he is to present an offering to
the LORD of an unblemished year-old male lamb as a burnt offering, an
unblemished year-old female lamb as a sin offering, and an
unblemished ram as a peace offering— together with their grain
offerings and drink offerings—and a basket of unleavened cakes made
from fine flour mixed with oil and unleavened wafers coated with oil.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The priest is to present all these before
the LORD and make the sin offering and the burnt offering. He shall
also offer the ram as a peace offering to the LORD, along with the
basket of unleavened bread. And the priest is to offer the
accompanying grain offering and drink offering. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting, the Nazirite is to shave his consecrated head, take the
hair, and put it on the fire under the peace offering. And the priest
is to take the boiled shoulder from the ram, one unleavened cake from
the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and put them into the hands of
the Nazirite who has just shaved the hair of his consecration. The
priest shall then wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. This
is a holy portion for the priest, in addition to the breast of the
wave offering and the thigh that was presented. After that, the
Nazirite may drink wine. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the law of the Nazirite who vows
his offering to the LORD for his separation, in addition to whatever
else he can afford; he must fulfill whatever vow he makes, according
to the law of his separation.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron
and his sons: This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to
them: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >May the LORD bless you </font>

<font >and keep you; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >may the LORD cause His face to shine upon
you </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and be gracious to you; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >may the LORD lift up His countenance
toward you </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and give you peace.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they shall put My name on the
Israelites, and I will bless them.” </font>
