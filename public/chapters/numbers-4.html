<font ><b>The Duties of the Kohathites,
Gershonites, and Merarites</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
“Take a census of the Kohathites among the Levites by their clans
and families, men from thirty to fifty years old—everyone who is
qualified to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This service of the Kohathites at the Tent
of Meeting regards the most holy things. Whenever the camp sets out,
Aaron and his sons are to go in, take down the veil of the curtain,
and cover the ark of the Testimony with it. They are to place over
this a covering of fine leather, spread a solid blue cloth over it,
and insert its poles. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Over the table of the Presence they are to
spread a blue cloth and place the plates and cups on it, along with
the bowls and pitchers for the drink offering. The regular bread
offering is to remain on it. And they shall spread a scarlet cloth
over them, cover them with fine leather, and insert the poles. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They are to take a blue cloth and cover
the lampstand used for light, together with its lamps, wick trimmers,
and trays, as well as the jars of oil with which to supply it. Then
they shall wrap it and all its utensils inside a covering of fine
leather and put it on the carrying frame. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Over the gold altar they are to spread a
blue cloth, cover it with fine leather, and insert the poles. They
are to take all the utensils for serving in the sanctuary, place them
in a blue cloth, cover them with fine leather, and put them on the
carrying frame. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they shall remove the ashes from the
bronze altar, spread a purple cloth over it, and place on it all the
vessels used to serve there: the firepans, meat forks, shovels, and
sprinkling bowls—all the equipment of the altar. They are to spread
over it a covering of fine leather and insert the poles. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Aaron and his sons have finished
covering the holy objects and all their equipment, as soon as the
camp is ready to move, the Kohathites shall come and do the carrying.
But they must not touch the holy objects, or they will die. These are
the transportation duties of the Kohathites regarding the Tent of
Meeting. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Eleazar son of Aaron the priest shall
oversee the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the daily grain
offering, and the anointing oil. He has oversight of the entire
tabernacle and everything in it, including the holy objects and their
utensils.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Do
not allow the Kohathite tribal clans to be cut off from among the
Levites. In order that they may live and not die when they come near
the most holy things, do this for them: Aaron and his sons are to go
in and assign each man his task and what he is to carry. But the
Kohathites are not to go in and look at the holy objects, even for a
moment, or they will die.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “Take a
census of the Gershonites as well, by their families and clans, from
thirty to fifty years old, counting everyone who comes to serve in
the work at the Tent of Meeting. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the service of the Gershonite
clans regarding work and transport: They are to carry the curtains of
the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting with the covering of fine leather
over it, the curtains for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the
curtains of the courtyard, and the curtains for the entrance at the
gate of the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and altar, along
with their ropes and all the equipment for their service. The
Gershonites will do all that needs to be done with these items. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All the service of the Gershonites—all
their transport duties and other work—is to be done at the
direction of Aaron and his sons; you are to assign to them all that
they are responsible to carry. This is the service of the Gershonite
clans at the Tent of Meeting, and their duties shall be under the
direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the sons of Merari, you are to
number them by their clans and families, from thirty to fifty years
old, counting everyone who comes to serve in the work of the Tent of
Meeting. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the duty for all their service at
the Tent of Meeting: to carry the frames of the tabernacle with its
crossbars, posts, and bases, and the posts of the surrounding
courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes, including all their
equipment and everything related to their use. You shall assign by
name the items that they are responsible to carry. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the service of the Merarite clans
according to all their work at the Tent of Meeting, under the
direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the
congregation numbered the Kohathites by their clans and families,
everyone from thirty to fifty years old who came to serve in the work
at the Tent of Meeting. And those numbered by their clans totaled
2,750. These were counted from the Kohathite clans, everyone who
could serve at the Tent of Meeting. Moses and Aaron numbered them
according to the command of the LORD through Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Gershonites were numbered by
their clans and families, everyone from thirty to fifty years old who
came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting. And those numbered
by their clans and families totaled 2,630. These were counted from
the Gershonite clans who served at the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses
and Aaron counted at the LORD’s command. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the Merarites were numbered by their
clans and families, everyone from thirty to fifty years old who came
to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting. The men registered by
their clans numbered 3,200. These were counted from the Merarite
clans, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the LORD’s command through
Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel
numbered by their clans and families all the Levites from thirty to
fifty years old who came to do the work of serving and carrying the
Tent of Meeting. And the number of men was 8,580. At the LORD’s
command they were numbered through Moses and each one was assigned
his work and burden, as the LORD had commanded Moses. </font>
