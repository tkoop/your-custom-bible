<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Greetings from Paul and Timothy<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Philippians 1:1–2; Colossians 1:1–2)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, </p><p class="reg1"> To Philemon our beloved fellow worker,
<span class="reftext">2</span>to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets at your<span class="fn">a</span>  house:
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Grace and peace to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from God our <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</p><p class="hdg">Philemon’s Faith and Love</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I always thank my God, remembering you in my prayers,
<span class="reftext">5</span>because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.
<span class="reftext">6</span>I pray that your partnership in the faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every good thing that is ours in Christ.
<span class="reftext">7</span>I take great joy and encouragement in your love, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Appeal for Onesimus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So although in Christ I am bold enough to order you to do what is proper,
<span class="reftext">9</span>I prefer to appeal on the basis of love. For I, Paul, am now aged, and a prisoner of Christ Jesus as well.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>I appeal to you for my child Onesimus,<span class="fn">b</span>  whose father I became while I was in chains.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.
<span class="reftext">12</span>I am sending back to you him who is my very heart.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I would have liked to keep him with me, so that on your behalf he could minister to me in my chains for the gospel.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your goodness will not be out of compulsion, but by your own free will.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back for good—
<span class="reftext">16</span>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a beloved brother. He is especially beloved to me, but even more so to you, both in person and in the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So if you consider me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.
<span class="reftext">18</span>But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account.
<span class="reftext">19</span>I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it—not to mention that you owe me your very self.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Yes, brother, let me have some benefit<span class="fn">c</span>  from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>In the meantime, prepare a guest room for me, because I hope that through <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> prayers I will be restored to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
</p><p class="hdg">Additional Greetings</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings,
<span class="reftext">24</span>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> spirit.<span class="fn">d</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">You</i> and <i class="calibre6">Your</i> are singular throughout this letter, except in verses 3, 22, and 25.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Onesimus</i> means <i class="calibre6">useful</i> (see verse 11) or <i class="calibre6">beneficial</i> (see verse 20).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">onaimēn</i>, a play on the name <i class="calibre6">Onesimus</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">Amen.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
