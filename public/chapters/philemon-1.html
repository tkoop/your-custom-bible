<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >To Philemon our beloved fellow worker, to
Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church
that meets at your house: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Grace and peace to you from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >I always thank my God, remembering you in
my prayers, because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and
your love for all the saints. I pray that your partnership in the
faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every good thing
that is ours in Christ. I take great joy and encouragement in your
love, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So although in Christ I am bold enough to
order you to do what is proper, I prefer to appeal on the basis of
love. For I, Paul, am now aged, and a prisoner of Christ Jesus as
well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >I appeal to you for my child Onesimus,
whose father I became while I was in chains. Formerly he was useless
to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me. I am
sending back to you him who is my very heart. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >I would have liked to keep him with me, so
that on your behalf he could minister to me in my chains for the
gospel. But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so
that your goodness will not be out of compulsion, but by your own
free will. For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a
while, so that you might have him back for good— no longer as a
slave, but better than a slave, as a beloved brother. He is
especially beloved to me, but even more so to you, both in person and
in the Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So if you consider me a partner, receive
him as you would receive me. But if he has wronged you in any way or
owes you anything, charge it to my account. I, Paul, write this with
my own hand. I will repay it—not to mention that you owe me your
very self. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Yes, brother, let me have some benefit
from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Confident of your obedience, I write to
you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >In the meantime, prepare a guest room for
me, because I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to
you. </font>
