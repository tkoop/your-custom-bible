<span class="reftext">7</span>Stay far away from a false accusation. Do not kill the innocent or the just, for I will not acquit the guilty.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But if you will listen carefully to his voice and do everything I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and a foe to your foes.
<span class="reftext">23</span>For My angel will go before you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will annihilate them.

<span class="reftext">28</span>I will send the hornet before you to drive the Hivites and Canaanites and Hittites out of your way.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>I will not drive them out before you in a single year; otherwise the land would become desolate and wild animals would multiply against you.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Little by little I will drive them out ahead of you, until you become fruitful and possess the land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>And I will establish your borders from the Red Sea<span class="fn">f</span>  to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the Euphrates.<span class="fn">g</span>  For I will deliver the inhabitants into your hand, and you will drive them out before you.
<span class="reftext">32</span>You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods.
