<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Elijah Flees from Jezebel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now Ahab told Jezebel everything that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “May the gods deal with me, and ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like the lives of those you killed!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,
<span class="reftext">4</span>while he himself <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> on a day’s journey into the wilderness. He sat down under a broom tree and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>,” he said. “Take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep. </p><p class="reg1"> Suddenly an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>And he looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. So he ate and drank and lay down again.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>A second time the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> returned and touched him, saying, “Get up and eat, or the journey will be too much for you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So he got up and ate and drank. And strengthened by that food, he walked forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb,<span class="fn">a</span>  the mountain of God.
</p><p class="hdg"><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> Speaks to Elijah at Horeb</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>There Elijah entered a cave and spent the night. And the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to him, saying, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>“I have been very zealous for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Hosts,” he replied, “but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, “Go out and stand on the mountain before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. Behold, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is about to pass by.” </p><p class="reg1"> And a great and mighty wind tore into the mountains and shattered the rocks before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, but <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was not in the wind. </p><p class="reg1"> After the wind there was an earthquake, but <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was not in the earthquake.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>After the earthquake there was a fire, but <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was not in the fire. </p><p class="reg1"> And after the fire came a still, small voice.
<span class="reftext">13</span>When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Suddenly a voice came to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>“I have been very zealous for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Hosts,” he replied, “but the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to him, “Go back by the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you arrive, you are to anoint Hazael as king over Aram.
<span class="reftext">16</span>You are also to anoint Jehu son<span class="fn">c</span>  of Nimshi as king over Israel and Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel-meholah to succeed you as prophet.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then Jehu will put to death whoever escapes the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death whoever escapes the sword of Jehu.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Nevertheless, I have reserved seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed to Baal<span class="fn">d</span>  and whose mouths have not kissed him.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Call of Elisha</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So Elijah departed and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve teams of oxen, and he was with the twelfth team. Elijah passed by him and threw his cloak around him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So Elisha left the oxen, ran after Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, and then I will follow you.” </p><p class="reg1">“Go on back,” Elijah replied, “for what have I done to you?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>So Elisha turned back from him, took his pair of oxen, and slaughtered them. With the oxen’s equipment, he cooked the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow and serve Elijah.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, Mount Sinai, or possibly a mountain in the range containing Mount Sinai<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Cited in Romans 11:3; here and in verse 14<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">grandson</i>; see 2 Kings 9:14.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Cited in Romans 11:4<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
