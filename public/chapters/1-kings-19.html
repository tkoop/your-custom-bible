<font ><b>The Call of Elisha</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Ahab told Jezebel everything that
Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the
sword. So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “May the gods
deal with me, and ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not
make your life like the lives of those you killed!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Elijah was afraid and ran for his
life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,
while he himself traveled on a day’s journey into the wilderness.
He sat down under a broom tree and prayed that he might die. “I
have had enough, LORD,” he said. “Take my life, for I am no
better than my fathers.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he lay down under the broom tree and
fell asleep. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Suddenly an angel touched him and said,
“Get up and eat.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And he looked around, and there by his
head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. So
he ate and drank and lay down again. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A second time the angel of the LORD
returned and touched him, saying, “Get up and eat, or the journey
will be too much for you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he got up and ate and drank. And
strengthened by that food, he walked forty days and forty nights
until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There Elijah entered a cave and spent the
night. And the word of the LORD came to him, saying, “What are you
doing here, Elijah?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I have been very zealous for the LORD,
the God of Hosts,” he replied, “but the Israelites have forsaken
Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with
the sword. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as
well.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said, “Go out and stand on
the mountain before the LORD. Behold, the LORD is about to pass by.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And a great and mighty wind tore into the
mountains and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was
not in the wind. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After the wind there was an earthquake,
but the LORD was not in the earthquake. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After the earthquake there was a fire, but
the LORD was not in the fire. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And after the fire came a still, small
voice. When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and
went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Suddenly a voice came to
him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I have been very zealous for the LORD,
the God of Hosts,” he replied, “but the Israelites have forsaken
Your covenant, torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with
the sword. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as
well.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to him, “Go back by
the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you arrive,
you are to anoint Hazael as king over Aram. You are also to anoint
Jehu son of Nimshi as king over Israel and Elisha son of Shaphat from
Abel-meholah to succeed you as prophet. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehu will put to death whoever
escapes the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death whoever
escapes the sword of Jehu. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, I have reserved seven
thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed to Baal and whose
mouths have not kissed him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Elijah departed and found Elisha son of
Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve teams of oxen, and he was with
the twelfth team. Elijah passed by him and threw his cloak around
him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Elisha left the oxen, ran after Elijah,
and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother goodbye, and
then I will follow you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Go on back,” Elijah replied, “for
what have I done to you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Elisha turned back from him, took his
pair of oxen, and slaughtered them. With the oxen’s equipment, he
cooked the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set
out to follow and serve Elijah. </font>
