<font ><b>The Serpent’s Deception</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the serpent was more crafty than any
beast of the field that the LORD God had made. And he said to the
woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in
the garden?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The woman answered the serpent, “We may
eat the fruit of the trees of the garden, but about the fruit of the
tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You must not eat
of it or touch it, or you will die.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >You will not surely die,” the serpent
told her. “For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes
will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the woman saw that the tree was good
for food and pleasing to the eyes, and that it was desirable for
obtaining wisdom, she took the fruit and ate it. She also gave some
to her husband who was with her, and he ate it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the eyes of both of them were opened,
and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed together fig leaves
and made coverings for themselves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the man and his wife heard the voice
of the LORD God walking in the garden in the breeze of the day, and
they hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees
of the garden. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the LORD God called out to the man,
“Where are you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I heard Your voice in the garden,” he
replied, “and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Who told you that you were naked?”
asked the LORD God. “Have you eaten from the tree of which I
commanded you not to eat?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the man answered, “The woman whom
You gave me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What
is this you have done?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >The serpent deceived me,” she
replied, “and I ate.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the LORD God said to the serpent: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Because you have done this, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >cursed are you above all livestock </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and every beast of the field! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >On your belly will you go, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >all the days of your life. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >And I will put enmity between you and the
woman, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and between your seed and her seed. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He will crush your head, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and you will strike his heel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >To the woman He said: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >I will sharply increase your pain in
childbirth; </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And to Adam He said: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Because you have listened to the voice
of your wife </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Adam named his wife Eve, because she
would be the mother of all the living. </font>

<font >Therefore the LORD God banished him from
the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
So He drove out the man and stationed cherubim on the east side of
the Garden of Eden, along with a whirling sword of flame to guard the
way to the tree of life. </font>
