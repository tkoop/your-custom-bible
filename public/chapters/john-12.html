<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Mary Anoints Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:6–13; Mark 14:3–9; Luke 7:36–50)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, the hometown of Lazarus, whom <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had raised from the dead.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So they hosted a dinner for Jesus there. Martha served, and Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then Mary took about a pint<span class="fn">a</span>  of expensive perfume, made of pure nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet and wiped them with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But one of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, asked,
<span class="reftext">5</span>“Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii<span class="fn">b</span>  and the money given to the poor?”
<span class="reftext">6</span>Judas did not say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money bag, he used to take from what was put into it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">7</span>“Leave her alone,”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“She has kept this perfume in preparation for the day of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> burial.
<span class="reftext">8</span>The poor you will always have with you,<span class="fn">c</span>  but you will not always have <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Plot to Kill Lazarus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews learned that Jesus was there. And they came not only because of <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, but also to see Lazarus, whom <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had raised from the dead.
<span class="reftext">10</span>So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,
<span class="reftext">11</span>for on account of him many of the Jews were deserting them and believing in Jesus.
</p><p class="hdg">The Triumphal Entry<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Zechariah 9:9–13; Matthew 21:1–11; Mark 11:1–11; Luke 19:28–40)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>The next day the great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">13</span>They took palm branches and went out to meet <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, shouting: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Hosanna!”<span class="fn">d</span>  </p><p class="indent1stline">“Blessed is <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> who comes in the name of the Lord!”<span class="fn">e</span>  </p><p class="indent1stline">“Blessed is the King of Israel!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Finding a young donkey, Jesus sat on it, as it is written:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>“Do not be afraid, O <span class='cap'>Daughter</span><span class='nocap'>daughter</span> of Zion. </p><p class="indent"> See, your King is coming, </p><p class="indent"> seated on the colt of a donkey.”<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>At first <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples did not understand these things, but after Jesus was glorified they remembered what had been done to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, and they <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that these very things had also been written about <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Meanwhile, many people continued to testify that they had been with Jesus when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead.
<span class="reftext">18</span>That is also why the crowd went out to meet <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, because they heard that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had performed this sign.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You can see that this is doing you no good. Look how the whole world has gone after <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>!”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Predicts His Death</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast.
<span class="reftext">21</span>They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested of him, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”
<span class="reftext">22</span>Philip relayed this appeal to Andrew, and both of them went and told Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But Jesus replied, <span>“The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Truly, truly, I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a seed; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Whoever loves his life will lose it, but whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
<span class="reftext">26</span>If anyone serves <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, he must follow <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>; and where I am, <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> servant will be as well. If anyone serves <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> will <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> him.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">27</span>Now <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> from this hour’? No, it is for this purpose that I have come to this hour.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Father, glorify <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> name!” </p><p class="reg1"> Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>The crowd standing there heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>In response, Jesus said, <span>“This voice was not for <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> benefit, but yours.
<span class="reftext">31</span>Now <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> is upon this world; now the prince of this world will be cast out.
<span class="reftext">32</span>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span>.”</span>
<span class="reftext">33</span>He said this to indicate the kind of death <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was going to die.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>The crowd replied, “We have heard from the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> that the Christ will remain forever. So how can <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Then Jesus told them, <span>“For a little while longer, the <span class='cap'>Light</span><span class='nocap'>light</span> will be among you. Walk while you have the <span class='cap'>Light</span><span class='nocap'>light</span>, so that darkness will not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.
<span class="reftext">36</span>While you have the <span class='cap'>Light</span><span class='nocap'>light</span>, believe in the <span class='cap'>Light</span><span class='nocap'>light</span>, so that you may become sons of light.”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> After Jesus had spoken these things, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> went away and was hidden from them.
</p><p class="hdg">Belief and Unbelief</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>Although Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still did not believe in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">38</span>This was to <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> the word of Isaiah the prophet: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Lord, who has believed our message? </p><p class="indent"> And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>For this reason they were unable to believe. For again, Isaiah says:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">40</span>“He has blinded their eyes </p><p class="indent"> and hardened their hearts, </p><p class="indent1"> so that they cannot see with their eyes, </p><p class="indent"> and understand with their hearts, </p><p class="indent1"> and turn, </p><p class="indent"> and I would heal them.”<span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>Isaiah said these things because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">42</span>Nevertheless, many of the leaders believed in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue.
<span class="reftext">43</span>For they loved praise from men more than praise from God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>Then Jesus cried out, <span>“Whoever believes in <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> does not believe in <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> alone, but in the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who sent <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
<span class="reftext">45</span>And whoever sees <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> sees the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who sent <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
<span class="reftext">46</span>I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> should remain in darkness.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">47</span>As for anyone who hears <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> words and does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
<span class="reftext">48</span>There is a judge for the one who rejects <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and does not receive <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> words: The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">49</span>I have not spoken on <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> own, but the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> who sent <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> has commanded <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> what to say and how to say it.
<span class="reftext">50</span>And I know that <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> command leads to eternal life. So I speak exactly what the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> has told <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to say.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">a litra</i>; that is, approximately 12 ounces or 340 grams<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> A denarius was customarily a day’s wage for a <span class='spell ca'>labourer</span><span class='spell gb'>labourer</span><span class='spell us'>laborer</span>; see Matthew 20:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> See Deuteronomy 15:11.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Hosanna</i> is a transliteration of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Hosia-na</i>, meaning <i class="calibre6">Save, we pray</i> or <i class="calibre6">Save now</i>, which became a shout of praise; see Psalm 118:25.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Psalm 118:26<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Zechariah 9:9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">38</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Isaiah 53:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">40</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Isaiah 6:10<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
