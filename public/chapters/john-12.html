<font ><b>The Triumphal Entry</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Six days before the Passover, Jesus came
to Bethany, the hometown of Lazarus, whom He had raised from the
dead. So they hosted a dinner for Jesus there. Martha served, and
Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with Him. Then Mary
took about a pint of expensive perfume, made of pure nard, and she
anointed Jesus’ feet and wiped them with her hair. And the house
was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot,
who was going to betray Him, asked, “Why wasn’t this perfume sold
for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?” Judas
did not say this because he cared about the poor, but because he was
a thief. As keeper of the money bag, he used to take from what was
put into it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Leave her alone,”</font>
Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“She has kept this perfume in
preparation for the day of My burial. The poor you will always have
with you, but you will not always have Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews learned
that Jesus was there. And they came not only because of Him, but also
to see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead. So the chief
priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, for on account of him
many of the Jews were deserting them and believing in Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day the great crowd that had come
to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. They took palm
branches and went out to meet Him, shouting: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Hosanna!” </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Blessed is He who comes in the name of
the Lord!” </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Blessed is the King of Israel!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Finding a young donkey, Jesus sat on it,
as it is written: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >See, your King is coming, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >seated on the colt of a donkey.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At first His disciples did not understand
these things, but after Jesus was glorified they remembered what had
been done to Him, and they realized that these very things had also
been written about Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, many people continued to
testify that they had been with Jesus when He called Lazarus from the
tomb and raised him from the dead. That is also why the crowd went
out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Pharisees said to one another,
“You can see that this is doing you no good. Look how the whole
world has gone after Him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now there were some Greeks among those who
went up to worship at the feast. They came to Philip, who was from
Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested of him, “Sir, we want to see
Jesus.” Philip relayed this appeal to Andrew, and both of them went
and told Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“The
hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Truly, truly, I
tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it
remains only a seed; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Whoever
loves his life will lose it, but whoever hates his life in this world
will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves Me, he must follow
Me; and where I am, My servant will be as well. If anyone serves Me,
the Father will honor him.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Now My soul is
troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save Me from this hour’?
No, it is for this purpose that I have come to this hour. Father,
glorify Your name!” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a voice came from heaven: “I have
glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The crowd standing there heard it and said
that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In response, Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“This
voice was not for My benefit, but yours. Now judgment is upon this
world; now the prince of this world will be cast out. And I, when I
am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to Myself.”</font>
He said this to indicate the kind of death He was going to die. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The crowd replied, “We have heard from
the Law that the Christ will remain forever. So how can you say that
the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“For
a little while longer, the Light will be among you. Walk while you
have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you. The one who
walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. While you have
the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of
light.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Jesus had spoken these things, He
went away and was hidden from them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Although Jesus had performed so many signs
in their presence, they still did not believe in Him. This was to
fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Lord, who has believed our message? </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >And to whom has the arm of the Lord been
revealed?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this reason they were unable to
believe. For again, Isaiah says: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >He has blinded their eyes </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and hardened their hearts, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >so that they cannot see with their eyes, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and understand with their hearts, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and turn, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and I would heal them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Isaiah said these things because he saw
Jesus’ glory and spoke about Him. Nevertheless, many of the leaders
believed in Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess
Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue. For they
loved praise from men more than praise from God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus cried out, <font color="#a80000">“Whoever
believes in Me does not believe in Me alone, but in the One who sent
Me. And whoever sees Me sees the One who sent Me. I have come into
the world as a light, so that no one who believes in Me should remain
in darkness.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >As for anyone who
hears My words and does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I have
not come to judge the world, but to save the world. There is a judge
for the one who rejects Me and does not receive My words: The word
that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >I have not spoken on
My own, but the Father who sent Me has commanded Me what to say and
how to say it. And I know that His command leads to eternal life. So
I speak exactly what the Father has told Me to say.” </font></font>
