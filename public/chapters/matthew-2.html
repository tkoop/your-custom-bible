<font ><b>The Pilgrimage of the Magi</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in
Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east arrived in
Jerusalem, asking, “Where is the One who has been born King of the
Jews? We saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When King Herod heard this, he was
disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had assembled all
the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the
Christ was to be born. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied,
“for this is what the prophet has written: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >But you, Bethlehem, in the land of
Judah, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >are by no means least among the rulers of
Judah, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >for out of you will come a ruler </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >who will be the shepherd of My people
Israel.’” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Herod called the Magi secretly and
learned from them the exact time the star had appeared. And sending
them to Bethlehem, he said: “Go and search carefully for the Child,
and when you find Him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship
Him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After they had heard the king, they went
on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of
them until it stood over the place where the Child was. When they saw
the star, they rejoiced with great delight. On coming to the house,
they saw the Child with His mother Mary, and they fell down and
worshiped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented Him
with gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And having been warned in a dream not to
return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another route. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Magi had gone, an angel of the
Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up!” he said. “Take
the Child and His mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell
you, for Herod is going to search for the Child to kill Him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he got up, took the Child and His
mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt, where he stayed until the
death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the
prophet: “Out of Egypt I called My Son.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Herod saw that he had been outwitted
by the Magi, he was filled with rage. Sending orders, he put to death
all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and
under, according to the time he had learned from the Magi. Then what
was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >A voice is heard in Ramah, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >weeping and great mourning, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Rachel weeping for her children, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and refusing to be comforted, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >because they are no more.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Herod died, an angel of the Lord
appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt. “Get up!” he said. “Take
the Child and His mother and go to the land of Israel, for those
seeking the Child’s life are now dead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Joseph got up, took the Child and His
mother, and went to the land of Israel. But when he learned that
Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was
afraid to go there. And having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to
the district of Galilee, and he went and lived in a town called
Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: “He
will be called a Nazarene.” </font>
