<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Pilgrimage of the Magi<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Micah 5:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
<span class="reftext">2</span>asking, “Where is the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who has been born King of the Jews? We saw <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> star in the east<span class="fn">a</span>  and have come to worship <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied, “for this is what the prophet has written:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, </p><p class="indent"> are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, </p><p class="indent1"> for out of you will come a ruler </p><p class="indent"> who will be the shepherd of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people Israel.’<span class="fn">b</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then Herod called the Magi secretly and learned from them the exact time the star had appeared.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And sending them to Bethlehem, he said: “Go and search carefully for the Child, and when you find <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, report to me, so that I too may go and worship <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stood over the place where the Child was.
<span class="reftext">10</span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great delight.
<span class="reftext">11</span>On coming to the house, they saw the Child with <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mother Mary, and they fell down and worshiped <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. Then they opened their treasures and presented <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> with gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another route.
</p><p class="hdg">The Flight to Egypt<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Hosea 11:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>When the Magi had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up!” he said. “Take the Child and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mother and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the Child to kill <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So he got up, took the Child and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt,
<span class="reftext">15</span>where he stayed until the death of Herod. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> Son.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Weeping and Great Mourning<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jeremiah 31:1–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When Herod saw that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was filled with rage. Sending orders, he put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the Magi.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>“A voice is heard in Ramah, </p><p class="indent"> weeping and great mourning, </p><p class="indent1"> Rachel weeping for her children, </p><p class="indent"> and refusing to be comforted, </p><p class="indent"> because they are no more.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Return to Nazareth<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 2:39–40)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.
<span class="reftext">20</span>“Get up!” he said. “Take the Child and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mother and go to the land of Israel, for those seeking the Child’s life are now dead.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>So Joseph got up, took the Child and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mother, and went to the land of Israel.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But when he learned that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,
<span class="reftext">23</span>and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">as it rose</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Micah 5:2; see also 2 Samuel 5:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hosea 11:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Jeremiah 31:15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
