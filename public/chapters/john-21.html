<font ><b>Jesus Appears to the Disciples</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Later, by the Sea of Tiberias, Jesus again
revealed Himself to the disciples. He made Himself known in this way:
Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee,
the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. Simon
Peter told them, “I am going fishing.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >We will go with you,” they said. So
they went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the
shore, but the disciples did not recognize that it was Jesus. So He
called out to them, <font color="#a80000">“Children, do you have
any fish?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >No,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He told them, <font color="#a80000">“Cast
the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”</font>
So they cast it there, and they were unable to haul it in because of
the great number of fish. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to
Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard that it was
the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it) and
jumped into the sea. The other disciples came ashore in the boat.
They dragged in the net full of fish, for they were not far from
land, only about a hundred yards. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they landed, they saw a charcoal fire
there with fish on it, and some bread. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“Bring
some of the fish you have just caught.”</font> So Simon Peter went
aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153,
but even with so many, the net was not torn. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Come, have
breakfast,”</font> Jesus said to them. None of the disciples dared
to ask Him, “Who are You?” They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came
and took the bread and gave it to them, and He did the same with the
fish. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This was now the third time that Jesus
appeared to the disciples after He was raised from the dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they had finished eating, Jesus asked
Simon Peter, <font color="#a80000">“Simon son of John, do you love
Me more than these?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know
I love You.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Feed
My lambs.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus asked a second time, <font color="#a80000">“Simon
son of John, do you love Me?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Yes, Lord,” he answered, “You know
I love You.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus told him, <font color="#a80000">“Shepherd
My sheep.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus asked a third time, <font color="#a80000">“Simon
son of John, do you love Me?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter was deeply hurt that Jesus had asked
him a third time, <font color="#a80000">“Do you love Me?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Lord, You know all things,” he
replied. “You know I love You.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus said to him, <font color="#a80000">“Feed
My sheep.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font ><font color="#a80000">Truly, truly, I tell
you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you
wanted; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and
someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to
go.”</font> Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which
Peter would glorify God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And after He had said this, He told him,
<font color="#a80000">“Follow Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter turned and saw the disciple whom
Jesus loved following them. He was the one who had leaned back
against Jesus at the supper to ask, “Lord, who is going to betray
You?” When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“If
I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you? You follow
Me!”</font> Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers
that this disciple would not die. However, Jesus did not say that he
would not die, but only, <font color="#a80000">“If I want him to
remain until I return, what is that to you?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the disciple who testifies to
these things and who has written them down. And we know that his
testimony is true. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There are many more things that Jesus did.
If all of them were written down, I suppose that not even the world
itself would have space for the books that would be written. </font>
