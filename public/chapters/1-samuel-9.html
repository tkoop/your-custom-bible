<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font ><b>Saul Chosen as King</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now there was a Benjamite, a powerful man,
whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of
Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin. And he had a son named Saul,
choice and handsome, without equal among the Israelites—a head
taller than any of the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One day the donkeys of Saul’s father
Kish wandered off, and Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the
servants and go look for the donkeys.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Saul passed through the hill country of
Ephraim and then through the land of Shalishah, but did not find the
donkeys. He and the servant went through the region of Shaalim, but
they were not there. Then they went through the land of Benjamin, and
still they did not find them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they reached the land of Zuph, Saul
said to his servant, “Come, let us go back, or my father will stop
worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Look,” said the servant, “in this
city there is a man of God who is highly respected; everything he
says surely comes to pass. Let us go there now. Perhaps he will tell
us which way to go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >If we do go,” Saul replied, “what
can we give the man? For the bread in our packs is gone, and there is
no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The servant answered him again. “Look,”
he said, “I have here in my hand a quarter shekel of silver. I will
give it to the man of God, and he will tell us our way.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >(Formerly in Israel, a man on his way to
inquire of God would say, “Come, let us go to the seer.” For the
prophet of today was formerly called the seer.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Good,” said Saul to his servant.
“Come, let us go.” So they set out for the city where the man of
God was. And as they were climbing the hill to the city, they met
some young women coming out to draw water and asked, “Is the seer
here?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Yes, he is ahead of you,” they
answered. “Hurry now, for today he has come to the city because the
people have a sacrifice on the high place. As soon as you enter the
city, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat.
The people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the
sacrifice; after that, the guests will eat. Go up at once; you will
find him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Saul and his servant went up toward the
city, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel coming toward
them on his way up to the high place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now on the day before Saul’s arrival,
the LORD had revealed to Samuel, “At this time tomorrow I will send
you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you are to anoint him leader
over My people Israel; he will save them from the hand of the
Philistines. For I have looked upon My people, because their cry has
come to Me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him,
“Here is the man of whom I spoke; he shall rule over My people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and
asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I am the seer,” Samuel replied. “Go
up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today. And
when I send you off in the morning, I will tell you all that is in
your heart. As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry
about them, for they have been found. And upon whom is all the desire
of Israel, if not upon you and all your father’s house?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjamite from
the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the
clans of Benjamin? So why would you say such a thing to me?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Samuel took Saul and his servant,
brought them into the hall, and seated them in the place of honor
among those who were invited—about thirty in all. And Samuel said
to the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you and told you to set
aside.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the cook picked up the leg and what was
attached to it and set it before Saul. Then Samuel said, “Here is
what was kept back. It was set apart for you. Eat, for it has been
kept for you for this occasion, from the time I said, ‘I have
invited the people.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
So Saul dined with Samuel that day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And after they had come down from the high
place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof of his house.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They got up early in the morning, and just
before dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get ready, and I
will send you on your way!” So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel
went outside together. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As they were going down to the edge of the
city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us,
but you stay for a while, and I will reveal to you the word of God.”
So the servant went on. </font>
