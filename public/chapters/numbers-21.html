<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Defeat of Arad</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked Israel and captured some prisoners.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So Israel made a vow to the LORD: “If You will deliver this people into our hands, we will devote their cities to destruction.<span class="fn">a</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And the LORD heard Israel’s plea and delivered up the Canaanites. Israel devoted them and their cities to destruction; so they named the place Hormah.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Bronze Serpent</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then they set out from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea,<span class="fn">c</span>  in order to bypass the land of Edom. But the people grew impatient on the journey
<span class="reftext">5</span>and spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you led us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread or water, and we detest this wretched food!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So the LORD sent venomous snakes among the people, and many of the Israelites were bitten and died.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you. Intercede with the LORD so He will take the snakes away from us.” So Moses interceded for the people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and mount it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks at it, he will live.”
<span class="reftext">9</span>So Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it on a pole. If anyone who was bitten looked at the bronze snake, he would live.
</p><p class="hdg">The Journey to Moab</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then the Israelites set out and camped at Oboth.
<span class="reftext">11</span>They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim in the wilderness opposite Moab to the east.
<span class="reftext">12</span>From there they set out and camped in the Valley of Zered.
<span class="reftext">13</span>From there they moved on and camped on the other side of the Arnon, in the wilderness that extends into the Amorite territory. </p><p class="reg1"> Now the Arnon is the border between the Moabites and the Amorites.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore it is stated in the Book of the Wars of the LORD: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Waheb in Suphah </p><p class="indent"> and the wadis of the Arnon,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>even the slopes of the wadis </p><p class="indent"> that extend to the site of Ar </p><p class="indent"> and lie along the border of Moab.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>From there they went on to Beer,<span class="fn">d</span>  the well where the LORD said to Moses, “Gather the people so that I may give them water.”
<span class="reftext">17</span>Then Israel sang this song: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Spring up, O well, </p><p class="indent"> all of you sing to it!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>The princes dug the well; </p><p class="indent"> the nobles of the people hollowed it out </p><p class="indent1"> with their scepters </p><p class="indent"> and with their staffs.” </p><p class="reg1"> From the wilderness the Israelites went on to Mattanah,
<span class="reftext">19</span>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
<span class="reftext">20</span>and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Defeat of Sihon<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 2:24–37)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
<span class="reftext">22</span>“Let us pass through your land. We will not cut through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will stay on the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. Instead, he gathered his whole army and went out to confront Israel in the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz,<span class="fn">f</span>  he fought against Israel.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And Israel put him to the sword and took possession of his land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok—but only up to the border of the Ammonites, because it was fortified.<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its villages.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land as far as the Arnon.
<span class="reftext">27</span>That is why the poets say: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Come to Heshbon, let it be rebuilt; </p><p class="indent"> let the city of Sihon be restored.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>For a fire went out from Heshbon, </p><p class="indent"> a blaze from the city of Sihon. </p><p class="indent1"> It consumed Ar of Moab, </p><p class="indent"> the rulers of Arnon’s heights.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Woe to you, O Moab! </p><p class="indent"> You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh! </p><p class="indent1"> He gave up his sons as refugees, </p><p class="indent"> and his daughters into captivity </p><p class="indent"> to Sihon king of the Amorites.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>But we have overthrown them; </p><p class="indent"> Heshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon. </p><p class="indent1"> We demolished them as far as Nophah, </p><p class="indent"> which reaches to Medeba.<span class="fn">h</span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Defeat of Og<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 3:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>So Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
<span class="reftext">32</span>After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, Israel captured its villages and drove out the Amorites who were there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Then they turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army came out to meet them in battle at Edrei.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, along with all his people and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>So they struck down Og, along with his sons and his whole army, until no remnant was left. And they took possession of his land.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">cherem</i> refer to the giving over of things or persons to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in verse 3.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Hormah</i> means <i class="calibre6">destruction</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Sea of Reeds</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Beer</i> means <i class="calibre6">well</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Jeshimon</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">Jahaz</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jahzah</i>; see 1 Chronicles 6:78.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">because the territory was rugged</i>; literally <i class="calibre6">because it was strong</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">We demolished them until fire spread to Medeba</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
