<font ><b>The Bronze Serpent</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived
in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim,
he attacked Israel and captured some prisoners. So Israel made a vow
to the LORD: “If You will deliver this people into our hands, we
will devote their cities to destruction.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD heard Israel’s plea and
delivered up the Canaanites. Israel devoted them and their cities to
destruction; so they named the place Hormah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they set out from Mount Hor along the
route to the Red Sea, in order to bypass the land of Edom. But the
people grew impatient on the journey and spoke against God and
against Moses: “Why have you led us up out of Egypt to die in the
wilderness? There is no bread or water, and we detest this wretched
food!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the LORD sent venomous snakes among the
people, and many of the Israelites were bitten and died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the people came to Moses and said,
“We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you.
Intercede with the LORD so He will take the snakes away from us.”
So Moses interceded for the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a
fiery serpent and mount it on a pole. When anyone who is bitten looks
at it, he will live.” So Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it
on a pole. If anyone who was bitten looked at the bronze snake, he
would live. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Israelites set out and camped at
Oboth. They journeyed from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim in the
wilderness opposite Moab to the east. From there they set out and
camped in the Valley of Zered. From there they moved on and camped on
the other side of the Arnon, in the wilderness that extends into the
Amorite territory. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Arnon is the border between the
Moabites and the Amorites. Therefore it is stated in the Book of the
Wars of the LORD: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Waheb in Suphah </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and the wadis of the Arnon, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >even the slopes of the wadis </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >that extend to the site of Ar </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and lie along the border of Moab.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From there they went on to Beer, the well
where the LORD said to Moses, “Gather the people so that I may give
them water.” Then Israel sang this song: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Spring up, O well, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >all of you sing to it! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >The princes dug the well; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >the nobles of the people hollowed it out </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >with their scepters </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and with their staffs.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From the wilderness the Israelites went on
to Mattanah, and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to
Bamoth, and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah
overlooks the wasteland. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king
of the Amorites, saying, “Let us pass through your land. We will
not cut through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well.
We will stay on the King’s Highway until we have passed through
your territory.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Sihon would not let Israel pass
through his territory. Instead, he gathered his whole army and went
out to confront Israel in the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz, he
fought against Israel. And Israel put him to the sword and took
possession of his land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok—but only up to
the border of the Ammonites, because it was fortified. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Israel captured all the cities of the
Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its villages.
Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought
against the former king of Moab and taken all his land as far as the
Arnon. That is why the poets say: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Come to Heshbon, let it be rebuilt; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >let the city of Sihon be restored. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >For a fire went out from Heshbon, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >a blaze from the city of Sihon. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >It consumed Ar of Moab, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >the rulers of Arnon’s heights. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Woe to you, O Moab! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He gave up his sons as refugees, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and his daughters into captivity </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >to Sihon king of the Amorites. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >But we have overthrown them; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Heshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >We demolished them as far as Nophah, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >which reaches to Medeba.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Israel lived in the land of the
Amorites. After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, Israel captured its
villages and drove out the Amorites who were there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they turned and went up the road to
Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army came out to meet
them in battle at Edrei. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear
him, for I have delivered him into your hand, along with all his
people and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the
Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they struck down Og, along with his
sons and his whole army, until no remnant was left. And they took
possession of his land. </font>
