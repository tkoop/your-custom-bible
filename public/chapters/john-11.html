<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Death of Lazarus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>At this time a man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
<span class="reftext">2</span>(Mary, whose brother Lazarus was sick, was to anoint the Lord with perfume and wipe His feet<span class="fn">a</span>  with her hair.)
<span class="reftext">3</span>So the sisters sent word to Jesus, “Lord, the one You love is sick.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When Jesus heard this, He said, <span>“This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
<span class="reftext">6</span>So on hearing that Lazarus was sick, He stayed where He was for two days,
<span class="reftext">7</span>and then He said to the disciples, <span>“Let us go back to Judea.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>“Rabbi,” they replied, “the Jews just tried to stone You, and You are going back there?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Jesus answered, <span>“Are there not twelve hours of daylight? If anyone walks in the daytime, he will not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But if anyone walks at night, he will stumble, because he has no light.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>After He had said this, He told them, <span>“Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going there to wake him up.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>His disciples replied, “Lord, if he is sleeping, he will get better.”
<span class="reftext">13</span>They thought that Jesus was talking about actual sleep, but He was speaking about the death of Lazarus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So Jesus told them plainly, <span>“Lazarus is dead,
<span class="reftext">15</span>and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then Thomas called Didymus<span class="fn">b</span>  said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Comforts Martha and Mary</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>When Jesus arrived, He found that Lazarus had already spent four days in the tomb.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, a little less than two miles<span class="fn">c</span>  away,
<span class="reftext">19</span>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them in the loss of their brother.
<span class="reftext">20</span>So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him; but Mary stayed at home.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But even now I know that God will give You whatever You ask of Him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">23</span>“Your brother will rise again,”</span> Jesus told her.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Martha replied, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Jesus said to her, <span>“I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even though he dies.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>“Yes, Lord,” she answered, “I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>After Martha had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside to tell her, “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.”
<span class="reftext">29</span>And when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him.
<span class="reftext">31</span>When the Jews who were in the house consoling Mary saw how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.
<span class="reftext">32</span>When Mary came to Jesus and saw Him, she fell at His feet and said, “Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit<span class="fn">d</span>  and troubled.
<span><span class="reftext">34</span>“Where have you put him?”</span> He asked. </p><p class="reg1">“Come and see, Lord,” they answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Jesus wept.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>But some of them asked, “Could not this man who opened the eyes of the blind also have kept Lazarus from dying?”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Raises Lazarus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 9:36–43)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>Jesus, once again deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.
<span><span class="reftext">39</span>“Take away the stone,”</span> Jesus said. </p><p class="reg1">“Lord, by now he stinks,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man. “It has already been four days.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>So they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, <span>“Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.
<span class="reftext">42</span>I knew that You always hear Me, but I say this for the benefit of the people standing here, so they may believe that You sent Me.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>After Jesus had said this, He called out in a loud voice, <span>“Lazarus, come out!”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>The man who had been dead came out with his hands and feet bound in strips of linen, and his face wrapped in a cloth.<span class="fn">e</span>  </p><p class="reg1"><span>“Unwrap him and let him go,”</span> Jesus told them.
</p><p class="hdg">The Plot to Kill Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:1–5; Mark 14:1–2; Luke 22:1–2)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in Him.
<span class="reftext">46</span>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>Then the chief priests and Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin<span class="fn">f</span>  and said, “What are we to do? This man is performing many signs.
<span class="reftext">48</span>If we let Him go on like this, everyone will believe in Him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">49</span>But one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all!
<span class="reftext">50</span>You do not <span class='spell ca'>realize</span><span class='spell gb'>realise</span><span class='spell us'>realize</span> that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">51</span>Caiaphas did not say this on his own. Instead, as high priest that year, he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation,
<span class="reftext">52</span>and not only for the nation, but also for the scattered children of God, to gather them together into one.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">53</span>So from that day on they plotted to kill Him.
<span class="reftext">54</span>As a result, Jesus no longer went about publicly among the Jews, but He withdrew to a town called Ephraim in an area near the wilderness. And He stayed there with the disciples.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">55</span>Now the Jewish Passover was near, and many people went up from the country to Jerusalem to purify themselves before the Passover.
<span class="reftext">56</span>They kept looking for Jesus and asking one another as they stood in the temple courts,<span class="fn">g</span>  “What do you think? Will He come to the feast at all?”
<span class="reftext">57</span>But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where He was must report it, so that they could arrest Him.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">was the one having anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and having wiped His feet</i>; see John 12:3.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Didymus</i> means <i class="calibre6">the twin</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">about fifteen stadia</i>; that is, approximately 1.72 miles or 2.78 kilometers<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">He was indignant in spirit</i>; similarly in verse 38<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">44</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">soudariō</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">47</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Council</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">56</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
