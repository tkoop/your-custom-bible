His face was like the sun, and his legs were like pillars of fire.
<span class="reftext">2</span>He held in his hand a small scroll, which lay open. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then he cried out in a loud voice like the roar of a lion. And when he cried out, the seven thunders sounded their voices.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to put it in writing. But I heard a voice from <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he swore by <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> who lives forever and ever, who created <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it: “There will be no more delay!
<span class="reftext">7</span>But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be fulfilled, just as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> proclaimed to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> servants the prophets.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the voice that I had heard from <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> spoke to me again, saying, “Go, take the small scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And I went to the angel and said, “Give me the small scroll.” </p><p class="reg1">“Take it and eat it,” he said. “It will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So I took the small scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned bitter.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And they told me, “You must prophesy again about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> See Numbers 5:24 and Ezekiel 3:3.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
