<font ><b>Water from the Rock</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the whole congregation of Israel left
the Desert of Sin, moving from place to place as the LORD commanded.
They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to
drink. So the people contended with Moses, “Give us water to
drink.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >Why do you contend with me?” Moses
replied. “Why do you test the LORD?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But the people thirsted for water there,
and they grumbled against Moses: “Why have you brought us out of
Egypt—to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Moses cried out to the LORD, “What
should I do with these people? A little more and they will stone me!”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “Walk on
ahead of the people and take some of the elders of Israel with you.
Take along in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and
go. Behold, I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. And
when you strike the rock, water will come out of it for the people to
drink.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Moses did this in the sight of the
elders of Israel. He named the place Massah and Meribah because the
Israelites quarreled, and because they tested the LORD, saying, “Is
the LORD among us or not?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >After this, the Amalekites came and
attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose
some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will
stand on the hilltop with the staff of God in my hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Joshua did as Moses had instructed him and
fought against the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to
the top of the hill. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >As long as Moses held up his hands, Israel
prevailed; but when he lowered them, Amalek prevailed. When Moses’
hands grew heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat
on it. Then Aaron and Hur held his hands up, one on each side, so
that his hands remained steady until the sun went down. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his army
with the sword. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this
on a scroll as a reminder and recite it to Joshua, because I will
utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And Moses built an altar and named it The
LORD Is My Banner. “Indeed,” he said, “a hand was lifted up
toward the throne of the LORD. The LORD will war against Amalek from
generation to generation.” </font>
