<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Water from the Rock<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 20:1–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the whole congregation of Israel left the Desert of Sin,<span class="fn">a</span>  moving from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So the people contended with Moses, “Give us water to drink.” </p><p class="reg1">“Why do you contend with me?” Moses replied. “Why do you test the LORD?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But the people thirsted for water there, and they grumbled against Moses: “Why have you brought us out of Egypt—to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Moses cried out to the LORD, “What should I do with these people? A little more and they will stone me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the LORD said to Moses, “Walk on ahead of the people and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Take along in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Behold, I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb.<span class="fn">b</span>  And when you strike the rock, water will come out of it for the people to drink.” </p><p class="reg1"> So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.
<span class="reftext">7</span>He named the place Massah<span class="fn">c</span>  and Meribah<span class="fn">d</span>  because the Israelites quarreled, and because they tested the LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us or not?”
</p><p class="hdg">The Defeat of the Amalekites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>After this, the Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
<span class="reftext">9</span>So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on the hilltop with the staff of God in my hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Joshua did as Moses had instructed him and fought against the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>As long as Moses held up his hands, Israel prevailed; but when he lowered them, Amalek prevailed.
<span class="reftext">12</span>When Moses’ hands grew heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur held his hands up, one on each side, so that his hands remained steady until the sun went down.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Joshua overwhelmed Amalek and his army with the sword.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as a reminder and recite it to Joshua, because I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And Moses built an altar and named it The LORD Is My Banner.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">16</span>“Indeed,” he said, “a hand was lifted up toward the throne of the LORD. The LORD will war against Amalek from generation to generation.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> The geographical name <i class="calibre6">Sin</i> is related to <i class="calibre6">Sinai</i> and should not be mistaken for the English word <i class="calibre6">sin</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Horeb</i> is another name for Sinai.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Massah</i> means <i class="calibre6">testing</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Meribah</i> means <i class="calibre6">quarreling</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">YHWH Nissi</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
