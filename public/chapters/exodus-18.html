<font ><b>The Visit of Jethro</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, the
priest of Midian, heard about all that God had done for Moses and His
people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Moses had sent back his wife
Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro had received her, along with her
two sons. One son was named Gershom, for Moses had said, “I have
been a foreigner in a foreign land.” The other son was named
Eliezer, for Moses had said, “The God of my father was my helper
and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses’ father-in-law Jethro, along with
Moses’ wife and sons, came to him in the desert, where he was
encamped at the mountain of God. He sent word to Moses, “I, your
father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two
sons.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses went out to meet his
father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other
and went into the tent. Then Moses recounted to his father-in-law all
that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s
sake, all the hardships they had encountered along the way, and how
the LORD had delivered them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jethro rejoiced over all the good
things the LORD had done for Israel, whom He had rescued from the
hand of the Egyptians. Jethro declared, “Blessed be the LORD, who
has delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and
who has delivered the people from the hand of the Egyptians. Now I
know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for He did this
when they treated Israel with arrogance.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses’ father-in-law Jethro brought
a burnt offering and sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the
elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law in the
presence of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day Moses took his seat to judge
the people, and they stood around him from morning until evening.
When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people,
he asked, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do
you sit alone as judge, with all the people standing around you from
morning till evening?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Because the people come to me to
inquire of God,” Moses replied. “Whenever they have a dispute, it
is brought to me to judge between one man and another, and I make
known to them the statutes and laws of God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Moses’ father-in-law said to him,
“What you are doing is not good. Surely you and these people with
you will wear yourselves out, because the task is too heavy for you.
You cannot handle it alone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now listen to me; I will give you some
advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people’s
representative before God and bring their causes to Him. Teach them
the statutes and laws, and show them the way to live and the work
they must do. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Furthermore, select capable men from among
the people—God-fearing, trustworthy men who are averse to dishonest
gain. Appoint them over the people as leaders of thousands, of
hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Have these men judge the people at all
times. Then they can bring you any major issue, but all minor cases
they can judge on their own, so that your load may be lightened as
they share it with you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If you follow this advice and God so
directs you, then you will be able to endure, and all these people
can go home in peace.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses listened to his father-in-law and
did everything he said. So Moses chose capable men from all Israel
and made them heads over the people as leaders of thousands, of
hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. And they judged the people at all
times; they would bring the difficult cases to Moses, but any minor
issue they would judge themselves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his
way, and Jethro returned to his own land. </font>
