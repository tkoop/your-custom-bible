<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Birth of Isaac</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the LORD attended to Sarah as He had
said, and the LORD did for Sarah what He had promised. So Sarah
conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time
God had promised. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son
Sarah bore to him. When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham
circumcised him, as God had commanded him. Abraham was a hundred
years old when his son Isaac was born to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Sarah said, “God has made me laugh,
and everyone who hears of this will laugh with me.” She added, “Who
would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have
borne him a son in his old age.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the child grew and was weaned, and
Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the
Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking her son, and she said to
Abraham, “Expel the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s
son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now this matter distressed Abraham greatly
because it concerned his son Ishmael. But God said to Abraham, “Do
not be distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to
everything that Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring
will be reckoned. But I will also make a nation of the slave woman’s
son, because he is your offspring.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Early in the morning, Abraham got up, took
bread and a skin of water, put them on Hagar’s shoulders, and sent
her away with the boy. She left and wandered in the Wilderness of
Beersheba. When the water in the skin was gone, she left the boy
under one of the bushes. Then she went off and sat down nearby, about
a bowshot away, for she said, “I cannot bear to watch the boy die!”
And as she sat nearby, she lifted up her voice and wept. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then God heard the voice of the boy, and
the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, “What is wrong,
Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where
he lies. Get up, lift up the boy, and take him by the hand, for I
will make him into a great nation.” Then God opened her eyes, and
she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water
and gave the boy a drink. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And God was with the boy, and he grew up
and settled in the wilderness and became a great archer. And while he
was dwelling in the Wilderness of Paran, his mother got a wife for
him from the land of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Abimelech and Phicol the
commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that
you do. Now, therefore, swear to me here before God that you will not
deal falsely with me or my children or descendants. Show to me and to
the country in which you reside the same kindness that I have shown
to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Abraham replied, “I swear it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when Abraham complained to Abimelech
about a well that Abimelech’s servants had seized, Abimelech
replied, “I do not know who has done this. You did not tell me, so
I have not heard about it until today.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and
gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. Abraham
separated seven ewe lambs from the flock, and Abimelech asked him,
“Why have you set apart these seven ewe lambs?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He replied, “You are to accept the seven
ewe lambs from my hand as my witness that I dug this well.” So that
place was called Beersheba, because it was there that the two of them
swore an oath. After they had made the covenant at Beersheba,
Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army got up and returned to
the land of the Philistines. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in
Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal
God. And Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines for a long
time. </font>
