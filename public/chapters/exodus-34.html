<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">New Stone Tablets<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 10:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the originals, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Be ready in the morning, and come up on Mount Sinai to present yourself before Me on the mountaintop.
<span class="reftext">3</span>No one may go up with you; in fact, no one may be seen anywhere on the mountain—not even the flocks or herds may graze in front of the mountain.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the originals. He rose early in the morning, and taking the two stone tablets in his hands, he went up Mount Sinai as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> descended in a cloud, stood with him there, and proclaimed His name, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> passed in front of Moses and called out: </p><p class="indent1">“<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span>, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God, </p><p class="indent"> is compassionate and gracious, </p><p class="indent1"> slow to anger, </p><p class="indent"> abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>maintaining loving devotion to a thousand generations,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin. </p><p class="indent1"> Yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished; </p><p class="indent"> He will visit the iniquity of the fathers </p><p class="indent1"> on their children and grandchildren </p><p class="indent"> to the third and fourth generations.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Moses immediately bowed down to the ground and worshiped.
<span class="reftext">9</span>“O Lord,” he said, “if I have indeed found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in Your sight, my Lord, please go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our iniquity and sin, and take us as Your inheritance.”
</p><p class="hdg"><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> Renews the Covenant<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Corinthians 3:7–18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, “Behold, I am making a covenant. Before all your people I will perform wonders that have never been done in any nation in all the world. All the people among whom you live will see <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s work, for it is an awesome thing that I am doing with you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Observe what I command you this day. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Be careful not to make a treaty<span class="fn">b</span>  with the inhabitants of the land you are entering, lest they become a snare in your midst.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Rather, you must tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, and chop down their Asherah poles.
<span class="reftext">14</span>For you must not worship any other god, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you, and you will eat their sacrifices.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And when you take some of their daughters as brides for your sons, their daughters will prostitute themselves to their gods and cause your sons to do the same.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>You shall make no molten gods for yourselves.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>You are to keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread.<span class="fn">c</span>  For seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib,<span class="fn">d</span>  you are to eat unleavened bread as I commanded you. For in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>The first offspring of every womb belongs to Me, including all the firstborn males among your livestock, whether cattle or sheep.
<span class="reftext">20</span>You must redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb; but if you do not redeem it, you are to break its neck. You must redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one shall appear before Me empty-handed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Six days you shall <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even in the seasons of plowing and harvesting, you must rest.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And you are to celebrate the Feast of Weeks<span class="fn">e</span>  with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering<span class="fn">f</span>  at the turn of the year.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Three times a year all your males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel.
<span class="reftext">24</span>For I will drive out the nations before you and enlarge your borders, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to Me along with anything leavened, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God. </p><p class="reg1"> You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> also said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>So Moses was there with <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>And when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was unaware that his face had become radiant from speaking with <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Aaron and all the Israelites looked at Moses, and behold, his face was radiant. And they were afraid to approach him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>But Moses called out to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke to them.
<span class="reftext">32</span>And after this all the Israelites came near, and Moses commanded them to do everything that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had told him on Mount Sinai.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
<span class="reftext">34</span>But whenever Moses went in before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until he came out. And when he came out, he would tell the Israelites what he had been commanded,
<span class="reftext">35</span>and the Israelites would see that the face of Moses was radiant. So Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">to thousands</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">berit</i> are translated in most passages as <i class="calibre6">covenant</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, the seven-day period after the Passover during which no leaven may be eaten; see Exodus 12:14–20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Abib</i> was the first month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar, usually occurring within the months of March and April; twice in this verse.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, Shavuot, the late spring feast of pilgrimage to Jerusalem; it is also known as <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Harvest</i> (see Exodus 23:16) or <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Pentecost</i> (see Acts 2:1).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> That is, Sukkot, the autumn feast of pilgrimage to Jerusalem; it is later called <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Tabernacles</i> (or <i class="calibre6">Booths</i> or <i class="calibre6">Shelters</i>).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the Ten Words</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
