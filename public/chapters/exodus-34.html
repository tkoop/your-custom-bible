<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Chisel out
two stone tablets like the originals, and I will write on them the
words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Be ready in
the morning, and come up on Mount Sinai to present yourself before Me
on the mountaintop. No one may go up with you; in fact, no one may be
seen anywhere on the mountain—not even the flocks or herds may
graze in front of the mountain.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets
like the originals. He rose early in the morning, and taking the two
stone tablets in his hands, he went up Mount Sinai as the LORD had
commanded him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD descended in a cloud, stood
with him there, and proclaimed His name, the LORD. Then the LORD
passed in front of Moses and called out: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >The LORD, the LORD God, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >is compassionate and gracious, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >slow to anger, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >abounding in loving devotion and

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >maintaining loving devotion to a thousand
generations, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >forgiving iniquity, transgression, and
sin. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Yet He will by no means leave the guilty
unpunished; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He will visit the iniquity of the fathers </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >on their children and grandchildren </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >to the third and fourth generations.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses immediately bowed down to the ground
and worshiped. “O Lord,” he said, “if I have indeed found favor
in Your sight, my Lord, please go with us. Although this is a
stiff-necked people, forgive our iniquity and sin, and take us as
Your inheritance.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said, “Behold, I am making
a covenant. Before all your people I will perform wonders that have
never been done in any nation in all the world. All the people among
whom you live will see the LORD’s work, for it is an awesome thing
that I am doing with you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Observe what I command you this day. I
will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites,
Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. Be careful not to make a treaty
with the inhabitants of the land you are entering, lest they become a
snare in your midst. Rather, you must tear down their altars, smash
their sacred stones, and chop down their Asherah poles. For you must
not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a
jealous God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not make a covenant with the
inhabitants of the land, for when they prostitute themselves to their
gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you, and you will eat
their sacrifices. And when you take some of their daughters as brides
for your sons, their daughters will prostitute themselves to their
gods and cause your sons to do the same. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You shall make no molten gods for
yourselves. </font>

<font >You are to keep the Feast of Unleavened
Bread. For seven days at the appointed time in the month of Abib, you
are to eat unleavened bread as I commanded you. For in the month of
Abib you came out of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The first offspring of every womb belongs
to Me, including all the firstborn males among your livestock,
whether cattle or sheep. You must redeem the firstborn of a donkey
with a lamb; but if you do not redeem it, you are to break its neck.
You must redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one shall appear
before Me empty-handed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Six days you shall labor, but on the
seventh day you shall rest; even in the seasons of plowing and
harvesting, you must rest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you are to celebrate the Feast of
Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of
Ingathering at the turn of the year. Three times a year all your
males are to appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. For I
will drive out the nations before you and enlarge your borders, and
no one will covet your land when you go up three times a year to
appear before the LORD your God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to
Me along with anything leavened, and do not let any of the sacrifice
from the Passover Feast remain until morning. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Bring the best of the firstfruits of your
soil to the house of the LORD your God. </font>

<font >You must not cook a young goat in its
mother’s milk.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD also said to Moses, “Write down
these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a
covenant with you and with Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses was there with the LORD forty
days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. He
wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten
Commandments. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when Moses came down from Mount Sinai
with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was unaware
that his face had become radiant from speaking with the LORD. Aaron
and all the Israelites looked at Moses, and behold, his face was
radiant. And they were afraid to approach him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Moses called out to them; so Aaron and
all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke
to them. And after this all the Israelites came near, and Moses
commanded them to do everything that the LORD had told him on Mount
Sinai. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Moses had finished speaking with
them, he put a veil over his face. But whenever Moses went in before
the LORD to speak with Him, he would remove the veil until he came
out. And when he came out, he would tell the Israelites what he had
been commanded, and the Israelites would see that the face of Moses
was radiant. So Moses would put the veil back over his face until he
went in to speak with the LORD. </font>
