<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Chisel out
two stone tablets like the originals, and I will write on them the
words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Be ready in
the morning, and come up on Mount Sinai to present yourself before Me
on the mountaintop. No one may go up with you; in fact, no one may be
seen anywhere on the mountain—not even the flocks or herds may
graze in front of the mountain.” </font>

was radiant. So Moses would put the veil back over his face until he
went in to speak with the LORD. </font>
