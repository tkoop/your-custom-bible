<font ><b>Rahab Welcomes the Spies</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two
spies from Shittim, saying, “Go, inspect the land, especially
Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named
Rahab and stayed there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And it was reported to the king of
Jericho: “Behold, some men of Israel have come here tonight to spy
out the land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king of Jericho sent to Rahab and
said, “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house,
for they have come to spy out the whole land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the woman had taken the two men and
hidden them. So she said, “Yes, the men did come to me, but I did
not know where they had come from. At dusk, when the gate was about
to close, the men went out, and I do not know which way they went.
Pursue them quickly, and you may catch them!” (But Rahab had taken
them up to the roof and hidden them among the stalks of flax that she
had laid out there.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king’s men set out in pursuit of
the spies along the road to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as
they had gone out, the gate was shut. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Before the spies lay down for the night,
Rahab went up on the roof and said to them, “I know that the LORD
has given you this land and that the fear of you has fallen on us, so
that all who dwell in the land are melting in fear of you. For we
have heard how the LORD dried up the waters of the Red Sea before you
when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two
kings of the Amorites across the Jordan, whom you devoted to
destruction. When we heard this, our hearts melted and everyone’s
courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in the
heavens above and on the earth below. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now therefore, please swear to me by the
LORD that you will indeed show kindness to my family, because I
showed kindness to you. Give me a sure sign that you will spare the
lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who
belong to them, and that you will deliver us from death.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Our lives for your lives!” the men
agreed. “If you do not report our mission, we will show you
kindness and faithfulness when the LORD gives us the land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Rahab let them down by a rope through
the window, since the house where she lived was built into the wall
of the city. “Go to the hill country,” she said, “so that your
pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there for three days
until they have returned; then go on your way.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The men said to her, “We will not be
bound by this oath you made us swear unless, when we enter the land,
you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let
us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother and
brothers and all your family into your house. If anyone goes out the
door of your house into the street, his blood will be on his own
head, and we will be innocent. But if a hand is laid on anyone with
you in the house, his blood will be on our heads. And if you report
our mission, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Let it be as you say,” she replied,
and she sent them away. And when they had gone, she tied the scarlet
cord in the window. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the spies went out into the hill
country and stayed there three days, until their pursuers had
returned without finding them, having searched all along the road.
Then the two men started back, came down from the hill country, and
crossed the river. So they came to Joshua son of Nun and reported all
that had happened to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >The LORD has surely delivered the
entire land into our hands,” they said to Joshua. “Indeed, all
who dwell in the land are melting in fear of us.” </font>
