His disciples said to Him, “Teacher, look at the magnificent stones
and buildings!” </font>

<font >While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of
Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him
privately, “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will
be the sign that they are about to be fulfilled?” </font>

<font >Jesus began by telling them, <font color="#a80000">“See
to it that no one deceives you. Many will come in My name, claiming,
‘I am He,’ and will deceive many. When you hear of wars and
rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. These things must happen, but the
end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom
against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, as well
as famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >So be on your guard.
You will be delivered over to the councils and beaten in the
synagogues. On My account you will stand before governors and kings
as witnesses to them. And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all
the nations. But when they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry
beforehand what to say. Instead, speak whatever you are given at that
time, for it will not be you speaking, but the Holy Spirit. </font></font>

brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise against
their parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by
everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end
will be saved. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >So when you see the
abomination of desolation standing where it should not be (let the
reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the
mountains. Let no one on the housetop go back inside to retrieve
anything from his house. And let no one in the field return for his
cloak. </font></font>

days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! Pray that this will
not occur in the winter. For those will be days of tribulation
unmatched from the beginning of God’s creation until now, and never
to be seen again. If the Lord had not cut short those days, nobody
would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom He has chosen, He
has cut them short. </font></font>

his own task, and instructed the doorkeeper to keep watch. Therefore
keep watch, because you do not know when the master of the house will

or in the morning. Otherwise, he may arrive without notice and find
you sleeping. And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Keep watch!”
