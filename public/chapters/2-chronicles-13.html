<font ><b>Civil War against Jeroboam</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the eighteenth year of Jeroboam’s
reign, Abijah became king of Judah, and he reigned in Jerusalem three
years. His mother’s name was Micaiah daughter of Uriel; she was
from Gibeah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And there was war between Abijah and
Jeroboam. Abijah went into battle with an army of 400,000 chosen men,
while Jeroboam drew up in formation against him with 800,000 chosen
and mighty men of valor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the
hill country of Ephraim and said, “Hear me, O Jeroboam and all
Israel! Do you not know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given
the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a
covenant of salt? Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son
of David, rose up and rebelled against his master. Then worthless and
wicked men gathered around him to resist Rehoboam son of Solomon when
he was young, inexperienced, and unable to resist them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now you think you can resist the
kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David’s descendants.
You are indeed a vast army, and you have with you the golden calves
that Jeroboam made for you as gods. But did you not drive out the
priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites? And did you
not make priests for yourselves as do the peoples of other lands? Now
whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams
can become a priest of things that are not gods. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But as for us, the LORD is our God. We
have not forsaken Him; the priests who minister to the LORD are sons
of Aaron, and the Levites attend to their duties. Every morning and
every evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to
the LORD. They set out the rows of showbread on the ceremonially
clean table, and every evening they light the lamps of the gold
lampstand. We are carrying out the requirements of the LORD our God,
while you have forsaken Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now behold, God Himself is with us as our
head, and His priests with their trumpets sound the battle call
against you. O children of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the
God of your fathers, for you will not succeed.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to
ambush from the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah, the
ambush was behind them. When Judah turned and discovered that the
battle was both before and behind them, they cried out to the LORD.
Then the priests blew the trumpets, and the men of Judah raised the
battle cry. And when they raised the cry, God routed Jeroboam and all
Israel before Abijah and Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the Israelites fled before Judah, and
God delivered them into their hands. Then Abijah and his people
struck them with a mighty blow, and 500,000 chosen men of Israel fell
slain. Thus the Israelites were subdued at that time, and the men of
Judah prevailed because they relied on the LORD, the God of their
fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured some
cities from him: Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, along with their
villages. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jeroboam did not again recover his power
during the days of Abijah, and the LORD struck him down and he died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Abijah grew strong, married fourteen
wives, and became the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen
daughters. Now the rest of the acts of Abijah, along with his ways
and his words, are written in the Treatise of the Prophet Iddo. </font>
