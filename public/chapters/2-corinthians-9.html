<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now about the service to the saints, there
is no need for me to write to you. For I know your eagerness to help,
and I have been boasting to the Macedonians that since last year you
in Achaia were prepared to give. And your zeal has stirred most of
them to do likewise. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But I am sending the brothers in order
that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove empty,
but that you will be prepared, just as I said. Otherwise, if any
Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—to say nothing
of you—would be ashamed of having been so confident. So I thought
it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you beforehand and make
arrangements for the bountiful gift you had promised. This way, your
gift will be prepared generously and not begrudgingly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will
also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap
generously. Each one should give what he has decided in his heart to
give, not out of regret or compulsion. For God loves a cheerful
giver. And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in
all things, at all times, having all that you need, you will abound
in every good work. As it is written: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >He has scattered abroad His gifts to
the poor; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >His righteousness endures forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now He who supplies seed to the sower and
bread for food will supply and multiply your store of seed and will
increase the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in
every way to be generous on every occasion, so that through us your
giving will produce thanksgiving to God. For this ministry of service
is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also
overflowing in many expressions of thanksgiving to God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because of the proof this ministry
provides, the saints will glorify God for your obedient confession of
the gospel of Christ, and for the generosity of your contribution to
them and to all the others. And their prayers for you will express
their affection for you, because of the surpassing grace God has
given you. Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift! </font>
