<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">God Loves a Cheerful Giver<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Corinthians 16:1–4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now about the service to the saints, there is no need for me to write to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For I know <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> eagerness to help, and I have been boasting to the Macedonians that since last year <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in Achaia were prepared to give. And <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> zeal has stirred most of them to do likewise.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in this matter should not prove empty, but that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be prepared, just as I said.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> unprepared, we—to say nothing of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>—would be ashamed of having been so confident.
<span class="reftext">5</span>So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> beforehand and make arrangements for the bountiful gift you had promised. This way, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> gift will be prepared generously and not begrudgingly.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Each one should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not out of regret or compulsion. For God loves a cheerful giver.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And God is able to make all grace abound to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will abound in every good work.
<span class="reftext">9</span>As it is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">“He has scattered abroad <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> gifts to the poor; </p><p class="indent"> His righteousness endures forever.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> store of seed and will increase the harvest of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> righteousness.
<span class="reftext">11</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> will be enriched in every way to be generous on every occasion, so that through us your giving will produce thanksgiving to God.
<span class="reftext">12</span>For this ministry of service is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanksgiving to God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Because of the proof this ministry provides, the saints will glorify God for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> obedient confession of the gospel of Christ, and for the generosity of your contribution to them and to all the others.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And their prayers for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will express their affection for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, because of the surpassing grace God has given <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Thanks be to God for <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> indescribable gift!</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> See Proverbs 22:8, LXX addition.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Psalm 112:9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
