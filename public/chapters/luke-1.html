<font >Many have undertaken to compose an account
of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were
handed down to us by the initial eyewitnesses and servants of the
word. Therefore, having carefully investigated everything from the
beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for
you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of
the things you have been taught. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >In the time of Herod king of Judea there
was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division
of Abijah, and whose wife Elizabeth was a daughter of Aaron. Both of
them were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all
the commandments and decrees of the Lord. But they had no children,
because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well along in years.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >One day while Zechariah’s division was
on duty and he was serving as priest before God, he was chosen by
lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the temple
of the Lord and burn incense. And at the hour of the incense
offering, the whole congregation was praying outside. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Just then an angel of the Lord appeared to
Zechariah, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. When
Zechariah saw him, he was startled and gripped with fear. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But the angel said to him, “Do not be
afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife
Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.
He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice at his
birth, for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He shall never
take wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit
even from his mother’s womb. Many of the sons of Israel he will
turn back to the Lord their God. And he will go on before the Lord in
the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to
their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to
make ready a people prepared for the Lord.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah
asked the angel. “I am an old man, and my wife is well along in
years.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >I am Gabriel,” replied the angel. “I
stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you
and to bring you this good news. And now you will be silent and
unable to speak until the day this comes to pass, because you did not
believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Meanwhile, the people were waiting for
Zechariah and wondering why he took so long in the temple. When he
came out and was unable to speak to them, they realized he had seen a
vision in the temple. He kept making signs to them but remained
speechless. And when the days of his service were complete, he
returned home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >After these days, his wife Elizabeth
became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. She
declared, “The Lord has done this for me. In these days He has
shown me favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >In the sixth month, God sent the angel
Gabriel to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin pledged in
marriage to a man named Joseph, who was of the house of David. And
the virgin’s name was Mary. The angel appeared to her and said,
“Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Mary was greatly troubled at his words and
wondered what kind of greeting this might be. So the angel told her,
“Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. Behold,
you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to give Him
the name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the
Most High. The Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David,
and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will
never end!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >How can this be,” Mary asked the
angel, “since I am a virgin?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will
come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So
the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God. Look, even
Elizabeth your relative has conceived a son in her old age, and she
who was called barren is in her sixth month. For no word from God
will ever fail.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary
answered. “May it happen to me according to your word.” Then the
angel left her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >In those days Mary got ready and hurried
to a town in the hill country of Judah, where she entered the home of
Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting,
the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy
Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed, “Blessed are you among
women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why am I so
honored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For as soon as
the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb
leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord’s
word to her will be fulfilled.” </font>
