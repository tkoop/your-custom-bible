<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Dedication to Theophilus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 1:1–3)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Many have undertaken to compose an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,
<span class="reftext">2</span>just as they were handed down to us by the initial eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore, having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
<span class="reftext">4</span>so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
</p><p class="hdg">Gabriel Foretells John’s Birth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and whose wife Elizabeth was a daughter of Aaron.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and decrees of the Lord.
<span class="reftext">7</span>But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well along in years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>One day while Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,
<span class="reftext">9</span>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And at the hour of the incense offering, the whole congregation was praying outside.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Just then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
<span class="reftext">12</span>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and gripped with fear.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.
<span class="reftext">14</span>He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice at his birth,
<span class="reftext">15</span>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He shall never take wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Many of the sons of Israel he will turn back to the Lord their God.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children<span class="fn">a</span>  and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>“How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>“I am Gabriel,” replied the angel. “I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day this comes to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he took so long in the temple.
<span class="reftext">22</span>When he came out and was unable to speak to them, they realized he had seen a vision in the temple. He kept making signs to them but remained speechless.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And when the days of his service were complete, he returned home.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>After these days, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. She declared,
<span class="reftext">25</span>“The Lord has done this for me. In these days He has shown me favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”
</p><p class="hdg">Gabriel Foretells Jesus’ Birth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,
<span class="reftext">27</span>to a virgin pledged in marriage to a man named Joseph, who was of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary.
<span class="reftext">28</span>The angel appeared to her and said, “Greetings,<span class="fn">b</span>  you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.<span class="fn">c</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
<span class="reftext">30</span>So the angel told her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.
<span class="reftext">31</span>Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus.
<span class="reftext">32</span>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David,
<span class="reftext">33</span>and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will never end!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>“How can this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the Holy One to be born<span class="fn">d</span>  will be called the Son of God.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Look, even Elizabeth your relative has conceived a son in her old age, and she who was called barren is in her sixth month.
<span class="reftext">37</span>For no word from God will ever fail.<span class="fn">e</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>“I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May it happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel left her.
</p><p class="hdg">Mary Visits Elizabeth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>In those days Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judah,
<span class="reftext">40</span>where she entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
<span class="reftext">42</span>In a loud voice she exclaimed, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
<span class="reftext">43</span>And why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
<span class="reftext">44</span>For as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
<span class="reftext">45</span>Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord’s word to her will be fulfilled.”
</p><p class="hdg">Mary’s Song<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Samuel 2:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>Then Mary said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“My soul magnifies the Lord,
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">47</span>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">48</span>For He has looked with favor on the humble state of His servant. </p><p class="indent"> From now on all generations will call me blessed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">49</span>For the Mighty One has done great things for me. </p><p class="indent"> Holy is His name.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">50</span>His mercy extends to those who fear Him, </p><p class="indent"> from generation to generation.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">51</span>He has performed mighty deeds with His arm; </p><p class="indent"> He has scattered those who are proud </p><p class="indent"> in the thoughts of their hearts.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">52</span>He has brought down rulers from their thrones, </p><p class="indent"> but has exalted the humble.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">53</span>He has filled the hungry with good things, </p><p class="indent"> but has sent the rich away empty.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">54</span>He has helped His servant Israel, </p><p class="indent"> remembering to be merciful,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">55</span>as He promised to our fathers, </p><p class="indent"> to Abraham and his descendants forever.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">56</span>Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
</p><p class="hdg">The Birth of John the Baptist</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">57</span>When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son.
<span class="reftext">58</span>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they rejoiced with her.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">59</span>On the eighth day, when they came to circumcise the child, they were going to name him after his father Zechariah.
<span class="reftext">60</span>But his mother replied, “No! He shall be called John.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">61</span>They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who bears this name.”
<span class="reftext">62</span>So they made signs to his father to find out what he wanted to name the child.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">63</span>Zechariah asked for a tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they were all amazed.
<span class="reftext">64</span>Immediately Zechariah’s mouth was opened and his tongue was released, and he began to speak, praising God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">65</span>All their neighbors were filled with awe, and people throughout the hill country of Judea were talking about these events.
<span class="reftext">66</span>And all who heard this wondered in their hearts and asked, “What then will this child become?” For the Lord’s hand was with him.
</p><p class="hdg">Zechariah’s Song</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">67</span>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">68</span>“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, </p><p class="indent"> because He has visited and redeemed His people.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">69</span>He has raised up a horn of salvation for us </p><p class="indent"> in the house of His servant David,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">70</span>as He spoke through His holy prophets, </p><p class="indent"> those of ages past,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">71</span>salvation from our enemies </p><p class="indent"> and from the hand of all who hate us,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">72</span>to show mercy to our fathers </p><p class="indent"> and to remember His holy covenant,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">73</span>the oath He swore to our father Abraham, </p><p class="indent"> to grant us
<span class="reftext">74</span>deliverance from hostile hands, </p><p class="indent"> that we may serve Him without fear,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">75</span>in holiness and righteousness before Him </p><p class="indent"> all the days of our lives.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">76</span>And you, child, will be called </p><p class="indent"> a prophet of the Most High; </p><p class="indent1"> for you will go on before the Lord </p><p class="indent"> to prepare the way for Him,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">77</span>to give to His people the knowledge of salvation </p><p class="indent"> through the forgiveness of their sins,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">78</span>because of the tender mercy of our God, </p><p class="indent"> by which the Dawn<span class="fn">f</span>  will visit us from on high,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">79</span>to shine on those who live in darkness </p><p class="indent"> and in the shadow of death, </p><p class="indent1"> to guide our feet </p><p class="indent"> into the path of peace.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">80</span>And the child grew and became strong in spirit;<span class="fn">g</span>  and he lived in the wilderness until the time of his public appearance to Israel.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Malachi 4:5–6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Rejoice</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">Blessed are you among women!</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> TR <i class="calibre6">born of you</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">37</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">For nothing will be impossible with God.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">78</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Morning Light</i> or <i class="calibre6">the Sunrise</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">80</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the Spirit</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div>
