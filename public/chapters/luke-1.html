<span class="reftext">2</span>just as they were handed down to us by the initial eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore, having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
<span class="reftext">4</span>so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
</p><p class="hdg">Gabriel Foretells John’s Birth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and whose wife Elizabeth was a daughter of Aaron.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and decrees of the Lord.
<span class="reftext">7</span>But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well along in years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>One day while Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,
<span class="reftext">9</span>he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And at the hour of the incense offering, the whole congregation was praying outside.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Just then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
<span class="reftext">12</span>When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and gripped with fear.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.
<span class="reftext">14</span>He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice at his birth,
<span class="reftext">15</span>for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He shall never take wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> even from his mother’s womb.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Many of the sons of Israel he will turn back to the Lord their God.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children<span class="fn">a</span>  and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>“How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>“I am Gabriel,” replied the angel. “I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> this good news.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day this comes to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he took so long in the temple.
<span class="reftext">22</span>When he came out and was unable to speak to them, they <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> he had seen a vision in the temple. He kept making signs to them but remained speechless.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And when the days of his service were complete, he returned home.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>After these days, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. She declared,
<span class="reftext">25</span>“The Lord has done this for me. In these days <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has shown me <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> and taken away my disgrace among the people.”
</p><p class="hdg">Gabriel Foretells Jesus’ Birth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,
<span class="reftext">27</span>to a virgin pledged in marriage to a man named Joseph, who was of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary.
<span class="reftext">28</span>The angel appeared to her and said, “Greetings,<span class="fn">b</span>  you who are highly <span class='spell ca'>favoured</span><span class='spell gb'>favoured</span><span class='spell us'>favored</span>! The Lord is with you.<span class="fn">c</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
<span class="reftext">30</span>So the angel told her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> with God.
<span class="reftext">31</span>Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to give <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> the name Jesus.
<span class="reftext">32</span>He will be great and will be called the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span><span class='bsb'>Most</span> <span class='cap'>High</span><span class='nocap'>high</span><span class='bsb'>High</span>. The Lord God will give <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> the throne of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> father David,
<span class="reftext">33</span>and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will never end!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>“How can this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>The angel replied, “The <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> will come upon you, and the power of the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span><span class='bsb'>Most</span> <span class='cap'>High</span><span class='nocap'>high</span><span class='bsb'>High</span> will overshadow you. So the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> to be born<span class="fn">d</span>  will be called the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of God.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Look, even Elizabeth your relative has conceived a son in her old age, and she who was called barren is in her sixth month.
<span class="reftext">37</span>For no word from God will ever fail.<span class="fn">e</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>“I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May it happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel left her.
</p><p class="hdg">Mary Visits Elizabeth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>In those days Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judah,
<span class="reftext">40</span>where she entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>.
<span class="reftext">42</span>In a loud voice she exclaimed, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
<span class="reftext">43</span>And why am I so <span class='spell ca'>honoured</span><span class='spell gb'>honoured</span><span class='spell us'>honored</span>, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
<span class="reftext">44</span>For as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
<span class="reftext">45</span>Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord’s word to her will be fulfilled.”
</p><p class="hdg">Mary’s Song<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Samuel 2:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>Then Mary said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“My soul magnifies the Lord,

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">56</span>Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
</p><p class="hdg">The Birth of John the Baptist</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">57</span>When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son.
<span class="reftext">58</span>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they rejoiced with her.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">59</span>On the eighth day, when they came to circumcise the child, they were going to name him after his father Zechariah.
<span class="reftext">60</span>But his mother replied, “No! He shall be called John.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">61</span>They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who bears this name.”
<span class="reftext">62</span>So they made signs to his father to find out what he wanted to name the child.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">63</span>Zechariah asked for a tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they were all amazed.
<span class="reftext">64</span>Immediately Zechariah’s mouth was opened and his tongue was released, and he began to speak, praising God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">65</span>All their neighbors were filled with awe, and people throughout the hill country of Judea were talking about these events.
<span class="reftext">66</span>And all who heard this wondered in their hearts and asked, “What then will this child become?” For the Lord’s hand was with him.
</p><p class="hdg">Zechariah’s Song</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">67</span>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> and prophesied:
