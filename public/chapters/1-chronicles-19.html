<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>David’s Messengers Disgraced</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Some time later, Nahash king of the
Ammonites died and was succeeded by his son. And David said, “I
will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed
kindness to me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David sent messengers to console Hanun
concerning his father. But when David’s servants arrived in the
land of the Ammonites to console him, the princes of the Ammonites
said to Hanun, “Just because David has sent you comforters, do you
really believe he is showing respect for your father? Have not his
servants come to you to explore the land, spy it out, and overthrow
it?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved
their beards, cut off their garments at the hips, and sent them away.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When someone came and told David about his
men, he sent messengers to meet them, since the men had been
thoroughly humiliated. The king told them, “Stay in Jericho until
your beards have grown back, and then return.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the Ammonites realized that they had
become a stench to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand
talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from
Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah. So they hired for themselves
thirty-two thousand chariots, as well as the king of Maacah with his
troops, who came and camped near Medeba while the Ammonites came from
their cities and marched out for battle. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On hearing this, David sent Joab and the
entire army of mighty men. The Ammonites marched out and arrayed
themselves for battle at the entrance to the city, while the kings
who had come stayed by themselves in the open country. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Joab saw the battle lines before him
and behind him, he selected some of the best men of Israel and
arrayed them against the Arameans. And he placed the rest of the
forces under the command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them
against the Ammonites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">If the Arameans are too strong for me,”
said Joab, “then you will come to my rescue. And if the Ammonites
are too strong for you, then I will come to your rescue. Be strong
and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our
God. May the LORD do what is good in His sight.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Joab and his troops advanced to fight
the Arameans, who fled before him. When the Ammonites saw that the
Arameans had fled, they too fled before Joab’s brother Abishai, and
they entered the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the Arameans saw that they had been
defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to bring more Arameans from
beyond the Euphrates, with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer’s
army leading them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When this was reported to David, he
gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, advanced toward the
Arameans, and arrayed for battle against them. When David lined up to
engage them in battle, they fought against him. But the Arameans fled
before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers
and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the
commander of their army. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Hadadezer’s subjects saw that they
had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became
subject to him. So the Arameans were unwilling to help the Ammonites
anymore. </font>
