<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font ><b>The Deceit of the Gibeonites</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now when news of this reached all the
kings west of the Jordan—those in the hill country, the foothills,
and all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon (the
Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites)—
they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But the people of Gibeon, having heard
what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, acted deceptively and set out
as envoys, carrying on their donkeys worn-out sacks and old
wineskins, cracked and mended. They put worn, patched sandals on
their feet and threadbare clothing on their bodies, and their whole
supply of bread was dry and moldy. They went to Joshua in the camp at
Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a
distant land; please make a treaty with us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But the men of Israel said to the Hivites,
“Perhaps you dwell near us. How can we make a treaty with you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >We are your servants,” they said to
Joshua. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Joshua asked them, “Who are you and
where have you come from?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >Your servants have come from a very
distant land,” they replied, “because of the fame of the LORD
your God. For we have heard the reports about Him: all that He did in
Egypt, and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites beyond
the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan, who reigned
in Ashtaroth. So the elders and inhabitants of our land told us,
‘Take provisions for your journey; go to meet them and say to them:
We are your servants. Please make a treaty with us.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >This bread of ours was warm when we packed
it at home on the day we left to come to you. But take a look, it is
now dry and moldy. These wineskins were new when we filled them, but
look, they are cracked. And these clothes and sandals are worn out
from our very long journey.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the men of Israel sampled their
provisions, but did not seek the counsel of the LORD. And Joshua made
a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the
congregation swore an oath to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Three days after they had made the treaty
with the Gibeonites, the Israelites learned that they were neighbors,
living among them. So the Israelites set out and on the third day
arrived at their cities—Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and
Kiriath-jearim. But the Israelites did not attack them, because the
leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath to them by the LORD,
the God of Israel. And the whole congregation grumbled against the
leaders. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >All the leaders answered, “We have sworn
an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we cannot
touch them. This is how we will treat them: We will let them live, so
that no wrath will fall on us because of the oath we swore to them.”
They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and
water carriers for the whole congregation.” So the leaders kept
their promise. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and
said, “Why did you deceive us by telling us you live far away from
us, when in fact you live among us? Now therefore you are under a
curse and will perpetually serve as woodcutters and water carriers
for the house of my God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The Gibeonites answered, “Your servants
were told clearly that the LORD your God had commanded His servant
Moses to give you all the land and wipe out all its inhabitants
before you. So we greatly feared for our lives because of you, and
that is why we have done this. Now we are in your hands. Do to us
whatever seems good and right to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Joshua did this and delivered them from
the hands of the Israelites, and they did not kill the Gibeonites. On
that day he made them woodcutters and water carriers, as they are to
this day for the congregation of the LORD and for the altar at the
place He would choose. </font>
