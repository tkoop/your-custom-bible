<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Deceit of the Gibeonites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now when news of this reached all the kings west of the Jordan—those in the hill country, the foothills,<span class="fn">a</span>  and all along the coast of the <span class='cap'>Great</span><span class='nocap'>great</span><span class='bsb'>Great</span> <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span><span class='bsb'>Sea</span><span class="fn">b</span>  toward Lebanon (the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites)—
<span class="reftext">2</span>they came together to wage war against Joshua and Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But the people of Gibeon, having heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
<span class="reftext">4</span>acted deceptively and set out as envoys,<span class="fn">c</span>  carrying on their donkeys worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended.
<span class="reftext">5</span>They put worn, patched sandals on their feet and threadbare clothing on their bodies, and their whole supply of bread was dry and moldy.
<span class="reftext">6</span>They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant land; please make a treaty<span class="fn">d</span>  with us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you dwell near us. How can we make a treaty with you?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>“We are your servants,” they said to Joshua. </p><p class="reg1"> Then Joshua asked them, “Who are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and where have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> come from?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“Your servants have come from a very distant land,” they replied, “because of the fame of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God. For we have heard the reports about <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>: all that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> did in Egypt,
<span class="reftext">10</span>and all that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> did to the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.
<span class="reftext">11</span>So the elders and inhabitants of our land told us, ‘Take provisions for your journey; go to meet them and say to them: We are <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> servants. Please make a treaty with us.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. But take a look, it is now dry and moldy.
<span class="reftext">13</span>These wineskins were new when we filled them, but look, they are cracked. And these clothes and sandals are worn out from our very long journey.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the men of Israel sampled their provisions, but did not seek the counsel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Three days after they had made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites learned that they were neighbors, living among them.
<span class="reftext">17</span>So the Israelites set out and on the third day arrived at their cities—Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
<span class="reftext">18</span>But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath to them by <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel. And the whole congregation grumbled against the leaders.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>All the leaders answered, “We have sworn an oath to them by <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them.
<span class="reftext">20</span>This is how we will treat them: We will let them live, so that no wrath will fall on us because of the oath we swore to them.”
<span class="reftext">21</span>They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the whole congregation.” So the leaders kept their promise.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> deceive us by telling us <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> live far away from us, when in fact <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> live among us?
<span class="reftext">23</span>Now therefore <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are under a curse and will perpetually serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>The Gibeonites answered, “Your servants were told clearly that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God had commanded <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> servant Moses to give <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> all the land and wipe out all its inhabitants before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. So we greatly feared for our lives because of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and that is why we have done this.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Now we are in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>So Joshua did this and delivered them from the hands of the Israelites, and they did not kill the Gibeonites.
<span class="reftext">27</span>On that day he made them woodcutters and water carriers, as they are to this day for the congregation of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and for the altar at the place <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> would choose.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Shephelah</i> or <i class="calibre6">lowlands</i>; that is, the western foothills of Judea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, the Mediterranean Sea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">set out with provisions</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">berit</i> are translated in most passages as <i class="calibre6">covenant</i>; also in verses 7, 11, 15, and 16.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
