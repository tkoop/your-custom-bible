<font ><b>The Crime of the Benjamites</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now in those days, when there was no king
in Israel, a Levite who lived in the remote hill country of Ephraim
took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. But she was
unfaithful to him and left him to return to her father’s house in
Bethlehem in Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After she had been there four months, her
husband got up and went after her to speak kindly to her and bring
her back, taking his servant and a pair of donkeys. So the girl
brought him into her father’s house, and when her father saw him,
he gladly welcomed him. His father-in-law, the girl’s father,
persuaded him to stay, so he remained with him three days, eating,
drinking, and lodging there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the fourth day, they got up early in
the morning and prepared to depart, but the girl’s father said to
his son-in-law, “Refresh your heart with a morsel of bread, and
then you can go.” So they sat down and the two of them ate and
drank together. Then the girl’s father said to the man, “Please
agree to stay overnight and let your heart be merry.” The man got
up to depart, but his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there
that night. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the fifth day, he got up early in the
morning to depart, but the girl’s father said, “Please refresh
your heart.” So they waited until late afternoon and the two of
them ate. When the man got up to depart with his concubine and his
servant, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him, “Look,
the day is drawing to a close. Please spend the night. See, the day
is almost over. Spend the night here, that your heart may be merry.
Then you can get up early tomorrow for your journey home.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the man was unwilling to spend the
night. He got up and departed, and arrived opposite Jebus (that is,
Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine. When they
were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his
master, “Please, let us stop at this Jebusite city and spend the
night here.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But his master replied, “We will not
turn aside to the city of foreigners, where there are no Israelites.
We will go on to Gibeah.” He continued, “Come, let us try to
reach one of these towns to spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they continued on their journey, and
the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin. They stopped to go in
and lodge in Gibeah. The Levite went in and sat down in the city
square, but no one would take them into his home for the night. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That evening an old man from the hill
country of Ephraim, who was residing in Gibeah (the men of that place
were Benjamites), came in from his work in the field. When he looked
up and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, “Where
are you going, and where have you come from?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Levite replied, “We are traveling
from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote hill country of Ephraim, where
I am from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and now I am going to the
house of the LORD; but no one has taken me into his home, even though
there is both straw and feed for our donkeys, and bread and wine for
me and the maidservant and young man with me. There is nothing that
we, your servants, lack.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Peace to you,” said the old man. “Let
me supply everything you need. Only do not spend the night in the
square.” So he brought him to his house and fed his donkeys. And
they washed their feet and ate and drank. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While they were enjoying themselves,
suddenly the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on
the door, they said to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out
the man who came to your house, so we can have relations with him!”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The owner of the house went out and said
to them, “No, my brothers, do not do this wicked thing! After all,
this man is a guest in my house. Do not commit this outrage. Look,
let me bring out my virgin daughter and the man’s concubine, and
you can use them and do with them as you wish. But do not do such a
vile thing to this man.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the men would not listen to him. So
the Levite took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they
raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let
her go. Early that morning, the woman went back to the house where
her master was staying, collapsed at the doorway, and lay there until
it was light. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the morning, when her master got up and
opened the doors of the house to go out on his journey, there was his
concubine, collapsed in the doorway of the house, with her hands on
the threshold. “Get up,” he told her. “Let us go.” But there
was no response. So the man put her on his donkey and set out for
home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When he reached his house, he picked up a
knife, took hold of his concubine, cut her limb by limb into twelve
pieces, and sent her throughout the territory of Israel. And everyone
who saw it said, “Nothing like this has been seen or done from the
day the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt until this day.
Think it over, take counsel, and speak up!” </font>
