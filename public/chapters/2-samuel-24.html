</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>So the king said to Joab the commander of his army, who was with him,<span class="fn">a</span>  “Go now throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and register the troops, so that I may know their number.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But Joab replied to the king, “May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army departed from the presence of the king to count the troops of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>They crossed the Jordan and camped near Aroer, south of the town in the middle of the valley, and proceeded toward Gad and Jazer.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then they went to Gilead and the land of Tahtim-hodshi,<span class="fn">b</span>  and on to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon.
<span class="reftext">7</span>They went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to the Negev of Judah,<span class="fn">c</span>  to Beersheba.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>At the end of nine months and twenty days, having gone through the whole land, they returned to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Joab reported to the king the total number of the troops. In Israel there were 800,000 men of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span> who drew the sword, and in Judah there were 500,000.
</p><p class="hdg">Judgment for David’s Sin<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 21:7–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>After David had numbered the troops, his conscience was stricken and he said to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>When David got up in the morning, a revelation from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had come to Gad the prophet, David’s seer:
<span class="reftext">12</span>“Go and tell David that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘I am offering you three options. Choose one of them, and I will carry it out against you.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Gad went and said to David, “Do you choose to endure three<span class="fn">d</span>  years of famine in your land, three months of fleeing the pursuit of your enemies, or three days of plague upon your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should reply to Him who sent me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>David answered Gad, “I am deeply distressed. Please, let us fall into the hand of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, for His mercies are great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.”
</p><p class="hdg">A Plague on Israel<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 21:14–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> sent a plague upon Israel from that morning until the appointed time, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died.<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But when the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> relented from the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand now!” At that time the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was by the threshing floor of Araunah<span class="fn">f</span>  the Jebusite.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>When David saw the angel striking down the people, he said to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “Surely I, the shepherd,<span class="fn">g</span>  have sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Please, let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house.”
</p><p class="hdg">David Builds an Altar<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 21:18–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And that day Gad came to David and said to him, “Go up and build an altar to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”
<span class="reftext">19</span>So David went up at the word of Gad, just as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>When Araunah looked out and saw the king and his servants coming toward him, he went out and bowed facedown before the king.
<span class="reftext">21</span>“Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” Araunah said. </p><p class="reg1">“To buy your threshing floor,” David replied, “that I may build an altar to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, so that the plague upon the people may be halted.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Araunah said to David, “My lord the king may take whatever seems good and offer it up. Here are the oxen for a burnt offering and the threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood.
<span class="reftext">23</span>O king, Araunah gives all these to the king.” He also said to the king, “May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God accept you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>“No,” replied the king, “I insist on paying a price, for I will not offer to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” </p><p class="reg1"> So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And there he built an altar to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. </p><p class="reg1"> Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> answered the prayers on behalf of the land, and the plague upon Israel was halted.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">to Joab and the army commanders with him</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew; some LXX manuscripts <i class="calibre6">to Gilead and to the land of the Hittites</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">to the south of Judah</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> LXX (see also 1 Chronicles 21:12); Hebrew <i class="calibre6">seven</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">and of the people from Dan to Beersheba, seventy thousand men died</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">Araunah</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Ornan</i>; see 1 Chronicles 21:15 and 2 Chronicles 3:1.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> DSS and LXX; MT does not include <i class="calibre6">the shepherd</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">50 shekels</i> is approximately 1.26 pounds or 569.8 grams of silver.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
