Samuel 24</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>David’s Military Census</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Again the anger of the LORD burned against
Israel, and He stirred up David against them, saying, “Go and take
a census of Israel and Judah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king said to Joab the commander of
his army, who was with him, “Go now throughout the tribes of Israel
from Dan to Beersheba and register the troops, so that I may know
their number.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Joab replied to the king, “May the
LORD your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the
eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want
to do such a thing?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed
against Joab and against the commanders of the army. So Joab and the
commanders of the army departed from the presence of the king to
count the troops of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They crossed the Jordan and camped near
Aroer, south of the town in the middle of the valley, and proceeded
toward Gad and Jazer. Then they went to Gilead and the land of
Tahtim-hodshi, and on to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon. They went
toward the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and
Canaanites. Finally, they went on to the Negev of Judah, to
Beersheba. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At the end of nine months and twenty days,
having gone through the whole land, they returned to Jerusalem. And
Joab reported to the king the total number of the troops. In Israel
there were 800,000 men of valor who drew the sword, and in Judah
there were 500,000. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After David had numbered the troops, his
conscience was stricken and he said to the LORD, “I have sinned
greatly in what I have done. Now, O LORD, I beg You to take away the
iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When David got up in the morning, a
revelation from the LORD had come to Gad the prophet, David’s seer:
“Go and tell David that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am
offering you three options. Choose one of them, and I will carry it
out against you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Gad went and said to David, “Do you
choose to endure three years of famine in your land, three months of
fleeing the pursuit of your enemies, or three days of plague upon
your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should reply to
Him who sent me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">David answered Gad, “I am deeply
distressed. Please, let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for His
mercies are great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel from
that morning until the appointed time, and seventy thousand of the
people from Dan to Beersheba died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when the angel stretched out his hand
to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD relented from the calamity and said to
the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your
hand now!” At that time the angel of the LORD was by the threshing
floor of Araunah the Jebusite. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When David saw the angel striking down the
people, he said to the LORD, “Surely I, the shepherd, have sinned
and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? Please, let
Your hand fall upon me and my father’s house.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And that day Gad came to David and said to
him, “Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor
of Araunah the Jebusite.” So David went up at the word of Gad, just
as the LORD had commanded. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Araunah looked out and saw the king
and his servants coming toward him, he went out and bowed facedown
before the king. “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”
Araunah said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">To buy your threshing floor,” David
replied, “that I may build an altar to the LORD, so that the plague
upon the people may be halted.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Araunah said to David, “My lord the king
may take whatever seems good and offer it up. Here are the oxen for a
burnt offering and the threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood. O
king, Araunah gives all these to the king.” He also said to the
king, “May the LORD your God accept you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">No,” replied the king, “I insist on
paying a price, for I will not offer to the LORD my God burnt
offerings that cost me nothing.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David bought the threshing floor and
the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. And there he built an altar to
the LORD and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD answered the prayers on
behalf of the land, and the plague upon Israel was halted. </font>
