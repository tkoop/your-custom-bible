<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">David Spares Saul</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After Saul had returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.”
<span class="reftext">2</span>So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to look for David and his men in the region of the <span class='cap'>Rocks</span><span class='nocap'>rocks</span> of the Wild <span class='cap'>Goats</span><span class='nocap'>goats</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Soon Saul came to the sheepfolds along the road, where there was a cave, and he went in to relieve himself.<span class="fn">a</span>  And David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave.
<span class="reftext">4</span>So David’s men said to him, “This is the day about which <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do with him as you wish.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1"> Then David crept up secretly and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Afterward, David’s conscience was stricken because he had cut off the corner of Saul’s robe.
<span class="reftext">6</span>So he said to his men, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s anointed. May I never lift my hand against him, since he is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s anointed.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>With these words David restrained his men, and he did not let them rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went on his way.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>After that, David got up, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” </p><p class="reg1"> When Saul looked behind him, David bowed facedown in reverence
<span class="reftext">9</span>and said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Look, David intends to harm you’?
<span class="reftext">10</span>Behold, this day <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have seen with your own eyes that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> delivered you into my hand in the cave. I was told to kill you, but I spared you and said, ‘I will not lift my hand against my lord, since he is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s anointed.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>See, my father, look at the corner of your robe in my hand. For I cut it off, but I did not kill you. See and know that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands. I have not sinned against you, even though you are hunting me down to take my life.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> judge between you and me, and may <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> take vengeance on you, but my hand will never be against you.
<span class="reftext">13</span>As the old proverb says, ‘Wickedness proceeds from the wicked.’ But my hand will never be against you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?
<span class="reftext">15</span>May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> be our judge and decide between you and me. May <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> take notice and plead my case and deliver me from your hand.”
</p><p class="hdg">David’s Oath to Saul</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When David had finished saying these things, Saul called back, “Is that your voice, David my son?” </p><p class="reg1"> Then Saul wept aloud
<span class="reftext">17</span>and said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have rewarded me with good, though I have rewarded you with evil.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And you have shown this day how well you have dealt with me; for when <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> delivered me into your hand, you did not kill me.
<span class="reftext">19</span>When a man finds his enemy, does he let him go away unharmed? May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> reward you with good for what you have done for me this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now I know for sure that you will be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.
<span class="reftext">21</span>So now, swear to me by <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s house.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">cover his feet</i>, a euphemism for relieving oneself<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
