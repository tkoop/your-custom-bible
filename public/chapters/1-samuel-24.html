Samuel 24</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>David Spares Saul</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After Saul had returned from pursuing the
Philistines, he was told, “David is in the wilderness of En-gedi.”
So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to
look for David and his men in the region of the Rocks of the Wild
Goats. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Soon Saul came to the sheepfolds along the
road, where there was a cave, and he went in to relieve himself. And
David and his men were hiding in the recesses of the cave. So David’s
men said to him, “This is the day about which the LORD said to you,
‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, that you may do
with him as you wish.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David crept up secretly and cut off a
corner of Saul’s robe. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Afterward, David’s conscience was
stricken because he had cut off the corner of Saul’s robe. So he
said to his men, “The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to
my master, the LORD’s anointed. May I never lift my hand against
him, since he is the LORD’s anointed.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">With these words David restrained his men,
and he did not let them rise up against Saul. Then Saul left the cave
and went on his way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After that, David got up, went out of the
cave, and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Saul looked behind him, David bowed
facedown in reverence and said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the
words of men who say, ‘Look, David intends to harm you’? Behold,
this day you have seen with your own eyes that the LORD delivered you
into my hand in the cave. I was told to kill you, but I spared you
and said, ‘I will not lift my hand against my lord, since he is the
LORD’s anointed.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">See, my father, look at the corner of your
robe in my hand. For I cut it off, but I did not kill you. See and
know that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands. I have not
sinned against you, even though you are hunting me down to take my
life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">May the LORD judge between you and me, and
may the LORD take vengeance on you, but my hand will never be against
you. As the old proverb says, ‘Wickedness proceeds from the
wicked.’ But my hand will never be against you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Against whom has the king of Israel come
out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? May the LORD be our
judge and decide between you and me. May He take notice and plead my
case and deliver me from your hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When David had finished saying these
things, Saul called back, “Is that your voice, David my son?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Saul wept aloud and said to David,
“You are more righteous than I, for you have rewarded me with good,
though I have rewarded you with evil. And you have shown this day how
well you have dealt with me; for when the LORD delivered me into your
hand, you did not kill me. When a man finds his enemy, does he let
him go away unharmed? May the LORD reward you with good for what you
have done for me this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now I know for sure that you will be king,
and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. So
now, swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants
or wipe out my name from my father’s house.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul
returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. </font>
