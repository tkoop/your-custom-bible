<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Pharaoh’s First Refusal</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After that, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people go, so that they may hold a feast to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> in the wilderness.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>But Pharaoh replied, “Who is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> that I should obey <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> voice and let Israel go? I do not know <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and I will not let Israel go.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>“The God of the Hebrews has met with us,” they answered. “Please let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God, or <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> may strike us with plagues or with the sword.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get back to your <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>!”
<span class="reftext">5</span>Pharaoh also said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you would be stopping them from their <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>.”
</p><p class="hdg">Bricks and Straw</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen:
<span class="reftext">7</span>“You shall no longer supply the people with straw for making bricks. They must go and gather their own straw.
<span class="reftext">8</span>But require of them the same quota of bricks as before; do not reduce it. For they are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’
<span class="reftext">9</span>Make the work harder on the men so they will be occupied and pay no attention to these lies.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So the taskmasters and foremen of the people went out and said to them, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I am no longer giving you straw.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it; but your workload will in no way be reduced.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So the people scattered all over the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
<span class="reftext">13</span>The taskmasters kept pressing them, saying, “Fulfill your quota each day, just as you did when straw was provided.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the Israelite foremen, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over the people, were beaten and asked, “Why have you not fulfilled your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as you did before?”
</p><p class="hdg">The Cry of the Israelites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why are you treating your servants this way?
<span class="reftext">16</span>No straw has been given to your servants, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Look, your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>“You are slackers!” Pharaoh replied. “Slackers! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.’
<span class="reftext">18</span>Now get to work. You will be given no straw, yet you must deliver the full quota of bricks.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>The Israelite foremen <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks.”
<span class="reftext">20</span>When they left Pharaoh, they confronted Moses and Aaron, who stood waiting to meet them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>“May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> look upon you and judge you,” the foremen said, “for you have made us a stench before Pharaoh and his officials; you have placed in their hand a sword to kill us!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So Moses returned to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and asked, “Lord, why have <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> brought trouble upon this people? Is this why <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> sent me?
<span class="reftext">23</span>Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> name, he has brought trouble on this people, and <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have not delivered <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> people in any way.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
