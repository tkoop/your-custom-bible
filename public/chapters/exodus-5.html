<font face="Tahoma, serif">After that, Moses and Aaron went to
Pharaoh and said, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:
‘Let My people go, so that they may hold a feast to Me in the
wilderness.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Pharaoh replied, “Who is the LORD
that I should obey His voice and let Israel go? I do not know the
LORD, and I will not let Israel go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">The God of the Hebrews has met with
us,” they answered. “Please let us go on a three-day journey into
the wilderness to sacrifice to the LORD our God, or He may strike us
with plagues or with the sword.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses
and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get back
to your labor!” Pharaoh also said, “Look, the people of the land
are now numerous, and you would be stopping them from their labor.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">That same day Pharaoh commanded the
taskmasters of the people and their foremen: “You shall no longer
supply the people with straw for making bricks. They must go and
gather their own straw. But require of them the same quota of bricks
as before; do not reduce it. For they are lazy; that is why they are
crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ Make the work
harder on the men so they will be occupied and pay no attention to
these lies.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the taskmasters and foremen of the
people went out and said to them, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I
am no longer giving you straw. Go and get your own straw wherever you
can find it; but your workload will in no way be reduced.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the people scattered all over the land
of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. The taskmasters kept pressing
them, saying, “Fulfill your quota each day, just as you did when
straw was provided.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Israelite foremen, whom Pharaoh’s
taskmasters had set over the people, were beaten and asked, “Why
have you not fulfilled your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as
you did before?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the Israelite foremen went and appealed
to Pharaoh: “Why are you treating your servants this way? No straw
has been given to your servants, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’
Look, your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own
people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You are slackers!” Pharaoh replied.
“Slackers! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice
to the LORD.’ Now get to work. You will be given no straw, yet you
must deliver the full quota of bricks.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Israelite foremen realized they were
in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce your daily
quota of bricks.” When they left Pharaoh, they confronted Moses and
Aaron, who stood waiting to meet them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">May the LORD look upon you and judge
you,” the foremen said, “for you have made us a stench before
Pharaoh and his officials; you have placed in their hand a sword to
kill us!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Moses returned to the LORD and asked,
“Lord, why have You brought trouble upon this people? Is this why
You sent me? Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he
has brought trouble on this people, and You have not delivered Your
people in any way.” </font>
