<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Complaint of Miriam and Aaron</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because of the Cushite woman he had married, for he had taken a Cushite wife.
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Does <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> speak only through Moses?” they said. “Does <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> not also speak through us?” And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> heard this.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Now Moses was a very humble man, more so than any man on the face of the earth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And suddenly <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “You three, come out to the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span>.” So the three went out,
<span class="reftext">5</span>and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came down in a pillar of cloud, stood at the entrance to the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span>, and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them had stepped forward,
<span class="reftext">6</span><span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said, “Hear now <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> words: </p><p class="indent1stline"> If there is a prophet among you, </p><p class="indent"> I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, will reveal <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span> to him in a vision; </p><p class="indent"> I will speak to him in a dream.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>But this is not so with <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> servant Moses; </p><p class="indent"> he is faithful in all <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> house.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>I speak with him face to face, </p><p class="indent"> clearly and not in riddles; </p><p class="indent"> he sees the form of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. </p><p class="reg1"> Why then were you unafraid to speak against <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> servant Moses?”
<span class="reftext">9</span>So the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against them, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> departed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>As the cloud lifted from above the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span>, suddenly Miriam became leprous,<span class="fn">b</span>  white as snow. Aaron turned toward her, saw that she was leprous,
<span class="reftext">11</span>and said to Moses, “My lord, please do not hold against us this sin we have so foolishly committed.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Please do not let her be like a stillborn infant whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Moses cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “O God, please heal her!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> answered Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days; after that she may be brought back in.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought in again.
<span class="reftext">16</span>After that, the people set out from Hazeroth and camped in the <span class='cap'>Wilderness</span><span class='nocap'>wilderness</span> of Paran.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in Hebrews 3:5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> The Hebrew word traditionally translated as <i class="calibre6">leprous</i> was used for various skin diseases; see Leviticus 13.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
