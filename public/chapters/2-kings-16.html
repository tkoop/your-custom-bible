Kings 16</b></font></font></font></p>

<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Idolatry of Ahaz</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of
Remaliah, Ahaz son of Jotham became king of Judah. Ahaz was twenty
years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen
years. And unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in
the eyes of the LORD his God. Instead, he walked in the ways of the
kings of Israel and even sacrificed his son in the fire, according to
the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before
the Israelites. And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high
places, on the hills, and under every green tree. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of
Remaliah king of Israel came up to wage war against Jerusalem. They
besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered
Elath for Aram, drove out the men of Judah, and sent the Edomites
into Elath, where they live to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser
king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your son. Come up
and save me from the hands of the kings of Aram and Israel, who are
rising up against me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ahaz also took the silver and gold found
in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries of the king’s
palace, and he sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria. So the king
of Assyria responded to him, marched up to Damascus, and captured it.
He took its people to Kir as captives and put Rezin to death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet
Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria. On seeing the altar in Damascus,
King Ahaz sent Uriah the priest a model of the altar and complete
plans for its construction. And Uriah the priest built the altar
according to all the instructions King Ahaz had sent from Damascus,
and he completed it by the time King Ahaz had returned. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the king came back from Damascus and
saw the altar, he approached it and presented offerings on it. He
offered his burnt offering and his grain offering, poured out his
drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the
altar. He also took the bronze altar that stood before the LORD from
the front of the temple (between the new altar and the house of the
LORD) and he put it on the north side of the new altar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest,
“Offer on the great altar the morning burnt offering, the evening
grain offering, and the king’s burnt offering and grain offering,
as well as the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings
of all the people of the land. Sprinkle on the altar all the blood of
the burnt offerings and sacrifices. But I will use the bronze altar
to seek guidance.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Uriah the priest did just as King Ahaz
had commanded. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">King Ahaz also cut off the frames of the
movable stands and removed the bronze basin from each of them. He
took down the Sea from the bronze oxen that were under it and put it
on a stone base. And on account of the king of Assyria, he removed
the Sabbath canopy they had built in the temple and closed the royal
entryway outside the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As for the rest of the acts of Ahaz, along
with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the
Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Ahaz rested with his fathers and was
buried with them in the City of David, and his son Hezekiah reigned
in his place. </font>
