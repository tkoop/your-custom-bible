</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>For resentment kills a fool, </p><p class="indent"> and envy slays the simple.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>I have seen a fool taking root, </p><p class="indent"> but suddenly his house was cursed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>His sons are far from safety, </p><p class="indent"> crushed in court without a defender.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The hungry consume his harvest, </p><p class="indent"> taking it even from the thorns, </p><p class="indent"> and the thirsty pant after his wealth.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For distress does not spring from the dust, </p><p class="indent"> and trouble does not sprout from the ground.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Yet man is born to trouble </p><p class="indent"> as surely as sparks fly upward.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>However, if I were you, I would appeal to God </p><p class="indent"> and lay my cause before Him—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>the One who does great and unsearchable things, </p><p class="indent"> wonders without number.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>He gives rain to the earth </p><p class="indent"> and sends water upon the fields.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>He sets the lowly on high, </p><p class="indent"> so that mourners are lifted to safety.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>He thwarts the schemes of the crafty, </p><p class="indent"> so that their hands find no success.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>He catches the wise in their craftiness,<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and sweeps away the plans of the cunning.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>They encounter darkness by day </p><p class="indent"> and grope at noon as in the night.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth </p><p class="indent"> and from the clutches of the powerful.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So the poor have hope, </p><p class="indent"> and injustice shuts its mouth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>Blessed indeed is the man whom God corrects; </p><p class="indent"> so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>For He wounds, but He also binds; </p><p class="indent"> He strikes, but His hands also heal.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>He will rescue you from six calamities; </p><p class="indent"> no harm will touch you in seven.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>In famine He will redeem you from death, </p><p class="indent"> and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, </p><p class="indent"> and will not fear havoc when it comes.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>You will laugh at destruction and famine, </p><p class="indent"> and need not fear the beasts of the earth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, </p><p class="indent"> and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>You will know that your tent is secure, </p><p class="indent"> and find nothing amiss when inspecting your home.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>You will know that your offspring will be many, </p><p class="indent"> your descendants like the grass of the earth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>You will come to the grave in full <span class='spell ca'>vigour</span><span class='spell gb'>vigour</span><span class='spell us'>vigor</span>, </p><p class="indent"> like a sheaf of grain gathered in season.
