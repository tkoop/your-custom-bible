</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers and instructed them: “Go inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this injury.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are on <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> way to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?’
<span class="reftext">4</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘You will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1"> So Elijah departed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, “Why have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> returned?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>They replied, “A man came up to meet us and said, ‘Go back to the king who sent <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and tell him that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending these men to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>The king asked them, “What sort of man came up to meet you and spoke these words to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>“He was a hairy man,<span class="fn">a</span>” they answered, “with a leather belt around his waist.” </p><p class="reg1">“It was Elijah the Tishbite,” said the king.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then King Ahaziah sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. So the captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on top of a hill, and said to him, “Man of God, the king declares, ‘Come down!’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> and consume you and your fifty men.” </p><p class="reg1"> And fire came down from <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> and consumed the captain and his fifty men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. And the captain said to Elijah, “Man of God, the king declares, ‘Come down at once!’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Again Elijah replied, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> and consume you and your fifty men.” </p><p class="reg1"> And the fire of God came down from <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> and consumed the captain and his fifty men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. And the third captain went up, fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, “Man of God, may my life and the lives of these fifty servants please be precious in your sight.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Behold, fire has come down from <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> and consumed the first two captains of fifty, with all their men. But now may my life be precious in your sight.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him.” </p><p class="reg1"> So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And Elijah said to King Ahaziah, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: Is there really no God in Israel for you to inquire of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> word? Is that why you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jehoram Succeeds Ahaziah</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So Ahaziah died according to the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> that Elijah had spoken. And since he had no son, Jehoram<span class="fn">b</span>  succeeded him in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat over Judah.
