<font ><b>Elijah Denounces Ahaziah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled
against Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice
of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent
messengers and instructed them: “Go inquire of Baal-zebub, the god
of Ekron, whether I will recover from this injury.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah
the Tishbite, “Go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria
and ask them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are
on your way to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?’ Therefore
this is what the LORD says: ‘You will not get up from the bed on
which you are lying. You will surely die.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Elijah departed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When the messengers returned to the king,
he asked them, “Why have you returned?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >They replied, “A man came up to meet us
and said, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him that this
is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that
you are sending these men to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?
Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying.
You will surely die.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The king asked them, “What sort of man
came up to meet you and spoke these words to you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >He was a hairy man,” they answered,
“with a leather belt around his waist.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >It was Elijah the Tishbite,” said the
king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then King Ahaziah sent to Elijah a captain
with his company of fifty men. So the captain went up to Elijah, who
was sitting on top of a hill, and said to him, “Man of God, the
king declares, ‘Come down!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a
man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your
fifty men.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And fire came down from heaven and
consumed the captain and his fifty men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So the king sent to Elijah another captain
with his fifty men. And the captain said to Elijah, “Man of God,
the king declares, ‘Come down at once!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Again Elijah replied, “If I am a man of
God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty
men.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And the fire of God came down from heaven
and consumed the captain and his fifty men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So the king sent a third captain with his
fifty men. And the third captain went up, fell on his knees before
Elijah, and begged him, “Man of God, may my life and the lives of
these fifty servants please be precious in your sight. Behold, fire
has come down from heaven and consumed the first two captains of
fifty, with all their men. But now may my life be precious in your
sight.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah,
“Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Elijah got up and went down with him to
the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And Elijah said to King Ahaziah, “This
is what the LORD says: Is there really no God in Israel for you to
inquire of His word? Is that why you have sent messengers to inquire
of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not get up from
the bed on which you are lying. You will surely die.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Ahaziah died according to the word of
the LORD that Elijah had spoken. And since he had no son, Jehoram
succeeded him in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of
Jehoshaphat over Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Ahaziah,
along with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of
the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? </font>
