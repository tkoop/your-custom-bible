<span class="reftext">2</span>And when the locusts had eaten every green plant in the land, I said, “Lord GOD, please forgive! How will Jacob survive, since he is so small?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> relented from this plan. “It will not happen,” He said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>This is what the Lord GOD showed me: The Lord GOD was calling for <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> by fire. It consumed the great deep and devoured the land.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then I said, “Lord GOD, please stop! How will Jacob survive, since he is so small?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> relented from this plan. “It will not happen either,” said the Lord GOD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>This is what He showed me: Behold, the Lord was standing by a wall true to plumb, with a plumb line in His hand.
<span class="reftext">8</span>“Amos, what do you see?” asked <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. </p><p class="reg1">“A plumb line,” I replied. </p><p class="reg1">“Behold,” said the Lord, “I am setting a plumb line among My people Israel; I will no longer spare them:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>The high places of Isaac will be deserted, </p><p class="indent"> and the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste; </p><p class="indent1"> and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam </p><p class="indent"> with My sword.”
</p><p class="hdg">Amaziah Accuses Amos</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words,
<span class="reftext">11</span>for this is what Amos has said: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, </p><p class="indent"> and Israel will surely go into exile, </p><p class="indent"> away from their homeland.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And Amaziah said to Amos, “Go away, you seer! Flee to the land of Judah; earn your bread there and do your prophesying there.
<span class="reftext">13</span>But never prophesy at Bethel again, because it is the sanctuary of the king and the temple of the kingdom.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>“I was not<span class="fn">b</span>  a prophet,” Amos replied, “nor was I the son<span class="fn">c</span>  of a prophet; rather, I was a herdsman and a tender of sycamore-fig trees.
<span class="reftext">15</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> took me from following the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Now, therefore, hear the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. You say: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Do not prophesy against Israel; </p><p class="indent"> do not preach against the house of Isaac.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, </p><p class="indent"> and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword. </p><p class="indent1"> Your land will be divided by a measuring line, </p><p class="indent"> and you yourself will die on pagan<span class="fn">d</span>  soil. </p><p class="indent1"> And Israel will surely go into exile, </p><p class="indent"> away from their homeland.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">A swarm of locusts coming from the east; and, behold, one grasshopper, king Gog.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">I am not</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">nor am I the son</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">unclean</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
