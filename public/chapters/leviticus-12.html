<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to the
Israelites, ‘A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son
will be unclean for seven days, as she is during the days of her
menstruation. And on the eighth day the flesh of the boy’s foreskin
is to be circumcised. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">

from her bleeding for thirty-three days. She must not touch anything
sacred or go into the sanctuary until the days of her purification
are complete. </font>

<font >If, however, she gives birth to a
daughter, the woman will be unclean for two weeks as she is during
her menstruation. Then she must continue in purification from her
bleeding for sixty-six days. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the days of her purification are
complete, whether for a son or for a daughter, she is to bring to the
priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a year-old lamb for a
burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering.
And the priest will present them before the LORD and make atonement
for her; and she shall be ceremonially cleansed from her flow of
blood. This is the law for a woman giving birth, whether to a male or
to a female. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if she cannot afford a lamb, she shall
bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering
and the other for a sin offering. Then the priest will make atonement
for her, and she will be clean.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
