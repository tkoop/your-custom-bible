<span class="reftext">2</span>Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has chosen them to carry the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and to minister before Him forever.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to the place he had prepared for it.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then he gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>From the Kohathites, Uriel the chief and 120 of his relatives;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>from the Merarites, Asaiah the chief and 220 of his relatives;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>from the Gershomites,<span class="fn">a</span>  Joel the chief and 130 of his relatives;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>from the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah the chief and 200 of his relatives;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>from the Hebronites, Eliel the chief and 80 of his relatives;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>and from the Uzzielites, Amminadab the chief and 112 of his relatives.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And he said to them, “You are the heads of the Levitical families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves so that you may bring the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.
<span class="reftext">13</span>It was because you Levites were not with us the first time that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God burst forth in anger against us. For we did not consult Him about the proper order.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Priests and Levites Carry the Ark</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>David also told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their relatives as singers to lift up their voices with joy, accompanied by musical instruments—harps, lyres, and cymbals.
<span class="reftext">17</span>So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his brothers, Asaph son of Berechiah; from their brothers the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah;
<span class="reftext">18</span>and with them their brothers next in rank: Zechariah,<span class="fn">b</span>  Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Zechariah, Aziel,<span class="fn">d</span>  Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the harps according to Alamoth.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead the music with lyres according to Sheminith.<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Chenaniah the head Levite was the director of the music because he was highly skilled.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Berechiah and Elkanah were to be guardians<span class="fn">g</span>  of the ark.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer—the priests—were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also to be guardians of the ark.
</p><p class="hdg">Moving the Ark to Jerusalem</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>So David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands went with rejoicing to bring the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> from the house of Obed-edom.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Now David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, as well as the singers and Chenaniah, the director of music for the singers. David also wore a linen ephod.
<span class="reftext">28</span>So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> with shouting, with the sounding of rams’ horns and trumpets, and with cymbals and the music of harps and lyres.
