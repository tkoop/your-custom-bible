<font face="Tahoma, serif">David constructed buildings for himself in
the City of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and
pitched a tent for it. Then David said, “No one but the Levites may
carry the ark of God, because the LORD has chosen them to carry the
ark of the LORD and to minister before Him forever.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And David assembled all Israel in
Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place he had
prepared for it. Then he gathered together the descendants of Aaron
and the Levites: </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">David summoned the priests Zadok and
Abiathar and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and
Amminadab. And he said to them, “You are the heads of the Levitical
families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves so that
you may bring the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I
have prepared for it. It was because you Levites were not with us the
first time that the LORD our God burst forth in anger against us. For
we did not consult Him about the proper order.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the priests and Levites consecrated
themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel. And
the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles,
as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">David also told the leaders of the Levites
to appoint their relatives as singers to lift up their voices with
joy, accompanied by musical instruments—harps, lyres, and cymbals.
So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his brothers, Asaph
son of Berechiah; from their brothers the Merarites, Ethan son of
Kushaiah; and with them their brothers next in rank: Zechariah,
Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah,
Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and
Jeiel. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The musicians Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were
to sound the bronze cymbals. Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel,
Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play the harps according
to Alamoth. And Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel,
and Azaziah were to lead the music with lyres according to Sheminith.
Chenaniah the head Levite was the director of the music because he
was highly skilled. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Berechiah and Elkanah were to be guardians
of the ark. Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah,
Benaiah, and Eliezer—the priests—were to blow the trumpets before
the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also to be guardians of the
ark. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David, the elders of Israel, and the
commanders of thousands went with rejoicing to bring the ark of the
covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom. And because God
helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the
LORD, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now David was dressed in a robe of fine
linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, as well as
the singers and Chenaniah, the director of music for the singers.
David also wore a linen ephod. So all Israel brought up the ark of
the covenant of the LORD with shouting, with the sounding of rams’
horns and trumpets, and with cymbals and the music of harps and
lyres. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As the ark of the covenant of the LORD was
entering the City of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from
a window and saw King David dancing and celebrating, and she despised
him in her heart. </font>
