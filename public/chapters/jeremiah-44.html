<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Judgment on the Jews in Egypt</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is the word that came to Jeremiah
concerning all the Jews living in the land of Egypt—in Migdol,
Tahpanhes, and Memphis—and in the land of Pathros: “This is what
the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You have seen all the
disaster that I brought against Jerusalem and all the cities of
Judah; and behold, they lie today in ruins and desolation because of
the evil they have done. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They provoked Me to anger by continuing to
burn incense and to serve other gods that neither they nor you nor
your fathers ever knew. Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets
again and again, saying: ‘Do not do this detestable thing that I
hate.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But they did not listen or incline their
ears; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense
to other gods. Therefore My wrath and anger poured out and burned in
the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so that they
have become the desolate ruin they are today. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So now, this is what the LORD God of
Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Why are you doing such great harm to
yourselves by cutting off from Judah man and woman, child and infant,
leaving yourselves without a remnant? Why are you provoking Me to
anger by the work of your hands by burning incense to other gods in
the land of Egypt, where you have gone to reside? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As a result, you will be cut off and will
become an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations of the
earth. Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and of the
kings of Judah and their wives, as well as the wickedness that you
and your wives committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of
Jerusalem? To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown
reverence, nor have they followed My instruction or the statutes that
I set before you and your fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts,
the God of Israel, says: I will set My face to bring disaster and to
cut off all Judah. And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have
resolved to go to the land of Egypt to reside there; they will meet
their end. They will all fall by the sword or be consumed by famine.
From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine; and
they will become an object of cursing and horror, of vilification and
reproach. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will punish those who live in the land
of Egypt, just as I punished Jerusalem, by sword and famine and
plague, so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone to reside
in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, where
they long to return and live; for none will return except a few
fugitives.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all the men who knew that their wives
were burning incense to other gods, and all the women standing by—a
great assembly—along with all the people living in the land of
Egypt and in Pathros, said to Jeremiah, “As for the word you have
spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you!
Instead, we will do everything we vowed to do: We will burn incense
to the Queen of Heaven and offer drink offerings to her, just as we,
our fathers, our kings, and our officials did in the cities of Judah
and in the streets of Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time we had plenty of food and
good things, and we saw no disaster. But from the time we stopped
burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink
offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been perishing
by sword and famine.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moreover,” said the women, “when we
burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings
to her, was it without our husbands’ knowledge that we made
sacrificial cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to
her?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both
men and women, who were answering him, “As for the incense you
burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—you,
your fathers, your kings, your officials, and the people of the
land—did the LORD not remember and bring this to mind? So the LORD
could no longer endure the evil deeds and detestable acts you
committed, and your land became a desolation, a horror, and an object
of cursing, without inhabitant, as it is this day. Because you burned
incense and sinned against the LORD, and did not obey the voice of
the LORD or walk in His instruction, His statutes, and His
testimonies, this disaster has befallen you, as you see today.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jeremiah said to all the people,
including all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all those of
Judah who are in the land of Egypt. This is what the LORD of Hosts,
the God of Israel, says: As for you and your wives, you have spoken
with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands your words: ‘We will
surely perform our vows that we have made to burn incense to the
Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.’ Go ahead,
then, do what you have promised! Keep your vows! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nevertheless, hear the word of the LORD,
all you people of Judah living in Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by My
great name, says the LORD, that never again will any man of Judah
living in the land of Egypt invoke My name or say, ‘As surely as
the Lord GOD lives.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am watching over them for harm and not
for good, and every man of Judah who is in the land of Egypt will
meet his end by sword or famine, until they are finished off. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Those who escape the sword will return
from Egypt to Judah, few in number, and the whole remnant of Judah
who went to dwell in the land of Egypt will know whose word will
stand, Mine or theirs! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This will be a sign to you that I will
punish you in this place, declares the LORD, so that you may know
that My threats of harm against you will surely stand. This is what
the LORD says: Behold, I will deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt
into the hands of his enemies who seek his life, just as I delivered
Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon, the enemy who was seeking his life.” </font>
