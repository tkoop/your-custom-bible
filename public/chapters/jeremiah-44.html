<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Judgment on the Jews in Egypt</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in the land of Egypt<span class="fn">a</span>—in Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis<span class="fn">b</span>—and in the land of Pathros:<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">2</span>“This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have seen all the disaster that I brought against Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah; and behold, they lie today in ruins and desolation
<span class="reftext">3</span>because of the evil they have done. </p><p class="reg1"> They provoked <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to anger by continuing to burn incense and to serve other gods that neither they nor <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> nor <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers ever knew.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Yet I sent <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> all <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> servants the prophets again and again,<span class="fn">d</span>  saying: ‘Do not do this detestable thing that I hate.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But they did not listen or incline their ears; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> wrath and anger poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so that they have become the desolate ruin they are today.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>So now, this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Why are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> doing such great harm to yourselves by cutting off from Judah man and woman, child and infant, leaving yourselves without a remnant?
<span class="reftext">8</span>Why are you provoking <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to anger by the work of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hands by burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have gone to reside? </p><p class="reg1"> As a result, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be cut off and will become an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations of the earth.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> forgotten the wickedness of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers and of the kings of Judah and their wives, as well as the wickedness that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> wives committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
<span class="reftext">10</span>To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> instruction or the statutes that I set before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will set <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> face to bring disaster and to cut off all Judah.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have resolved to go to the land of Egypt to reside there; they will meet their end. They will all fall by the sword or be consumed by famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine; and they will become an object of cursing and horror, of vilification and reproach.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, just as I punished Jerusalem, by sword and famine and plague,
<span class="reftext">14</span>so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone to reside in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, where they long to return and live; for none will return except a few fugitives.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Stubbornness of the People</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, and all the women standing by—a great assembly—along with all the people living in the land of Egypt and in Pathros,<span class="fn">e</span>  said to Jeremiah,
<span class="reftext">16</span>“As for the word you have spoken to us in the name of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, we will not listen to you!
<span class="reftext">17</span>Instead, we will do everything we vowed to do: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and offer drink offerings to her, just as we, our fathers, our kings, and our officials did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. </p><p class="reg1"> At that time we had plenty of food and good things, and we saw no disaster.
<span class="reftext">18</span>But from the time we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been perishing by sword and famine.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>“Moreover,” said the women, “when we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands’ knowledge that we made sacrificial cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her?”
</p><p class="hdg">Calamity for the Jews</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him,
<span class="reftext">21</span>“As for the incense you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem—<span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> kings, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> officials, and the people of the land—did <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> not remember and bring this to mind?
<span class="reftext">22</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> could no longer endure the evil deeds and detestable acts <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> committed, and your land became a desolation, a horror, and an object of cursing, without inhabitant, as it is this day.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> burned incense and sinned against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and did not obey the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> or walk in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> instruction, <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> statutes, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> testimonies, this disaster has befallen you, as you see today.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, all those of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">25</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: As for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> wives, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hands <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> words: ‘We will surely perform our vows that we have made to burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.’ Go ahead, then, do what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have promised! Keep <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> vows!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Nevertheless, hear the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, all you people of Judah living in Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> great name, says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, that never again will any man of Judah living in the land of Egypt invoke <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name or say, ‘As surely as the Lord GOD lives.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and every man of Judah who is in the land of Egypt will meet his end by sword or famine, until they are finished off.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Those who escape the sword will return from Egypt to Judah, few in number, and the whole remnant of Judah who went to dwell in the land of Egypt will know whose word will stand, <span class='cap'>Mine</span><span class='nocap'>mine</span> or theirs!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>This will be a sign to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> that I will punish <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in this place, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may know that <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> threats of harm against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will surely stand.
<span class="reftext">30</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: Behold, I will deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who seek his life, just as I delivered Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who was seeking his life.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Lower Egypt</i> or <i class="calibre6">northern Egypt</i>; also in verse 15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Noph</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Upper Egypt</i> or <i class="calibre6">southern Egypt</i>; also in verse 15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the prophets, rising up early and sending (them),</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, in Lower and Upper Egypt; possibly <i class="calibre6">in the land of Egypt at Pathros</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
