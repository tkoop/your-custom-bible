<font >These are the LORD’s appointed feasts,
the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times.
The Passover to the LORD begins at twilight on the fourteenth day of
the first month. On the fifteenth day of the same month begins the
Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD. For seven days you must eat
unleavened bread. On the first day you are to hold a sacred assembly;
you are not to do any regular work. For seven days you are to present
an offering made by fire to the LORD. On the seventh day there shall
be a sacred assembly; you must not do any regular work.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
the Israelites and say, ‘When you enter the land that I am giving
you and you reap its harvest, you are to bring to the priest a sheaf
of the firstfruits of your harvest. And he shall wave the sheaf
before the LORD so that it may be accepted on your behalf; the priest
is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath. </font>

<font >On the day you wave the sheaf, you shall
offer a year-old lamb without blemish as a burnt offering to the
LORD, along with its grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine
flour mixed with oil—an offering made by fire to the LORD, a
pleasing aroma—and its drink offering of a quarter hin of wine. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You must not eat any bread or roasted or

God. This is to be a permanent statute for the generations to come,
wherever you live. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From the day after the Sabbath, the day
you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, you are to count off
seven full weeks. You shall count off fifty days until the day after
the seventh Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the
LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">

<font >Along with the bread you are to present
seven unblemished male lambs a year old, one young bull, and two
rams. They will be a burnt offering to the LORD, together with their
grain offerings and drink offerings—an offering made by fire, a
pleasing aroma to the LORD. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You shall also prepare one male goat as a
sin offering and two male lambs a year old as a peace offering. The
priest is to wave the lambs as a wave offering before the LORD,

lambs shall be holy to the LORD for the priest. </font>

anyone who does any work on this day. </font>

must not do any regular work. For seven days you are to present an
offering made by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day you are to hold
a sacred assembly and present an offering made by fire to the LORD.

the freewill offerings you give to the LORD. </font>

<font >On the fifteenth day of the seventh month,

the first day and also on the eighth day. </font>

<font >On the first day you are to gather the
fruit of majestic trees, the branches of palm trees, and the boughs
of leafy trees and of willows of the brook. And you are to rejoice
before the LORD your God for seven days. You are to celebrate this as
a feast to the LORD for seven days each year. This is a permanent

seventh month. </font>
