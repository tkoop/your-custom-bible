<font ><b>Esther Approaches the King</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the third day, Esther put on her royal
attire and stood in the inner court of the palace across from the
king’s quarters. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the
royal courtroom, facing the entrance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As soon as the king saw Queen Esther
standing in the court, she found favor in his sight. The king
extended the gold scepter in his hand toward Esther, and she
approached and touched the tip of the scepter. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What is it, Queen Esther?” the king
inquired. “What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it
will be given to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >If it pleases the king,” Esther
replied, “may the king and Haman come today to the banquet I have
prepared for the king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Hurry,” commanded the king, “and
bring Haman, so we can do as Esther has requested.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king and Haman went to the banquet
that Esther had prepared. And as they drank their wine, the king said
to Esther, “What is your petition? It will be given to you. What is
your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be fulfilled.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Esther replied, “This is my petition and
my request: If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it
pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, may the
king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them.
Then I will answer the king’s question.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That day Haman went out full of joy and
glad of heart. At the king’s gate, however, he saw Mordecai, who
did not rise or tremble in fear at his presence. And Haman was filled
with rage toward Mordecai. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and
went home. And calling for his friends and his wife Zeresh, Haman
recounted to them his glorious wealth, his many sons, and all the
ways the king had honored and promoted him over the other officials
and servants. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What is more,” Haman added, “Queen
Esther invited no one but me to join the king at the banquet she
prepared, and I am invited back tomorrow along with the king. Yet
none of this satisfies me as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting
at the king’s gate.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >His wife Zeresh and all his friends told
him, “Have them build a gallows fifty cubits high, and ask the king
in the morning to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go to the banquet
with the king and enjoy yourself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The advice pleased Haman, and he had the
gallows constructed. </font>
