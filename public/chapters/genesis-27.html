27</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Isaac Blesses Jacob</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Isaac was old and his eyes were so
weak that he could no longer see, he called his older son Esau and
said to him, “My son.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Here I am,” Esau replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Look,” said Isaac, “I am now old,
and I do not know the day of my death. Take your weapons—your
quiver and bow—and go out into the field to hunt some game for me.
Then prepare a tasty dish that I love and bring it to me to eat, so
that I may bless you before I die.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Rebekah was listening to what Isaac
told his son Esau. So when Esau went into the field to hunt game and
bring it back, Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Behold, I overheard
your father saying to your brother Esau, ‘Bring me some game and
prepare me a tasty dish to eat, so that I may bless you in the
presence of the LORD before I die.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now, my son, listen to my voice and do
exactly as I tell you. Go out to the flock and bring me two choice
young goats, so that I can make them into a tasty dish for your
father—the kind he loves. Then take it to your father to eat, so
that he may bless you before he dies.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, “Look,
my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I am smooth-skinned. What if my
father touches me? Then I would be revealed to him as a deceiver, and
I would bring upon myself a curse rather than a blessing.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">His mother replied, “Your curse be on
me, my son. Just obey my voice and go get them for me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jacob went and got two goats and
brought them to his mother, who made the tasty food his father loved.
And Rebekah took the finest clothes in the house that belonged to her
older son Esau, and she put them on her younger son Jacob. She also
put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part
of his neck. Then she handed her son Jacob the tasty food and bread
she had made. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jacob went to his father and said, “My
father.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Here I am!” he answered. “Which one
are you, my son?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau,
your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat
some of my game, so that you may bless me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Isaac asked his son, “How did you
ever find it so quickly, my son?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Because the LORD your God brought it to
me,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come
closer so I can touch you, my son. Are you really my son Esau, or
not?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jacob came close to his father Isaac,
who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the
hands are the hands of Esau.” Isaac did not recognize him, because
his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed
him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Again he asked, “Are you really my son
Esau?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And he replied, “I am.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Serve me,” said Isaac, “and let me
eat some of my son’s game, so that I may bless you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jacob brought it to him, and he ate; then
he brought him wine, and he drank. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please
come near and kiss me, my son.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So he came near and kissed him. When Isaac
smelled his clothing, he blessed him and said: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ah, the smell of my son </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">is like the smell of a field </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">that the LORD has blessed. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">May God give to you the dew of heaven </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">and the richness of the earth—</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">an abundance of grain and new wine. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">May peoples serve you </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">and nations bow down to you. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">May you be the master of your brothers, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">and may the sons of your mother bow down
to you. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">May those who curse you be cursed, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">and those who bless you be blessed.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As soon as Isaac had finished blessing him
and Jacob had left his father’s presence, his brother Esau returned
from the hunt. He too made some tasty food, brought it to his father,
and said to him, “My father, sit up and eat of your son’s game,
so that you may bless me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But his father Isaac replied, “Who are
you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am Esau, your firstborn son,” he
answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Isaac began to tremble violently and said,
“Who was it, then, who hunted the game and brought it to me? Before
you came in, I ate it all and blessed him—and indeed, he will be
blessed!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Esau heard his father’s words, he
let out a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me
too, O my father!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Isaac replied, “Your brother came
deceitfully and took your blessing.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Esau declared, “Is he not rightly
named Jacob? For he has cheated me twice. He took my birthright, and
now he has taken my blessing.” Then he asked, “Haven’t you
saved a blessing for me?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Isaac answered Esau: “Look, I have
made him your master and given him all his relatives as servants; I
have sustained him with grain and new wine. What is left that I can
do for you, my son?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Esau said to his father, “Do you have
only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, O my father!” Then Esau
wept aloud. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">His father Isaac answered him: </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Behold, your dwelling place shall be </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">away from the richness of the land, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">away from the dew of heaven above. </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You shall live by the sword </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">and serve your brother. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when you rebel, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">you will tear his yoke from your neck.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Esau held a grudge against Jacob because
of the blessing his father had given him. And Esau said in his heart,
“The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill
my brother Jacob.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the words of her older son Esau were
relayed to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and told him,
“Look, your brother Esau is consoling himself by plotting to kill
you. So now, my son, obey my voice and flee at once to my brother
Laban in Haran. Stay with him for a while, until your brother’s
fury subsides— until your brother’s rage against you wanes and he
forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send for you and bring
you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary
of my life because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a Hittite
wife from among them, what good is my life?” </font>
