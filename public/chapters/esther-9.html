<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Feast of Purim Instituted</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month, the month of Adar, the king’s command and edict were to be
executed. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower
them, but their plan was overturned and the Jews overpowered those
who hated them. In each of the provinces of King Xerxes, the Jews
assembled in their cities to attack those who sought to harm them. No
man could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen upon
all peoples. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And all the officials of the provinces,
the satraps, the governors, and the king’s administrators helped
the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen upon them. For
Mordecai exercised great power in the palace, and his fame spread
throughout the provinces as he became more and more powerful. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Jews put all their enemies to the
sword, killing and destroying them, and they did as they pleased to
those who hated them. In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and
destroyed five hundred men, including Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha.
They killed these ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of
the Jews, but they did not lay a hand on the plunder. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On that day the number of those killed in
the citadel of Susa was reported to the king, who said to Queen
Esther, “In the citadel of Susa the Jews have killed and destroyed
five hundred men, including Haman’s ten sons. What have they done
in the rest of the royal provinces? Now what is your petition? It
will be given to you. And what further do you request? It will be
fulfilled.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Esther replied, “If it pleases the king,
may the Jews in Susa also have tomorrow to carry out today’s edict,
and may the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king commanded that this be done.
An edict was issued in Susa, and they hanged the ten sons of Haman.
On the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, the Jews in Susa came
together again and put to death three hundred men there, but they did
not lay a hand on the plunder. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The rest of the Jews in the royal
provinces also assembled to defend themselves and rid themselves of
their enemies. They killed 75,000 who hated them, but they did not
lay a hand on the plunder. This was done on the thirteenth day of the
month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested, making it a day
of feasting and joy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled
on the thirteenth and the fourteenth days of the month. So they
rested on the fifteenth day, making it a day of feasting and joy.
This is why the rural Jews, who live in the villages, observe the
fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting. It
is a holiday for sending gifts to one another. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Mordecai recorded these events and sent
letters to all the Jews in all the provinces of King Xerxes, both
near and far, to establish among them an annual celebration on the
fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar as the days on
which the Jews gained rest from their enemies and the month in which
their sorrow turned to joy and their mourning into a holiday. He
wrote that these were to be days of feasting and joy, of sending
gifts to one another and to the poor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the Jews agreed to continue the custom
they had started, as Mordecai had written to them. For Haman son of
Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted
against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the Pur (that is, the
lot) to crush and destroy them. But when it came before the king, he
commanded by letter that the wicked scheme which Haman had devised
against the Jews should come back upon his own head, and that he and
his sons should be hanged on the gallows. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore these days are called Purim,
from the word Pur. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Because of all the instructions in this
letter, and because of all they had seen and experienced, the Jews
bound themselves to establish the custom that they and their
descendants and all who join them should not fail to celebrate these
two days at the appointed time each and every year, according to
their regulation. These days should be remembered and celebrated by
every generation, family, province, and city, so that these days of
Purim should not fail to be observed among the Jews, nor should the
memory of them fade from their descendants. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Queen Esther daughter of Abihail, along
with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this
second letter concerning Purim. And Mordecai sent letters with words
of peace and truth to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of the
kingdom of Xerxes, in order to confirm these days of Purim at their
appointed time, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had
established them and had committed themselves and their descendants
to the times of fasting and lamentation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Esther’s decree confirmed these
regulations about Purim, which were written into the record. </font>
