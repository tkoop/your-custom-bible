<span class="reftext">2</span>But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>With the help of Eleazar’s descendant Zadok and Ithamar’s descendant Ahimelech, David divided them according to the offices of their service.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Since more leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than those of Ithamar, they were divided accordingly. There were sixteen heads of families from the descendants of Eleazar and eight from the descendants of Ithamar.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Thus they were divided by lot, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s descendants.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>The scribe, Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officers: Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites—one family being taken from Eleazar, and then one from Ithamar.
