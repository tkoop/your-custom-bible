<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the third year of the reign of
Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to
Jerusalem and besieged it. And the Lord delivered into his hand
Jehoiakim king of Judah, along with some of the articles from the
house of God. He carried these off to the land of Shinar, to the
house of his god, where he put them in the treasury of his god. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, the chief
of his court officials, to bring in some Israelites from the royal
family and the nobility— young men without blemish, handsome,
gifted in all wisdom, knowledgeable, quick to understand, and
qualified to serve in the king’s palace—and to teach them the
language and literature of the Chaldeans. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king assigned them daily provisions of
the royal food and wine. They were to be trained for three years,
after which they were to enter the king’s service. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Among these young men were some from
Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. The chief official
gave them new names: To Daniel he gave the name Belteshazzar; to
Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Daniel made up his mind that he would
not defile himself with the king’s food or wine. So he asked the
chief official for permission not to defile himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now God had granted Daniel favor and
compassion from the chief official, but he said to Daniel, “I fear
my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. For why
should he see your faces looking thinner than those of the other
young men your age? You would endanger my head before the king!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Daniel said to the steward whom the
chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and
Azariah, “Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given
only vegetables to eat and water to drink. Then compare our
appearances with those of the young men who are eating the royal
food, and deal with your servants according to what you see.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So he consented to this and tested them
for ten days. And at the end of ten days, they looked healthier and
better nourished than all the young men who were eating the king’s
food. So the steward continued to withhold their choice food and the
wine they were to drink, and he gave them vegetables instead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">To these four young men God gave knowledge
and understanding in every kind of literature and wisdom. And Daniel
had insight into all kinds of visions and dreams. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now at the end of the time specified by
the king, the chief official presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. And
the king spoke with them, and among all the young men he found no one
equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they entered the
king’s service. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In every matter of wisdom and
understanding about which the king consulted them, he found them ten
times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire
kingdom. And Daniel remained there until the first year of King
Cyrus. </font>
