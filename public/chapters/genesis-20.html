<font ><b>Abraham, Sarah, and Abimelech</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Abraham journeyed from there to the
region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was
staying in Gerar, Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my
sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar had Sarah brought to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One night, however, God came to Abimelech
in a dream and told him, “You are as good as dead because of the
woman you have taken, for she is a married woman.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he
replied, “Lord, would You destroy a nation even though it is
innocent? Didn’t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And she
herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the
integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then God said to Abimelech in the dream,
“Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience, and so I
have kept you from sinning against Me. That is why I did not let you
touch her. Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet; he will
pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, be
aware that you will surely die—you and all who belong to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Early the next morning Abimelech got up
and summoned all his servants; and when he described to them all that
had happened, the men were terrified. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked,
“What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you
have brought such tremendous guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have
done things to me that should not be done.” Abimelech also asked
Abraham, “What prompted you to do such a thing?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Abraham replied, “I thought to myself,
‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place. They will kill me on
account of my wife.’ Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter
of my father—though not the daughter of my mother—and she became
my wife. So when God had me journey from my father’s house, I said
to Sarah, ‘This is how you can show your loyalty to me: Wherever we
go, say of me, “He is my brother.”<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Abimelech brought sheep and cattle,
menservants and maidservants, and he gave them to Abraham and
restored his wife Sarah to him. And Abimelech said, “Look, my land
is before you. Settle wherever you please.” And he said to Sarah,
“See, I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is
your vindication before all who are with you; you are completely
cleared.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed
Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, so that they could again
bear children— for on account of Abraham’s wife Sarah, the LORD
had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech’s household. </font>
