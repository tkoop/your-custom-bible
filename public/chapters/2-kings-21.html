His mother’s name was Hephzibah.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And he did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> by following the abominations of the nations that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had driven out before the Israelites.
<span class="reftext">3</span>For he rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed, and he raised up altars for Baal. He made an Asherah pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, and he worshiped and served all the host of heaven.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Manasseh also built altars in the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, of which <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had said, “In Jerusalem I will put <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Name</span><span class='nocap'>name</span>.”
<span class="reftext">5</span>In both courtyards of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, he built altars to all the host of heaven.
<span class="reftext">6</span>He sacrificed his own son in the fire,<span class="fn">a</span>  <span class='spell ca'>practised</span><span class='spell gb'>practised</span><span class='spell us'>practiced</span> sorcery and divination, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did great evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, provoking <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> to anger.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Manasseh even took the carved Asherah pole he had made and set it up in the temple, of which <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had said to David and his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will establish <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Name</span><span class='nocap'>name</span> forever.
<span class="reftext">8</span>I will never again cause the feet of the Israelites to wander from the land that I gave to their fathers, if only they are careful to do all I have commanded them—the whole <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> that <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> servant Moses commanded them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>But the people did not listen and Manasseh led them astray, so that they did greater evil than the nations that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had destroyed before the Israelites.
</p><p class="hdg">Manasseh’s Idolatries Rebuked<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 33:10–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> spoke through <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> servants the prophets, saying,
<span class="reftext">11</span>“Since Manasseh king of Judah has committed all these abominations, acting more wickedly than the Amorites who preceded him, and with his idols has caused Judah to sin,
<span class="reftext">12</span>this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I am bringing such calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah that the news will reverberate in the ears of all who hear it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab, and I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes out a bowl—wiping it and turning it upside down.
<span class="reftext">14</span>So I will forsake the remnant of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> inheritance and deliver them into the hands of their enemies. And they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies,
<span class="reftext">15</span>because they have done evil in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sight and have provoked <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to anger from the day their fathers came out of Egypt until this day.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Moreover, Manasseh shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end, in addition to the sin that he had caused Judah to commit, doing evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>As for the rest of the acts of Manasseh, along with all his accomplishments and the sin that he committed, are they not written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza. And his son Amon reigned in his place.

His mother’s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; she was from Jotbah.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And he did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, as his father Manasseh had done.
<span class="reftext">21</span>He walked in all the ways of his father, and he served and worshiped the idols his father had served.
