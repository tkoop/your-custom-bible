<font ><b>Manasseh’s Idolatries Rebuked</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Manasseh was twelve years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. His
mother’s name was Hephzibah. And he did evil in the sight of the
LORD by following the abominations of the nations that the LORD had
driven out before the Israelites. For he rebuilt the high places that
his father Hezekiah had destroyed, and he raised up altars for Baal.
He made an Asherah pole, as King Ahab of Israel had done, and he
worshiped and served all the host of heaven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Manasseh also built altars in the house of
the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “In Jerusalem I will put My
Name.” In both courtyards of the house of the LORD, he built altars
to all the host of heaven. He sacrificed his own son in the fire,
practiced sorcery and divination, and consulted mediums and
spiritists. He did great evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him
to anger. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Manasseh even took the carved Asherah pole
he had made and set it up in the temple, of which the LORD had said
to David and his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem,
which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will establish
My Name forever. I will never again cause the feet of the Israelites
to wander from the land that I gave to their fathers, if only they
are careful to do all I have commanded them—the whole Law that My
servant Moses commanded them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the people did not listen and Manasseh
led them astray, so that they did greater evil than the nations that
the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD spoke through His servants
the prophets, saying, “Since Manasseh king of Judah has committed
all these abominations, acting more wickedly than the Amorites who
preceded him, and with his idols has caused Judah to sin, this is
what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I am bringing such
calamity upon Jerusalem and Judah that the news will reverberate in
the ears of all who hear it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I will stretch out over Jerusalem the
measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against
the house of Ahab, and I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes out a
bowl—wiping it and turning it upside down. So I will forsake the
remnant of My inheritance and deliver them into the hands of their
enemies. And they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies,
because they have done evil in My sight and have provoked Me to anger
from the day their fathers came out of Egypt until this day.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, Manasseh shed so much innocent
blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end, in addition to the
sin that he had caused Judah to commit, doing evil in the sight of
the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Manasseh,
along with all his accomplishments and the sin that he committed, are
they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Manasseh rested with his fathers and
was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza. And his son Amon
reigned in his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Amon was twenty-two years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mother’s
name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; she was from Jotbah. And he
did evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done.
He walked in all the ways of his father, and he served and worshiped
the idols his father had served. He abandoned the LORD, the God of
his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the servants of Amon conspired
against him and killed the king in his palace. But the people of the
land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they
made his son Josiah king in his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Amon, along
with his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the
Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And he was buried in his tomb in
the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah reigned in his place. </font>
