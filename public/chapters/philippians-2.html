<span class="reftext">13</span>For it is God who works in <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to will and to act on behalf of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> good purpose.

<span class="reftext">22</span>But <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> know Timothy’s proven worth, that as a child with his father he has served with me to advance the gospel.
<span class="reftext">23</span>So I hope to send him as soon as I see what happens with me.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And I trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>But I thought it necessary to send back to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> messenger and minister to my needs.
<span class="reftext">26</span>For he has been longing for all of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and is distressed because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> heard he was ill.

<span class="reftext">29</span>Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> men like him,
