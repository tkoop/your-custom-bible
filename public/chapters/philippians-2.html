<font >Therefore if you have any encouragement in
Christ, if any comfort from His love, if any fellowship with the
Spirit, if any affection and compassion, then make my joy complete by
being like-minded, having the same love, being united in spirit and
purpose. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do nothing out of selfish ambition or
empty pride, but in humility consider others more important than
yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests,
but also to the interests of others. </font>

<font >Who, existing in the form of God, </font>

<font >did not consider equality with God </font>

<font >something to be grasped, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >taking the form of a servant, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He humbled Himself </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Therefore God exalted Him to the highest
place </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and gave Him the name above all names, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >that at the name of Jesus every knee
should bow, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ
is Lord, </font>

<font >to the glory of God the Father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, my beloved, just as you have
always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now even more in my
absence, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
For it is God who works in you to will and to act on behalf of His
good purpose. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do everything without complaining or
arguing, so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God
without fault in a crooked and perverse generation, in which you
shine as lights in the world as you hold forth the word of life, in
order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or
labor in vain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But even if I am being poured out like a
drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad
and rejoice with all of you. So you too should be glad and rejoice
with me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send
Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I learn how you
are doing. I have nobody else like him who will genuinely care for
your needs. For all the others look after their own interests, not
those of Jesus Christ. But you know Timothy’s proven worth, that as
a child with his father he has served with me to advance the gospel.
So I hope to send him as soon as I see what happens with me. And I
trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But I thought it necessary to send back to
you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who
is also your messenger and minister to my needs. For he has been
longing for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was
ill. He was sick indeed, nearly unto death. But God had mercy on him,
and not only on him but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore I am all the more eager to send
him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be
less anxious. Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor men
like him, because he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his
life to make up for your deficit of service to me. </font>
