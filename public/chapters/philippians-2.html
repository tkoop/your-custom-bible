<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">One in Christ<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Ephesians 2:11–18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore if you have any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort from His love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,
<span class="reftext">2</span>then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being united in spirit and purpose.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty pride, but in humility consider others more important than yourselves.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.
</p><p class="hdg">The Mind of Christ<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 52:13–15)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Who, existing in the form of God, </p><p class="indent"> did not consider equality with God </p><p class="indent"> something to be grasped,<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>but emptied Himself, </p><p class="indent"> taking the form of a servant, </p><p class="indent"> being made in human likeness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And being found in appearance as a man, </p><p class="indent"> He humbled Himself </p><p class="indent1"> and became obedient to death—</p><p class="indent"> even death on a cross.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place </p><p class="indent"> and gave Him the name above all names,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, </p><p class="indent"> in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, </p><p class="indent"> to the glory of God the Father.
</p><p class="hdg">Lights in the World<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 5:13–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For it is God who works in you to will and to act on behalf of His good purpose.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Do everything without complaining or arguing,
<span class="reftext">15</span>so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and perverse generation,<span class="fn">b</span>  in which you shine as lights in the world
<span class="reftext">16</span>as you hold forth the word of life, in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> in vain.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.
<span class="reftext">18</span>So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.
</p><p class="hdg">Timothy and Epaphroditus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Corinthians 16:10–12)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I learn how you are doing.
<span class="reftext">20</span>I have nobody else like him who will genuinely care for your needs.
<span class="reftext">21</span>For all the others look after their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But you know Timothy’s proven worth, that as a child with his father he has served with me to advance the gospel.
<span class="reftext">23</span>So I hope to send him as soon as I see what happens with me.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And I trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>But I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my needs.
<span class="reftext">26</span>For he has been longing for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.
<span class="reftext">27</span>He was sick indeed, nearly unto death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> men like him,
<span class="reftext">30</span>because he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for your deficit of service to me.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">something to be exploited</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Deuteronomy 32:5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
