<font ><b>Jeremiah’s Letter to the Exiles</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the text of the letter that
Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders
among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets, and all the others
Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
(This was after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the court officials,
the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the
metalsmiths had been exiled from Jerusalem.) The letter was entrusted
to Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah
king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It stated: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of
Israel, says to all the exiles who were carried away from Jerusalem
to Babylon: “Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat
their produce. Take wives and have sons and daughters. Take wives for
your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may
have sons and daughters. Multiply there; do not decrease. Seek the
prosperity of the city to which I have sent you as exiles. Pray to
the LORD on its behalf, for if it prospers, you too will prosper.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the
God of Israel, says: “Do not be deceived by the prophets and
diviners among you, and do not listen to the dreams you elicit from
them. For they are falsely prophesying to you in My name; I have not
sent them, declares the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this is what the LORD says: “When
Babylon’s seventy years are complete, I will attend to you and
confirm My promise to restore you to this place. For I know the plans
I have for you, declares the LORD, plans to prosper you and not to
harm you, to give you a future and a hope. Then you will call upon Me
and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. You will seek Me
and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart. I will be
found by you, declares the LORD, and I will restore you from
captivity and gather you from all the nations and places to which I
have banished you, declares the LORD. I will restore you to the place
from which I sent you into exile.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because you may say, “The LORD has
raised up for us prophets in Babylon,” this is what the LORD says
about the king who sits on David’s throne and all the people who
remain in this city, your brothers who did not go with you into
exile— this is what the LORD of Hosts says: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I will send against them sword and
famine and plague, and I will make them like rotten figs, so bad they
cannot be eaten. I will pursue them with sword and famine and plague.
I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth—a curse,
a desolation, and an object of scorn and reproach among all the
nations to which I banish them. I will do this because they have not
listened to My words, declares the LORD, which I sent to them again
and again through My servants the prophets. And neither have you
exiles listened, declares the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So hear the word of the LORD, all you
exiles I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. This is what the
LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and
Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you lies in My name:
“I will deliver them to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will
kill them before your very eyes. Because of them, all the exiles of
Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: ‘May the LORD make
you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the
fire!’ For they have committed an outrage in Israel by committing
adultery with the wives of their neighbors and speaking lies in My
name, which I did not command them to do. I am He who knows, and I am
a witness, declares the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are to tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite
that this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “In
your own name you have sent out letters to all the people of
Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the
priests. You said to Zephaniah: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
‘<font >The LORD has appointed you priest in
place of Jehoiada, to be the chief officer in the house of the LORD,
responsible for any madman who acts like a prophet—you must put him
in stocks and neck irons. So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah
of Anathoth, who poses as a prophet among you? For he has sent to us
in Babylon, claiming: Since the exile will be lengthy, build houses
and settle down; plant gardens and eat their produce.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >(Zephaniah the priest, however, had read
this letter to Jeremiah the prophet.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the word of the LORD came to
Jeremiah: “Send a message telling all the exiles what the LORD says
concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite. Because Shemaiah has prophesied
to you—though I did not send him—and has made you trust in a lie,
this is what the LORD says: ‘I will surely punish Shemaiah the
Nehelamite and his descendants. He will have no one left among this
people, nor will he see the good that I will bring to My people,
declares the LORD, for he has preached rebellion against the LORD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
