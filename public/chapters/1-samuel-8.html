<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Samuel grew old, he appointed his
sons as judges over Israel. The name of his firstborn son was Joel,
and the name of his second was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.
But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside toward
dishonest gain, accepting bribes and perverting justice. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So all the elders of Israel gathered
together and came to Samuel at Ramah. “Look,” they said, “you
are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint a king
to judge us like all the other nations.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when they said, “Give us a king to
judge us,” their demand was displeasing in the sight of Samuel; so
he prayed to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to
the voice of the people in all that they say to you. For it is not
you they have rejected, but they have rejected Me as their king. Just
as they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until
this day, forsaking Me and serving other gods, so they are doing to
you. Now listen to them, but you must solemnly warn them and show
them the manner of the king who will reign over them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Samuel spoke all the words of the LORD
to the people who were asking him for a king. He said, “This will
be the manner of the king who will reign over you: He will take your
sons and appoint them to his own chariots and horses, to run in front
of his chariots. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He will appoint some for himself as
commanders of thousands and of fifties, and others to plow his
ground, to reap his harvest, to make his weapons of war, and to equip
his chariots. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And he will take your daughters to be
perfumers, cooks, and bakers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He will take the best of your fields and
vineyards and olive groves and give them to his servants. He will
take a tenth of your grain and grape harvest and give it to his
officials and servants. And he will take your menservants and
maidservants and your best cattle and donkeys and put them to his own
use. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He will take a tenth of your flocks, and
you yourselves will become his slaves. When that day comes, you will
beg for relief from the king you have chosen, but the LORD will not
answer you on that day.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nevertheless, the people refused to listen
to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We must have a king over us. Then
we will be like all the other nations, with a king to judge us, to go
out before us, and to fight our battles.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Samuel listened to all the words of the
people and repeated them in the hearing of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Listen to their voice,” the LORD said
to Samuel. “Appoint a king for them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Samuel told the men of Israel,
“Everyone must go back to his city.” </font>
