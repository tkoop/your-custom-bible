<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Boaz Redeems Ruth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Meanwhile, Boaz went to the gate and sat down there. Soon the kinsman-redeemer<span class="fn">a</span>  of whom he had spoken came along, and Boaz said, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.” So he went over and sat down.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Then Boaz took ten of the elders of the city and said, “Sit here,” and they did so.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And he said to the kinsman-redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
<span class="reftext">4</span>I thought I should inform you that you may buy it back in the presence of those seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you want to redeem it, do so. But if you<span class="fn">b</span>  will not redeem it, tell me so I may know, because there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you.” </p><p class="reg1">“I will redeem it,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the land from Naomi and also from Ruth the Moabitess, you must also acquire the widow of the deceased in order to raise up the name of the deceased on his inheritance.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>The kinsman-redeemer replied, “I cannot redeem it myself, or I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I cannot redeem it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now in former times in Israel, concerning the redemption or exchange of property, to make any matter legally binding a man would remove his sandal and give it to the other party, and this was a confirmation in Israel.
<span class="reftext">8</span>So the kinsman-redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>At this, Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Moreover, I have acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, to raise up the name of the deceased through his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his brothers or from the gate of his home. You are witnesses today.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>“We are witnesses,” said the elders and all the people at the gate. “May the LORD make the woman entering your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you be prosperous in Ephrathah and famous in Bethlehem.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And may your house become like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring the LORD will give you by this young woman.”
</p><p class="hdg">Boaz Marries Ruth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And when he had relations with her, the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a kinsman-redeemer. May his name become famous in Israel.
<span class="reftext">15</span>He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And Naomi took the child, placed him on her lap, and became a nurse to him.
<span class="reftext">17</span>The neighbour women said, “A son has been born to Naomi,” and they named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, the father of David.
