<font ><b>Boaz Redeems Ruth</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, Boaz went to the gate and sat
down there. Soon the kinsman-redeemer of whom he had spoken came
along, and Boaz said, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.”
So he went over and sat down. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Boaz took ten of the elders of the
city and said, “Sit here,” and they did so. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And he said to the kinsman-redeemer,
“Naomi, who has returned from the land of Moab, is selling the
piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech. I thought I
should inform you that you may buy it back in the presence of those
seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you
want to redeem it, do so. But if you will not redeem it, tell me so I
may know, because there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next
after you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I will redeem it,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the
land from Naomi and also from Ruth the Moabitess, you must also
acquire the widow of the deceased in order to raise up the name of
the deceased on his inheritance.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The kinsman-redeemer replied, “I cannot
redeem it myself, or I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Take my
right of redemption, because I cannot redeem it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now in former times in Israel, concerning
the redemption or exchange of property, to make any matter legally
binding a man would remove his sandal and give it to the other party,
and this was a confirmation in Israel. So the kinsman-redeemer
removed his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, Boaz said to the elders and all
the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi
all that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon. Moreover, I have
acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, to raise
up the name of the deceased through his inheritance, so that his name
will not disappear from among his brothers or from the gate of his
home. You are witnesses today.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >We are witnesses,” said the elders
and all the people at the gate. “May the LORD make the woman
entering your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the
house of Israel. May you be prosperous in Ephrathah and famous in
Bethlehem. And may your house become like the house of Perez, whom
Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring the LORD will give you
by this young woman.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his
wife. And when he had relations with her, the LORD enabled her to
conceive, and she gave birth to a son. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed
be the LORD, who has not left you this day without a
kinsman-redeemer. May his name become famous in Israel. He will renew
your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law,
who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given him
birth.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Naomi took the child, placed him on
her lap, and became a nurse to him. The neighbor women said, “A son
has been born to Naomi,” and they named him Obed. He became the
father of Jesse, the father of David. </font>
</p>
