<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jonathan Helps David</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my iniquity? How have I sinned against your father, that he wants to take my life?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Far from it!” Jonathan replied. “You will not die. Indeed, my father does nothing, great or small, without telling me. So why would he hide this matter from me? This cannot be true!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But David again vowed, “Your father knows very well that I have found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in your eyes, and he has said, ‘Jonathan must not know of this, or he will be grieved.’ As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives and as you yourself live, there is but a step between me and death.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you desire, I will do for you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So David told him, “Look, tomorrow is the <span class='cap'>New</span><span class='nocap'>new</span> <span class='cap'>Moon</span><span class='nocap'>moon</span>,<span class="fn">a</span>  and I am supposed to dine with the king. Instead, let me go and hide in the field until the third evening from now.
<span class="reftext">6</span>If your father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David urgently requested my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because there is an annual sacrifice for his whole clan.’
<span class="reftext">7</span>If he says, ‘Good,’ then your servant is safe, but if he is enraged, you will know he has evil intentions.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore deal faithfully with your servant, for you have brought me into a covenant with you before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. If there is iniquity in me, then kill me yourself; why should you bring me to your father?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“Never!” Jonathan replied. “If I ever found out that my father had evil intentions against you, would I not tell you?”
</p><p class="hdg">Jonathan and David Renew Their Covenant</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then David asked Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>“Come,” he replied, “let us go out to the field.” </p><p class="reg1"> So the two of them went out into the field,
<span class="reftext">12</span>and Jonathan said, “By <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, I will sound out my father by this time tomorrow or the next day. If he is <span class='spell ca'>favourable</span><span class='spell gb'>favourable</span><span class='spell us'>favorable</span> toward you, will I not send for you and tell you?
<span class="reftext">13</span>But if my father intends to bring evil on you, then may <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> punish me, and ever so severely, if I do not tell you and send you on your way in safety. May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> be with you, just as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has been with my father.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And as long as I live, treat me with <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s loving devotion,<span class="fn">b</span>  that I may not die,
<span class="reftext">15</span>and do not ever cut off your loving devotion from my household—not even when <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> cuts off every one of David’s enemies from the face of the earth.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> hold David’s enemies accountable.”
<span class="reftext">17</span>And Jonathan had David reaffirm his vow out of love for him, for Jonathan loved David as he loved himself.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the <span class='cap'>New</span><span class='nocap'>new</span> <span class='cap'>Moon</span><span class='nocap'>moon</span>, and you will be missed if your seat is empty.
<span class="reftext">19</span>When you have stayed three days, hurry down to the place you hid on the day this trouble began, and remain beside the stone Ezel.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">20</span>I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as if I were aiming at a target.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows!’ Now, if I expressly say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them,’ then come, because as surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But if I say to the young man, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has sent you away.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And as for the matter you and I have discussed, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is a witness between you and me forever.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So David hid in the field, and when the <span class='cap'>New</span><span class='nocap'>new</span> <span class='cap'>Moon</span><span class='nocap'>moon</span> had come, the king sat down to eat.
<span class="reftext">25</span>He sat in his usual place by the wall, opposite Jonathan and beside Abner,<span class="fn">d</span>  but David’s place was empty.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Saul said nothing that day because he thought, “Something has happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean—surely he is unclean.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>But on the day after the <span class='cap'>New</span><span class='nocap'>new</span> <span class='cap'>Moon</span><span class='nocap'>moon</span>, the second day, David’s place was still empty, and Saul asked his son Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal either yesterday or today?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Jonathan answered, “David urgently requested my permission to go to Bethlehem,
<span class="reftext">29</span>saying, ‘Please let me go, because our clan is holding a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has told me to be there. So now, if I have found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in your eyes, please let me go and see my brothers.’ That is why he did not come to the king’s table.”
</p><p class="hdg">Saul Seeks to Kill Jonathan</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the disgrace of the mother who bore you?
<span class="reftext">31</span>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingship shall be established. Now send for him and bring him to me, for he must surely die!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>“Why must he be put to death?” Jonathan replied. “What has he done?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan to kill him; so Jonathan knew that his father was determined to kill David.
<span class="reftext">34</span>Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger and did not eat any food that second day of the month, for he was grieved by his father’s shameful treatment of David.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the appointment with David, and a small boy was with him.
<span class="reftext">36</span>He said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” And as the boy ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>When the boy reached the place where Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called to him, “Isn’t the arrow beyond you?”
<span class="reftext">38</span>Then Jonathan cried out, “Hurry! Make haste! Do not delay!” So the boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>But the boy did not know anything; only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement.
<span class="reftext">40</span>Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the boy and said, “Go, take it back to the city.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>When the young man had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone,<span class="fn">e</span>  fell facedown, and bowed three times. Then he and Jonathan kissed each other and wept together—though David wept more.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>And Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, for the two of us have sworn in the name of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, saying, ‘May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> be a witness between you and me, and between your descendants and mine forever.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” Then David got up and departed, and Jonathan went back into the city.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the New Moon feast; also in verses 18, 24, and 27<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">chesed</i> are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as <i class="calibre6">loving devotion</i>; the range of meaning includes <i class="calibre6">love</i>, <i class="calibre6">goodness</i>, <i class="calibre6">kindness</i>, <i class="calibre6">faithfulness</i>, and <i class="calibre6">mercy</i>, as well as <i class="calibre6">loyalty to a covenant</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Ezel</i> means <i class="calibre6">departure</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">by the wall.
