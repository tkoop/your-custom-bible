<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He
came to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my iniquity?
How have I sinned against your father, that he wants to take my
life?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Far from it!” Jonathan replied. “You
will not die. Indeed, my father does nothing, great or small, without
telling me. So why would he hide this matter from me? This cannot be
true!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But David again vowed, “Your father
knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has
said, ‘Jonathan must not know of this, or he will be grieved.’ As
surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, there is but a
step between me and death.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever
you desire, I will do for you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David told him, “Look, tomorrow is
the New Moon, and I am supposed to dine with the king. Instead, let
me go and hide in the field until the third evening from now. If your
father misses me at all, tell him, ‘David urgently requested my
permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because there is an
annual sacrifice for his whole clan.’ If he says, ‘Good,’ then
your servant is safe, but if he is enraged, you will know he has evil
intentions. Therefore deal faithfully with your servant, for you have
brought me into a covenant with you before the LORD. If there is
iniquity in me, then kill me yourself; why should you bring me to
your father?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Never!” Jonathan replied. “If I
ever found out that my father had evil intentions against you, would
I not tell you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David asked Jonathan, “Who will
tell me if your father answers you harshly?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Come,” he replied, “let us go out
to the field.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the two of them went out into the
field, and Jonathan said, “By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will
sound out my father by this time tomorrow or the next day. If he is
favorable toward you, will I not send for you and tell you? But if my
father intends to bring evil on you, then may the LORD punish me, and
ever so severely, if I do not tell you and send you on your way in
safety. May the LORD be with you, just as He has been with my father.
And as long as I live, treat me with the LORD’s loving devotion,
that I may not die, and do not ever cut off your loving devotion from
my household—not even when the LORD cuts off every one of David’s
enemies from the face of the earth.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jonathan made a covenant with the house
of David, saying, “May the LORD hold David’s enemies
accountable.” And Jonathan had David reaffirm his vow out of love
for him, for Jonathan loved David as he loved himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow
is the New Moon, and you will be missed if your seat is empty. When
you have stayed three days, hurry down to the place you hid on the
day this trouble began, and remain beside the stone Ezel. I will
shoot three arrows to the side of it, as if I were aiming at a
target. Then I will send a boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows!’
Now, if I expressly say to him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side
of you; bring them,’ then come, because as surely as the LORD
lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger. But if I say to the
young man, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then you must go,
for the LORD has sent you away. And as for the matter you and I have
discussed, the LORD is a witness between you and me forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David hid in the field, and when the
New Moon had come, the king sat down to eat. He sat in his usual
place by the wall, opposite Jonathan and beside Abner, but David’s
place was empty. Saul said nothing that day because he thought,
“Something has happened to David to make him ceremonially
unclean—surely he is unclean.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But on the day after the New Moon, the
second day, David’s place was still empty, and Saul asked his son
Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the meal either
yesterday or today?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jonathan answered, “David urgently
requested my permission to go to Bethlehem, saying, ‘Please let me
go, because our clan is holding a sacrifice in the city, and my
brother has told me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in
your eyes, please let me go and see my brothers.’ That is why he
did not come to the king’s table.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Saul’s anger burned against
Jonathan, and he said to him, “You son of a perverse and rebellious
woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your
own shame and to the disgrace of the mother who bore you? For as long
as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your
kingship shall be established. Now send for him and bring him to me,
for he must surely die!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Why must he be put to death?”
Jonathan replied. “What has he done?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan to
kill him; so Jonathan knew that his father was determined to kill
David. Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger and did not eat
any food that second day of the month, for he was grieved by his
father’s shameful treatment of David. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the morning Jonathan went out to the
field for the appointment with David, and a small boy was with him.
He said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” And as the
boy ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the boy reached the place where
Jonathan’s arrow had fallen, Jonathan called to him, “Isn’t the
arrow beyond you?” Then Jonathan cried out, “Hurry! Make haste!
Do not delay!” So the boy picked up the arrow and returned to his
master. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the boy did not know anything; only
Jonathan and David knew the arrangement. Then Jonathan gave his
equipment to the boy and said, “Go, take it back to the city.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the young man had gone, David got up
from the south side of the stone, fell facedown, and bowed three
times. Then he and Jonathan kissed each other and wept
together—though David wept more. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Jonathan said to David, “Go in
peace, for the two of us have sworn in the name of the LORD, saying,
‘May the LORD be a witness between you and me, and between your
descendants and mine forever.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
Then David got up and departed, and Jonathan went back into the city.
