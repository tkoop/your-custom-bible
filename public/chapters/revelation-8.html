<font ><b>The Seventh Seal and First Four
trumpets</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Lamb opened the seventh seal,
there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. And I saw the
seven angels who stand before God, and they were given seven
trumpets. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then another angel, who had a golden
censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to
offer, along with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar
before the throne. And the smoke of the incense, together with the
prayers of the saints, rose up before God from the hand of the angel.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the angel took the censer, filled it
with fire from the altar, and hurled it to the earth; and there were
peals of thunder, and rumblings, and flashes of lightning, and an
earthquake. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the seven angels with the seven
trumpets prepared to sound them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the first angel sounded his trumpet,
and hail and fire mixed with blood were hurled down upon the earth. A
third of the earth was burned up, along with a third of the trees and
all the green grass. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the second angel sounded his trumpet,
and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into
the sea. A third of the sea turned to blood, a third of the living
creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the third angel sounded his trumpet,
and a great star burning like a torch fell from heaven and landed on
a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name of the
star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood
oil, and many people died from the bitter waters. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the fourth angel sounded his trumpet,
and a third of the sun and moon and stars were struck. A third of the
stars were darkened, a third of the day was without light, and a
third of the night as well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And as I observed, I heard an eagle flying
overhead, calling in a loud voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe to those who
dwell on the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded
by the remaining three angels!” </font>
