<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Seventh Seal</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and they were given seven trumpets.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, along with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar before the throne.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, rose up before God from the hand of the angel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it to the earth; and there were peals of thunder, and rumblings, and flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
</p><p class="hdg">The First Four Trumpets</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>And the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then the first angel sounded his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were hurled down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, along with a third of the trees and all the green grass.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned to blood,
<span class="reftext">9</span>a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then the third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star burning like a torch fell from heaven and landed on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.
<span class="reftext">11</span>The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood oil,<span class="fn">a</span>  and many people died from the bitter waters.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then the fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun and moon and stars were struck. A third of the stars were darkened, a third of the day was without light, and a third of the night as well.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And as I observed, I heard an eagle flying overhead, calling in a loud voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the remaining three angels!”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">became wormwood</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
