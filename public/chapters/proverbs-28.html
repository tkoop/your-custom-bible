<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Boldness of the Righteous</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>The wicked flee when no one pursues, </p><p class="indent"> but the righteous are as bold as a lion.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>A land in rebellion has many rulers, </p><p class="indent"> but a man of understanding and knowledge maintains order.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>A destitute leader who oppresses the poor </p><p class="indent"> is like a driving rain that leaves no food.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, </p><p class="indent"> but those who keep the law resist them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Evil men do not understand justice, </p><p class="indent"> but those who seek the LORD comprehend fully.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Better a poor man who walks with integrity </p><p class="indent"> than a rich man whose ways are perverse.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>A discerning son keeps the law, </p><p class="indent"> but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>He who increases his wealth by interest and usury </p><p class="indent"> lays it up for one who is kind to the poor.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Whoever turns his ear away from hearing the law, </p><p class="indent"> even his prayer is detestable.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>He who leads the upright along the path of evil will fall into his own pit, </p><p class="indent"> but the blameless will inherit what is good.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>A rich man is wise in his own eyes, </p><p class="indent"> but a poor man with discernment sees through him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, </p><p class="indent"> but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>He who conceals his sins will not prosper, </p><p class="indent"> but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>Blessed is the man who is always reverent,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>Like a roaring lion or a charging bear </p><p class="indent"> is a wicked ruler over a helpless people.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>A leader who lacks judgment is also a great oppressor, </p><p class="indent"> but he who hates dishonest profit will prolong his days.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>A man burdened by bloodguilt will flee into the Pit;<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> let no one support him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>He who walks with integrity will be kept safe, </p><p class="indent"> but whoever is perverse in his ways will suddenly fall.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>The one who works his land will have plenty of food, </p><p class="indent"> but whoever chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>A faithful man will abound with blessings, </p><p class="indent"> but one eager to be rich will not go unpunished.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>To show partiality is not good, </p><p class="indent"> yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>A stingy man<span class="fn">c</span>  hastens after wealth </p><p class="indent"> and does not know that poverty awaits him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>He who rebukes a man will later find more favor </p><p class="indent"> than one who flatters with his tongue.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>He who robs his father or mother, saying, “It is not wrong,” </p><p class="indent"> is a companion to the man who destroys.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>A greedy man stirs up strife, </p><p class="indent"> but he who trusts in the LORD will prosper.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>He who trusts in himself is a fool, </p><p class="indent"> but one who walks in wisdom will be safe.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>Whoever gives to the poor will not be in need, </p><p class="indent"> but he who hides his eyes will receive many curses.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">28</span>When the wicked come to power, people hide themselves; </p><p class="indent"> but when they perish, the righteous flourish.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">always fears the LORD</i>; Hebrew does not include <i class="calibre6">the LORD</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">will be a fugitive until death</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">A man whose eye is evil</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
