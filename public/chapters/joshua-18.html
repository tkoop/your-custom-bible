<font >Then the whole congregation of Israel
assembled at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting there. And though
the land was subdued before them, there were still seven tribes of
Israel who had not yet received their inheritance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Joshua said to the Israelites, “How
long will you put off entering and possessing the land that the LORD,
the God of your fathers, has given you? Appoint three men from each
tribe, and I will send them out to survey the land and map it out,
according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me and
divide the land into seven portions. Judah shall remain in their
territory in the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their
territory in the north. When you have mapped out the seven portions
of land and brought it to me, I will cast lots for you here in the
presence of the LORD our God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Levites, however, have no portion
among you, because their inheritance is the priesthood of the LORD.
And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received
the inheritance that Moses the servant of the LORD gave them beyond
the Jordan to the east.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the men got up to go out, Joshua
commanded them to map out the land, saying, “Go and survey the
land, map it out, and return to me. Then I will cast lots for you
here in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the men departed and went throughout
the land, mapping it city by city into seven portions. Then they
returned with the document to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Joshua cast lots for them in the
presence of the LORD at Shiloh, where he distributed the land to the
Israelites according to their divisions. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The first lot came up for the clans of the
tribe of Benjamin. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of
Judah and Joseph: </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.4cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >On the north side their border began at
the Jordan, went up past the northern slope of Jericho, headed west
through the hill country, and came out at the wilderness of
Beth-aven. From there the border crossed over to the southern slope
of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth-addar on the hill
south of Lower Beth-horon. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >On the west side the border curved
southward from the hill facing Beth-horon on the south and came out
at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of
Judah. This was the western side. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >On the south side the border began at the
outskirts of Kiriath-jearim and extended westward to the spring at
the Waters of Nephtoah. Then it went down to the foot of the hill
that faces the Valley of Hinnom at the northern end of the Valley of
Rephaim and ran down the Valley of Hinnom toward the southern slope
of the Jebusites and downward to En-rogel. From there it curved
northward and proceeded to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth facing the
Ascent of Adummim, and continued down to the Stone of Bohan son of
Reuben. Then it went on to the northern slope of Beth-arabah and went
down into the valley. The border continued to the northern slope of
Beth-hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the
mouth of the Jordan. This was the southern border. </font>
