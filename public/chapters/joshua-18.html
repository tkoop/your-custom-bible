<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the whole congregation of Israel
assembled at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting there. And though
the land was subdued before them, there were still seven tribes of
Israel who had not yet received their inheritance. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Joshua said to the Israelites, “How
long will you put off entering and possessing the land that the LORD,
the God of your fathers, has given you? Appoint three men from each
tribe, and I will send them out to survey the land and map it out,
according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me and
divide the land into seven portions. Judah shall remain in their
territory in the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their
territory in the north. When you have mapped out the seven portions
of land and brought it to me, I will cast lots for you here in the
presence of the LORD our God. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Levites, however, have no portion
among you, because their inheritance is the priesthood of the LORD.
And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received
the inheritance that Moses the servant of the LORD gave them beyond
the Jordan to the east.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As the men got up to go out, Joshua
commanded them to map out the land, saying, “Go and survey the
land, map it out, and return to me. Then I will cast lots for you

the Jordan, went up past the northern slope of Jericho, headed west
through the hill country, and came out at the wilderness of

Rephaim and ran down the Valley of Hinnom toward the southern slope
of the Jebusites and downward to En-rogel. From there it curved
northward and proceeded to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth facing the
Ascent of Adummim, and continued down to the Stone of Bohan son of
Reuben. Then it went on to the northern slope of Beth-arabah and went
down into the valley. The border continued to the northern slope of
Beth-hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the
mouth of the Jordan. This was the southern border. </font>
