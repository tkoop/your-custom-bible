<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Remainder Divided</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the whole congregation of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span> there. And though the land was subdued before them,
<span class="reftext">2</span>there were still seven tribes of Israel who had not yet received their inheritance.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So Joshua said to the Israelites, “How long will you put off entering and possessing the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of your fathers, has given you?
<span class="reftext">4</span>Appoint three men from each tribe, and I will send them out to survey the land and map it out, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me
<span class="reftext">5</span>and divide the land into seven portions. Judah shall remain in their territory in the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory in the north.
<span class="reftext">6</span>When you have mapped out the seven portions of land and brought it to me, I will cast lots for you here in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>The Levites, however, have no portion among you, because their inheritance is the priesthood of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received the inheritance that Moses the servant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gave them beyond the Jordan to the east.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>As the men got up to go out, Joshua commanded them to map out the land, saying, “Go and survey the land, map it out, and return to me. Then I will cast lots for you here in Shiloh in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So the men departed and went throughout the land, mapping it city by city into seven portions. Then they returned with the document to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And Joshua cast lots for them in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> at Shiloh, where he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their divisions.
