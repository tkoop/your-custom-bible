<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The First Six Bowls of Wrath</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go, pour out on the earth the seven bowls of God’s wrath.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and loathsome, malignant sores broke out on those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it turned to blood like that of the dead, and every living thing in the sea died.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they turned to blood.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And I heard the angel of the waters say: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Righteous are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>, O <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span>, </p><p class="indent"> who is and was, </p><p class="indent"> because <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have brought these <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span>.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For they have spilled the blood of saints and prophets, </p><p class="indent"> and <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have given them blood to drink, </p><p class="indent"> as they deserve.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>And I heard the altar reply: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Yes, Lord God <span class='cap'>Almighty</span><span class='nocap'>almighty</span>, </p><p class="indent"> true and just are <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given power to scorch the people with fire.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the people were scorched by intense heat, and they cursed the name of God, who had authority over these plagues; yet they did not repent and give <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> glory.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness, and men began to gnaw their tongues in anguish
<span class="reftext">11</span>and curse the God of heaven for their pains and sores; yet they did not repent of their deeds.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings of the East.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouths of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet.
<span class="reftext">14</span>These are demonic spirits that perform signs and go out to all the kings of the earth, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the <span class='cap'>Almighty</span><span class='nocap'>almighty</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">15</span>“Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who remains awake and clothed, so that he will not go naked and let his shame be exposed.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And they assembled the kings in the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.
</p><p class="hdg">The Seventh Bowl of Wrath</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came from the throne in the temple, saying, “It is done!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And there were flashes of lightning, and rumblings, and peals of thunder, and a great earthquake the likes of which had not occurred since men were upon the earth—so mighty was the great quake.
<span class="reftext">19</span>The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. And God remembered Babylon the great and gave her the cup of the wine of the fury of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> wrath.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then every island fled, and no mountain could be found.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And great hailstones weighing almost a hundred pounds each<span class="fn">a</span>  rained down on them from above. And men cursed God for the plague of hail, because it was so horrendous.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">great hail as of a talent</i>; that is, hailstones weighing approximately 75.4 pounds or 34.2 kilograms each<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
