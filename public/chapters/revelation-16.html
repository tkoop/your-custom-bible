<font >Then I heard a loud voice from the temple
saying to the seven angels, “Go, pour out on the earth the seven
bowls of God’s wrath.” </font>

<font >And the third angel poured out his bowl

heard the angel of the waters say: </font>

<font >Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl
on the sun, and it was given power to scorch the people with fire.
And the people were scorched by intense heat, and they cursed the
name of God, who had authority over these plagues; yet they did not
repent and give Him glory. </font>

<font >And the fifth angel poured out his bowl on

heaven for their pains and sores; yet they did not repent of their
deeds. </font>
