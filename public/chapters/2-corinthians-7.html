<font >Therefore, beloved, since we have these
promises, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that defiles body
and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make room for us in your hearts. We have
wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one. I
do not say this to condemn you. I have said before that you so occupy
our hearts that we live and die together with you. Great is my
confidence in you; great is my pride in you; I am filled with
encouragement; in all our troubles my joy overflows. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For when we arrived in Macedonia, our
bodies had no rest, but we were pressed from every
direction—conflicts on the outside, fears within. But God, who
comforts the downcast, comforted us by the arrival of Titus, and not
only by his arrival, but also by the comfort he had received from
you. He told us about your longing, your mourning, and your zeal for
me, so that I rejoiced all the more. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter,
I do not regret it. Although I did regret it, I now see that my
letter caused you sorrow, but only for a short time. And now I
rejoice, not because you were made sorrowful, but because your sorrow
led you to repentance. For you felt the sorrow that God had intended,
and so were not harmed in any way by us. Godly sorrow brings
repentance that leads to salvation without regret, but worldly sorrow
brings death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Consider what this godly sorrow has
produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear
yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal,
what vindication! In every way you have proved yourselves to be
innocent in this matter. So even though I wrote to you, it was not on
account of the one who did wrong or the one who was harmed, but
rather that your earnestness on our behalf would be made clear to you
in the sight of God. On account of this, we are encouraged. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In addition to our own encouragement, we
were even more delighted by the joy of Titus. For his spirit has been
refreshed by all of you. Indeed, I was not embarrassed by anything I
had boasted to him about you. But just as everything we said to you
was true, so our boasting to Titus has proved to be true as well. And
his affection for you is even greater when he remembers that you were
all obedient as you welcomed him with fear and trembling. I rejoice
that I can have complete confidence in you. </font>
