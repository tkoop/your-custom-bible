<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Paul’s Joy in the Corinthians</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore, beloved, since we have these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that defiles body and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Make room for us in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.
<span class="reftext">3</span>I do not say this to condemn you. I have said before that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> so occupy our hearts that we live and die together with you.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Great is my confidence in <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>; great is my pride in <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>; I am filled with encouragement; in all our troubles my joy overflows.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>For when we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were pressed from every direction—conflicts on the outside, fears within.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the arrival of Titus,
<span class="reftext">7</span>and not only by his arrival, but also by the comfort he had received from <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. He told us about <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> longing, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> mourning, and <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> zeal for me, so that I rejoiced all the more.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Although I did regret it, I now see that my letter caused <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> sorrow, but only for a short time.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And now I rejoice, not because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were made sorrowful, but because <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sorrow led <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to repentance. For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> felt the sorrow that God had intended, and so were not harmed in any way by us.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation without regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Consider what this godly sorrow has produced in <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what vindication! In every way you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.
<span class="reftext">12</span>So even though I wrote to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, it was not on account of the one who did wrong or the one who was harmed, but rather that <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> earnestness on our behalf would be made clear to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in the sight of God.
<span class="reftext">13</span>On account of this, we are encouraged. </p><p class="reg1"> In addition to our own encouragement, we were even more delighted by the joy of Titus. For his spirit has been refreshed by all of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Indeed, I was not embarrassed by anything I had boasted to him about <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. But just as everything we said to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> was true, so our boasting to Titus has proved to be true as well.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And his affection for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> is even greater when he remembers that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were all obedient as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> welcomed him with fear and trembling.
<span class="reftext">16</span>I rejoice that I can have complete confidence in <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
