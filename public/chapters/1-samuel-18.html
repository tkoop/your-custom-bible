<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font ><b>Jonathan Befriends David</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After David had finished speaking with
Saul, the souls of Jonathan and David were knit together, and
Jonathan loved him as himself. And from that day Saul kept David with
him and did not let him return to his father’s house. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jonathan made a covenant with David
because he loved him as himself. And Jonathan removed the robe he was
wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, his sword, his
bow, and his belt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David marched out and prospered in
everything Saul sent him to do, and Saul set him over the men of war.
And this was pleasing in the sight of all the people, and of Saul’s
officers as well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the troops were returning home after
David had killed the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities
of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful
songs, and with tambourines and other instruments. And as the women
danced, they sang out: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Saul has slain his thousands, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and David his tens of thousands.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Saul was furious and resented this
song. “They have ascribed tens of thousands to David,” he said,
“but only thousands to me. What more can he have but the kingdom?”
And from that day forward Saul kept a jealous eye on David. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day a spirit of distress sent
from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied inside the house while
David played the harp as usual. Now Saul was holding a spear, and he
hurled it, thinking, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David
eluded him twice. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Saul was afraid of David, because the
LORD was with David but had departed from Saul. Therefore Saul sent
David away and gave him command of a thousand men. David led the
troops out to battle and back, and he continued to prosper in all his
ways, because the LORD was with him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Saul saw that David was very
successful, he was afraid of him. But all Israel and Judah loved
David, because he was leading them out to battle and back. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Saul said to David, “Here is my
older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage. Only be
valiant for me and fight the LORD’s battles.” But Saul was
thinking, “I need not raise my hand against him; let the hand of
the Philistines be against him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David said to Saul, “Who am I, and
what is my family or my father’s clan in Israel, that I should
become the son-in-law of the king?” So when it was time to give
Saul’s daughter Merab to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel
of Meholah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David,
and when this was reported to Saul, it pleased him. “I will give
her to David,” Saul thought, “so that she may be a snare to him,
and the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said
to David, “For a second time now you can be my son-in-law.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Saul ordered his servants, “Speak
to David privately and tell him, ‘Behold, the king is pleased with
you, and all his servants love you. Now therefore, become his
son-in-law.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when Saul’s servants relayed these
words to David, he replied, “Does it seem trivial in your sight to
be the son-in-law of the king? I am a poor man and lightly esteemed.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the servants told Saul what David had
said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Saul replied, “Say to David, ‘The king
desires no other dowry but a hundred Philistine foreskins as revenge
on his enemies.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
But Saul intended to cause David’s death at the hands of the
Philistines. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the servants reported these terms to
David, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the
wedding day arrived, David and his men went out and killed two
hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented them as
payment in full to become the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave his
daughter Michal to David in marriage. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Saul realized that the LORD was with
David and that his daughter Michal loved David, he grew even more
afraid of David. So from then on Saul was David’s enemy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Every time the Philistine commanders came
out for battle, David was more successful than all of Saul’s
officers, so that his name was highly esteemed. </font>
