<font ><b>Ambassadors for Christ</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now we know that if the earthly tent we
live in is dismantled, we have a building from God, an eternal house
in heaven, not built by human hands. For in this tent we groan,
longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, because when we are
clothed, we will not be found naked. So while we are in this tent, we
groan under our burdens, because we do not wish to be unclothed but
clothed, so that our mortality may be swallowed up by life. And God
has prepared us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as
a pledge of what is to come. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore we are always confident,
although we know that while we are at home in the body, we are away
from the Lord. For we walk by faith, not by sight. We are confident,
then, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the
Lord. So we aspire to please Him, whether we are here in this body or
away from it. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of
Christ, that each one may receive his due for the things done in the
body, whether good or bad. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, since we know what it means to
fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is clear to God,
and I hope it is clear to your conscience as well. We are not
commending ourselves to you again. Instead, we are giving you an
occasion to be proud of us, so that you can answer those who take
pride in appearances rather than in the heart. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If we are out of our mind, it is for God;
if we are of sound mind, it is for you. For Christ’s love compels
us, because we are convinced that One died for all, therefore all
died. And He died for all, that those who live should no longer live
for themselves, but for Him who died for them and was raised again. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So from now on we regard no one according
to the flesh. Although we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so
no longer. Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
The old has passed away. Behold, the new has come! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All this is from God, who reconciled us to
Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:
that God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ, not counting
men’s trespasses against them. And He has committed to us the
message of reconciliation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ,
as though God were making His appeal through us. We implore you on
behalf of Christ: Be reconciled to God. God made Him who knew no sin
to be sin on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the
righteousness of God. </font>
