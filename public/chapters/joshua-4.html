<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Twelve Stones from the Jordan</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Joshua,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and command them: ‘Take up for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests were standing, carry them with you, and set them down in the place where you spend the night.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So Joshua summoned the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe,
<span class="reftext">5</span>and said to them, “Cross over before the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of Israel,
<span class="reftext">6</span>to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’
<span class="reftext">7</span>you are to tell them, ‘The waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters were cut off.’ Therefore these stones will be a memorial to the Israelites forever.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Thus the Israelites did as Joshua had commanded them. They took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, one for each tribe of Israel, just as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had told Joshua; and they carried them to the camp, where they set them down.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan,<span class="fn">a</span>  in the place where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant stood. And the stones are there to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until the people had completed everything <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded Joshua to tell them, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried across,
<span class="reftext">11</span>and after everyone had finished crossing, the priests with the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> crossed in the sight of the people.
<span class="reftext">12</span>The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over before the Israelites, armed for battle as Moses had instructed them.
<span class="reftext">13</span>About 40,000 troops armed for battle crossed over before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> into the plains of Jericho.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>On that day <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they revered him all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Joshua,
<span class="reftext">16</span>“Command the priests who carry the ark of the Testimony<span class="fn">b</span>  to come up from the Jordan.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up from the Jordan.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>When the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came up out of the Jordan and their feet touched the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their course and overflowed all the banks as before.
</p><p class="hdg">The Camp at Gilgal</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And there at Gilgal Joshua set up the twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then Joshua said to the Israelites, “In the future, when your children ask their fathers, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’
<span class="reftext">22</span>you are to tell them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’
<span class="reftext">23</span>For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as He did to the Red Sea,<span class="fn">c</span>  which He dried up before us until we had crossed over.
<span class="reftext">24</span>He did this so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is mighty, and so that you may always fear <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Some translators <i class="calibre6">And Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been in the middle of the Jordan</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, <i class="calibre6">the ark of the covenant</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Sea of Reeds</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
