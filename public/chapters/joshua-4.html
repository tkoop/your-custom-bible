<font ><b>Twelve Stones from the Jordan</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the whole nation had finished
crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua, “Choose twelve men
from among the people, one from each tribe, and command them: ‘Take
up for yourselves twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where
the priests were standing, carry them with you, and set them down in
the place where you spend the night.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Joshua summoned the twelve men he had
appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe, and said to them,
“Cross over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of
the Jordan. Each of you is to take a stone upon his shoulder,
according to the number of the tribes of Israel, to serve as a sign
among you. In the future, when your children ask, ‘What do these
stones mean to you?’ you are to tell them, ‘The waters of the
Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When
it crossed the Jordan, the waters were cut off.’ Therefore these
stones will be a memorial to the Israelites forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus the Israelites did as Joshua had
commanded them. They took up twelve stones from the middle of the
Jordan, one for each tribe of Israel, just as the LORD had told
Joshua; and they carried them to the camp, where they set them down. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Joshua also set up twelve stones in the
middle of the Jordan, in the place where the priests who carried the
ark of the covenant stood. And the stones are there to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the priests who carried the ark
remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until the people had
completed everything the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell them, just
as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried across, and after
everyone had finished crossing, the priests with the ark of the LORD
crossed in the sight of the people. The Reubenites, the Gadites, and
the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over before the Israelites, armed
for battle as Moses had instructed them. About 40,000 troops armed
for battle crossed over before the LORD into the plains of Jericho. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the
sight of all Israel, and they revered him all the days of his life,
just as they had revered Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Command
the priests who carry the ark of the Testimony to come up from the
Jordan.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come
up from the Jordan.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the priests carrying the ark of the
covenant of the LORD came up out of the Jordan and their feet touched
the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their course and
overflowed all the banks as before. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the tenth day of the first month the
people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern
border of Jericho. And there at Gilgal Joshua set up the twelve
stones they had taken from the Jordan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Joshua said to the Israelites, “In
the future, when your children ask their fathers, ‘What is the
meaning of these stones?’ you are to tell them, ‘Israel crossed
the Jordan on dry ground.’ For the LORD your God dried up the
waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as
He did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had
crossed over. He did this so that all the peoples of the earth may
know that the hand of the LORD is mighty, and so that you may always
fear the LORD your God.” </font>
