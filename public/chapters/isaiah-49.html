</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>He made My mouth like a sharp sword; </p><p class="indent"> He hid Me in the shadow of His hand. </p><p class="indent1"> He made Me like a polished arrow; </p><p class="indent"> He hid Me in His quiver.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>He said to Me, “You are My Servant, Israel, </p><p class="indent"> in whom I will display My glory.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>But I said, “I have laboured in vain, </p><p class="indent"> I have spent My strength in futility and vanity; </p><p class="indent1"> yet My vindication is with the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> and My reward is with My God.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>And now says the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant, </p><p class="indent1"> to bring Jacob back to Him, </p><p class="indent"> that Israel might be gathered to Him—</p><p class="indent1"> for I am honoured in the sight of the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> and My God is My strength—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>He says: “It is not enough for You to be My Servant, </p><p class="indent"> to raise up the tribes of Jacob, </p><p class="indent"> and to restore the protected ones of Israel. </p><p class="indent1"> I will also make You a light for the nations, </p><p class="indent"> to bring My salvation to the ends of the earth.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>Thus says the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel, </p><p class="indent1"> to Him who was despised and abhorred by the nation, </p><p class="indent"> to the Servant of rulers: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Kings will see You and rise, </p><p class="indent"> and princes will bow down, </p><p class="indent1"> because of the LORD, who is faithful, </p><p class="indent"> the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen You.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>This is what the LORD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“In the time of favour I will answer You, </p><p class="indent"> and in the day of salvation I will help You;<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> I will keep You and appoint You </p><p class="indent"> to be a covenant for the people, </p><p class="indent1"> to restore the land, </p><p class="indent"> to apportion its desolate inheritances,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>to say to the prisoners, ‘Come out,’ </p><p class="indent"> and to those in darkness, ‘Show yourselves.’ </p><p class="indent1"> They will feed along the pathways, </p><p class="indent"> and find pasture on every barren hill.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>They will not hunger or thirst, </p><p class="indent"> nor will scorching heat or sun beat down on them.<span class="fn">d</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> For He who has compassion on them will guide them </p><p class="indent"> and lead them beside springs of water.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>I will turn all My mountains into roads, </p><p class="indent"> and My highways will be raised up.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Behold, they will come from far away, </p><p class="indent"> from the north and from the west,<span class="fn">e</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and from the land of Aswan.<span class="fn">f</span>”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Shout for joy, O heavens; rejoice, O earth; </p><p class="indent"> break forth in song, O mountains! </p><p class="indent1"> For the LORD has comforted His people, </p><p class="indent"> and He will have compassion on His afflicted ones.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>But Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me; </p><p class="indent"> the Lord has forgotten me!”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>“Can a woman forget her nursing child, </p><p class="indent"> or lack compassion for the son of her womb? </p><p class="indent1"> Even if she could forget, </p><p class="indent"> I will not forget you!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands; </p><p class="indent"> your walls are ever before Me.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Lift up your eyes and look around. </p><p class="indent"> They all gather together; they come to you. </p><p class="indent1"> As surely as I live,” declares the LORD, </p><p class="indent">“you will wear them all as jewellery </p><p class="indent"> and put them on like a bride.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>For your ruined and desolate places </p><p class="indent"> and your ravaged land </p><p class="indent1"> will now indeed be too small for your people, </p><p class="indent"> and those who devoured you will be far away.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Yet the children of your bereavement </p><p class="indent"> will say in your hearing, </p><p class="indent1">‘This place is too small for us; </p><p class="indent"> make room for us to live here.’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then you will say in your heart, </p><p class="indent">‘Who has begotten these for me? </p><p class="indent1"> I was bereaved and barren; </p><p class="indent"> I was exiled and rejected. </p><p class="indent"> So who has reared them? </p><p class="indent1"> Look, I was left all alone, </p><p class="indent"> so where did they come from?’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations, </p><p class="indent"> and raise My banner to the peoples. </p><p class="indent1"> They will bring your sons in their arms<span class="fn">h</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and carry your daughters on their shoulders.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Kings will be your foster fathers, </p><p class="indent"> and their queens your nursing mothers. </p><p class="indent1"> They will bow to you facedown </p><p class="indent"> and lick the dust at your feet. </p><p class="indent1"> Then you will know that I am the LORD; </p><p class="indent"> those who hope in Me will never be put to shame.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>Can the plunder be snatched from the mighty, </p><p class="indent"> or the captives of a tyrant<span class="fn">i</span>  be delivered?
