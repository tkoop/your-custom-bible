<font ><b>Mourning and Burial</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Joseph fell upon his father’s face,
wept over him, and kissed him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Joseph directed the physicians in his
service to embalm his father Israel. So they embalmed him, taking the
forty days required to complete the embalming. And the Egyptians
mourned for him seventy days. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the days of mourning had passed,
Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court, “If I have found favor in your
eyes, please tell Pharaoh that my father made me swear an oath when
he said, ‘I am about to die. You must bury me in the tomb that I
dug for myself in the land of Canaan.’ Now let me go and bury my
father, and then return.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Pharaoh replied, “Go up and bury your
father, as he made you swear to do.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Joseph went to bury his father, and
all the servants of Pharaoh accompanied him—the elders of Pharaoh’s
household and all the elders of the land of Egypt— along with all
of Joseph’s household, and his brothers, and his father’s
household. Only their children and flocks and herds were left in
Goshen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Chariots and horsemen alike went up with
him, and it was an exceedingly large procession. When they reached
the threshing floor of Atad, which is across the Jordan, they
lamented and wailed loudly, and Joseph mourned for his father seven
days. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Canaanites of the land saw the
mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a
solemn ceremony of mourning by the Egyptians.” Thus the place
across the Jordan is called Abel-mizraim. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jacob’s sons did as he had charged
them. They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the
cave at Machpelah in the field near Mamre, which Abraham had
purchased from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Joseph had buried his father, he
returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him to
bury his father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Joseph’s brothers saw that their
father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph bears a grudge? Then he
will surely repay us for all the evil that we did to him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they sent word to Joseph, saying,
“Before he died, your father commanded, ‘This is what you are to
say to Joseph: I beg you, please forgive the transgression and sin of
your brothers, for they did you wrong.’ So now, Joseph, please
forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When their message came to him, Joseph
wept. His brothers also came to him, bowed down before him, and said,
“We are your slaves!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Joseph replied, “Do not be afraid.
Am I in the place of God? As for you, what you intended against me
for evil, God intended for good, in order to accomplish a day like
this—to preserve the lives of many people. Therefore do not be
afraid. I will provide for you and your little ones.” So Joseph
reassured his brothers and spoke kindly to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Joseph and his father’s household
remained in Egypt, and Joseph lived to the age of 110. He saw
Ephraim’s sons to the third generation, and indeed the sons of
Machir son of Manasseh were brought up on Joseph’s knees. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am
about to die, but God will surely visit you and bring you up from
this land to the land He promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob.” And Joseph made the sons of Israel take an oath and said,
“God will surely attend to you, and then you must carry my bones up
from this place.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Joseph died at the age of 110. And they
embalmed his body and placed it in a coffin in Egypt. </font>
