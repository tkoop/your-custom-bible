<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Ark Returned to Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had been in the land of the Philistines seven months,
<span class="reftext">2</span>the Philistines summoned the priests and diviners, saying, “What shall we do with the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>? Tell us how to send it back to its place.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>They replied, “If you return the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it away empty, but by all means return it to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> with a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hand has not been lifted from you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“What guilt offering should we send back to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>?” asked the Philistines. </p><p class="reg1">“Five gold tumors and five gold rats,” they said, “according to the number of rulers of the Philistines, since the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Make images of your tumors and of the rats that are ravaging the land. Give glory to the God of Israel, and perhaps <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will lift <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hand from you and your gods and your land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Why harden<span class="fn">a</span>  your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs? When <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> afflicted them, did they not send the people on their way as they departed?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now, therefore, prepare one new cart with two milk cows that have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Take the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, set it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> as a guilt offering. </p><p class="reg1"> Then send the ark on its way,
<span class="reftext">9</span>but keep watching it. If it goes up the road to its homeland, toward Beth-shemesh, it is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> who has brought on us this great disaster. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hand that punished us and that it happened by chance.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So the men did as instructed. They took two milk cows, hitched them to the cart, and penned up their calves.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Then they put the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> on the cart, along with the chest containing the gold rats and the images of the tumors.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And the cows headed straight up the road toward Beth-shemesh, staying on that one highway and lowing as they went, never straying to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed behind them to the border of Beth-shemesh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Now the people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they were overjoyed at the sight.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there near a large rock. The people chopped up the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the Levites took down the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and the chest containing the gold objects, and they placed them on the large rock. That day the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And when the five rulers of the Philistines saw this, they returned to Ekron that same day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>As a guilt offering to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the Philistines had sent back one gold <span class='spell ca'>tumour</span><span class='spell gb'>tumour</span><span class='spell us'>tumor</span> for each city: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.
<span class="reftext">18</span>The number of gold rats also corresponded to the number of Philistine cities belonging to the five rulers—the fortified cities and their outlying villages. And the large rock<span class="fn">b</span>  on which they placed the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> stands to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>But God struck down some of the people of Beth-shemesh because they looked inside the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. He struck down seventy men,<span class="fn">c</span>  and the people mourned because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had struck them with a great slaughter.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>The men of Beth-shemesh asked, “Who can stand in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, this holy God? To whom should the ark go up from here?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>So they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. Come down and take it up with you.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">make heavy</i>; similarly again in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">great meadow</i>; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Abel-haggedolah</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> A few late Hebrew manuscripts and Josephus; most Hebrew manuscripts <i class="calibre6">70 men and 50,000 men</i>; LXX <i class="calibre6">70 men and 50,000 men of the people</i>; Syriac and Arabic <i class="calibre6">70 men and 5,000 men</i>; alternately, possibly <i class="calibre6">70 men and 50 oxen</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
