</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>The threshing floor and winepress will not feed them, </p><p class="indent"> and the new wine will fail them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>They will not remain </p><p class="indent"> in the land of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>; </p><p class="indent1"> Ephraim<span class="fn">a</span>  will return to Egypt </p><p class="indent"> and eat unclean food in Assyria.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>They will not pour out wine offerings to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, </p><p class="indent"> and their sacrifices will not please <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, </p><p class="indent1"> but will be to them like the bread of mourners; </p><p class="indent"> all who eat will be defiled. </p><p class="indent1"> For their bread will be for themselves; </p><p class="indent"> it will not enter the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>The days of punishment have come; </p><p class="indent"> the days of retribution have arrived—</p><p class="indent"> let Israel know it. </p><p class="indent1"> The prophet is called a fool, </p><p class="indent"> and the inspired man insane, </p><p class="indent1"> because of the greatness </p><p class="indent"> of your iniquity and hostility.

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. </p><p class="indent"> I saw your fathers as the firstfruits </p><p class="indent"> of the fig tree in its first season. </p><p class="indent1"> But they went to Baal-peor, </p><p class="indent"> and consecrated themselves to Shame; </p><p class="indent1"> so they became as detestable </p><p class="indent"> as the thing they loved.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Ephraim’s glory will fly away like a bird, </p><p class="indent"> with no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, </p><p class="indent"> planted in a meadow. </p><p class="indent1"> But Ephraim will bring out </p><p class="indent"> his children for slaughter.
