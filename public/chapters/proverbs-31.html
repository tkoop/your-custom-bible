<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Sayings for King Lemuel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>These are the words of King Lemuel—the burden that his mother taught him:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>What shall I say,<span class="fn">a</span>  O my son? </p><p class="indent"> What, O son of my womb? </p><p class="indent"> What, O son of my vows?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Do not spend your strength on women </p><p class="indent"> or your <span class='spell ca'>vigour</span><span class='spell gb'>vigour</span><span class='spell us'>vigor</span> on those who ruin kings.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>It is not for kings, O Lemuel, </p><p class="indent"> it is not for kings to drink wine, </p><p class="indent"> or for rulers to crave strong drink,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>lest they drink and forget what is decreed, </p><p class="indent"> depriving all the oppressed of justice.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Give strong drink to one who is perishing, </p><p class="indent"> and wine to the bitter in soul.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Let him drink and forget his poverty, </p><p class="indent"> and remember his misery no more.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Open your mouth for those with no voice, </p><p class="indent"> for the cause of all the dispossessed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Open your mouth, judge righteously, </p><p class="indent"> and defend the cause of the poor and needy.
</p><p class="hdg">The Virtues of a Noble Woman</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>A wife<span class="fn">b</span>  of noble character, who can find? </p><p class="indent"> She is far more precious than rubies.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>The heart of her husband trusts in her, </p><p class="indent">and he lacks nothing of value.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>She brings him good and not harm </p><p class="indent"> all the days of her life.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>She selects wool and flax </p><p class="indent"> and works with eager hands.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>She is like the merchant ships, </p><p class="indent"> bringing her food from afar.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>She rises while it is still night </p><p class="indent"> to provide food for her household </p><p class="indent"> and portions for her maidservants.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>She appraises a field and buys it; </p><p class="indent"> from her earnings she plants a vineyard.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>She girds herself<span class="fn">c</span>  with strength </p><p class="indent"> and shows that her arms are strong.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>She sees that her gain is good, </p><p class="indent"> and her lamp is not extinguished at night.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>She stretches out her hands to the distaff </p><p class="indent"> and grasps the spindle with her fingers.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>She opens her arms to the poor </p><p class="indent"> and reaches out her hands to the needy.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>When it snows, she has no fear for her household, </p><p class="indent"> for they are all clothed in scarlet.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>She makes coverings for her bed; </p><p class="indent"> her clothing is fine linen and purple.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Her husband is known at the city gate, </p><p class="indent"> where he sits among the elders of the land.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>She makes linen garments and sells them; </p><p class="indent"> she delivers sashes to the merchants.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>Strength and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> are her clothing, </p><p class="indent"> and she can laugh at the days to come.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>She opens her mouth with wisdom, </p><p class="indent"> and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>She watches over the affairs of her household </p><p class="indent"> and does not eat the bread of idleness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Her children rise up and call her blessed; </p><p class="indent"> her husband praises her as well:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>“Many daughters have done noble things, </p><p class="indent"> but you surpass them all!”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">30</span>Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, </p><p class="indent"> but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Give her the fruit of her hands, </p><p class="indent"> and let her works praise her at the gates.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">What</i> or <i class="calibre6">What are you doing</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Verses 10–31 are an acrostic poem, each verse beginning with the successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">She girds her loins</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">doubly clothed</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
