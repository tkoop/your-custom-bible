</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“How long will you go on saying such things? </p><p class="indent"> The words of your mouth are a blustering wind.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Does God pervert justice? </p><p class="indent"> Does the <span class='cap'>Almighty</span><span class='nocap'>almighty</span> pervert what is right?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When your children sinned against <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, </p><p class="indent"> He gave them over to their rebellion.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But if you would earnestly seek God </p><p class="indent"> and ask the <span class='cap'>Almighty</span><span class='nocap'>almighty</span> for mercy,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>if you are pure and upright, </p><p class="indent"> even now <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will rouse <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> on your behalf </p><p class="indent"> and restore your righteous estate.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Though your beginnings were modest, </p><p class="indent"> your latter days will flourish.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Please inquire of past generations </p><p class="indent"> and consider the discoveries of their fathers.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>For we were born yesterday and know nothing; </p><p class="indent"> our days on earth are but a shadow.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Will they not teach you and tell you, </p><p class="indent"> and speak from their understanding?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh? </p><p class="indent"> Do reeds flourish without water?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>While the shoots are still uncut, </p><p class="indent"> they dry up quicker than grass.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Such is the destiny of all who forget God; </p><p class="indent"> so the hope of the godless will perish.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>His confidence is fragile; </p><p class="indent"> his security is in a spider’s web.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>He leans on his web, but it gives way; </p><p class="indent"> he holds fast, but it does not endure.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine, </p><p class="indent"> spreading its shoots over the garden.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>His roots wrap around the rock heap; </p><p class="indent"> he looks for a home among the stones.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>If he is uprooted from his place, </p><p class="indent"> it will disown him, saying, ‘I never saw you.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Surely this is the joy of his way; </p><p class="indent"> yet others will spring from the dust.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Behold, God does not reject the blameless, </p><p class="indent"> nor will <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> strengthen the hand of evildoers.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, </p><p class="indent"> and your lips with a shout of joy.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Your enemies will be clothed in shame, </p><p class="indent"> and the tent of the wicked will be no more.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
