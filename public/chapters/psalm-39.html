<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">I Will Watch My Ways</p><p class="pshdg"><span class="reftext"></span>For the choirmaster. For Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. </p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>I said, “I will watch my ways </p><p class="indent"> so that I will not sin with my tongue; </p><p class="indent1"> I will guard my mouth with a muzzle </p><p class="indent"> as long as the wicked are present.”
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>I was speechless and still; </p><p class="indent"> I remained silent, even from speaking good, </p><p class="indent"> and my sorrow was stirred.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>My heart grew hot within me; </p><p class="indent"> as I mused, the fire burned. </p><p class="indent1stline"> Then I spoke with my tongue:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>“Show me, O LORD, my end </p><p class="indent"> and the measure of my days. </p><p class="indent"> Let me know how fleeting my life is.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>You, indeed, have made my days as handbreadths, </p><p class="indent"> and my lifetime as nothing before You. </p><p class="indent1"> Truly each man at his best </p><p class="indent"> exists as but a breath. </p><p class="selah"> Selah
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Surely every man goes about like a phantom; </p><p class="indent"> surely he bustles in vain; </p><p class="indent1"> he heaps up riches </p><p class="indent"> not knowing who will haul them away.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>And now, O Lord, for what do I wait? </p><p class="indent"> My hope is in You.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Deliver me from all my transgressions; </p><p class="indent"> do not make me the reproach of fools.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>I have become mute; </p><p class="indent"> I do not open my mouth </p><p class="indent"> because of what You have done.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Remove Your scourge from me; </p><p class="indent"> I am perishing by the force of Your hand.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>You discipline and correct a man for his iniquity, </p><p class="indent"> consuming like a moth what he holds dear; </p><p class="indent"> surely each man is but a vapour. </p><p class="selah"> Selah
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Hear my prayer, O LORD, </p><p class="indent"> and give ear to my cry for help; </p><p class="indent1"> do not be deaf to my weeping. </p><p class="indent"> For I am a foreigner dwelling with You, </p><p class="indent"> a stranger like all my fathers.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Turn Your gaze away from me, </p><p class="indent"> that I may again be cheered </p><p class="indent"> before I depart and am no more.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
