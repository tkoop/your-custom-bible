<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Circumcision and Passover at Gilgal</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast<span class="fn">a</span>  heard how <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over,<span class="fn">b</span>  their hearts melted and their spirits failed for fear of the Israelites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>At that time <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel once again.<span class="fn">c</span>”
<span class="reftext">3</span>So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now this is why Joshua circumcised them: All those who came out of Egypt—all the men of war—had died on the journey in the wilderness after they had left Egypt.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Though all who had come out were circumcised, none of those born in the wilderness on the journey from Egypt had been circumcised.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness forty years, until all the nation’s men of war who had come out of Egypt had died, since they did not obey <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> vowed never to let them see the land He had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And Joshua raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones he circumcised. Until this time they were still uncircumcised, since they had not been circumcised along the way.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And after all the nation had been circumcised, they stayed there in the camp until they were healed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” So that place has been called Gilgal<span class="fn">e</span>  to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while the Israelites were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they kept the Passover.
<span class="reftext">11</span>The day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain from the produce of the land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And the day after they had eaten from the produce of the land, the manna ceased. There was no more manna for the Israelites, so that year they began to eat the crops of the land of Canaan.
</p><p class="hdg">The Commander of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s Army</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in His hand. Joshua approached Him and asked, “Are You for us or for our enemies?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>“Neither,” He replied. “I have now come as Commander of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s army.” </p><p class="reg1"> Then Joshua fell facedown in reverence<span class="fn">f</span>  and asked Him, “What does my Lord have to say to His servant?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The Commander of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s army replied, “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.” </p><p class="reg1"> And Joshua did so.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, along the Mediterranean coast; literally <i class="calibre6">along the sea</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">until we had crossed over</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">again the second time</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Gibeath-haaraloth</i> means <i class="calibre6">the hill of the foreskins</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Gilgal</i> sounds like the Hebrew for <i class="calibre6">roll</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">and paid homage</i> or <i class="calibre6">and worshiped</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
