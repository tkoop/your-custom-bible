<font ><b>Elisha’s Final Prophecy</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the twenty-third year of the reign of
Joash son of Ahaziah over Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of
Israel, and he reigned in Samaria seventeen years. And he did evil in
the sight of the LORD and followed the sins that Jeroboam son of
Nebat had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them. So
the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He delivered them
continually into the hands of Hazael king of Aram and his son
Ben-hadad. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehoahaz sought the favor of the
LORD, and the LORD listened to him because He saw the oppression that
the king of Aram had inflicted on Israel. So the LORD gave Israel a
deliverer, and they escaped the power of the Arameans. Then the
people of Israel lived in their own homes as they had before. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, they did not turn away from
the sins that the house of Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit, but
they continued to walk in them. The Asherah pole even remained
standing in Samaria. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoahaz had no army left, except fifty
horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers, because the
king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at
threshing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz,
along with all his accomplishments and his might, are they not
written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehoahaz rested with his fathers and
was buried in Samaria. And his son Jehoash reigned in his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the thirty-seventh year of the reign of
Joash over Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in
Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years. And he did evil in the sight
of the LORD and did not turn away from all the sins that Jeroboam son
of Nebat had caused Israel to commit, but he walked in them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Jehoash,
along with all his accomplishments and his might, including his war
against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of
the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehoash rested with his fathers, and
Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria
with the kings of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Elisha had fallen sick with the
illness from which he would die, Jehoash king of Israel came down to
him and wept over him, saying, “My father, my father, the chariots
and horsemen of Israel!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Elisha told him, “Take a bow and some
arrows.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jehoash took a bow and some arrows. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Elisha said to the king of Israel,
“Put your hand on the bow.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king put his hand on the bow, and
Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Open the east window,” said Elisha. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he opened it and Elisha said, “Shoot!”
So he shot. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Elisha declared: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >This is the LORD’s arrow of victory, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >the arrow of victory over Aram, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >for you shall strike the Arameans in Aphek
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >until you have put an end to them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Elisha said, “Take the arrows!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he took them, and Elisha said to the
king of Israel, “Strike the ground!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he struck the ground three times and
stopped. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the man of God was angry with him and
said, “You should have struck the ground five or six times. Then
you would have struck down Aram until you had put an end to it. But
now you will strike down Aram only three times.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Elisha died and was buried. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Moabite raiders used to come into
the land every spring. Once, as the Israelites were burying a man,
suddenly they saw a band of raiders, so they threw the man’s body
into Elisha’s tomb. And as soon as his body touched the bones of
Elisha, the man was revived and stood up on his feet. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel
throughout the reign of Jehoahaz. But the LORD was gracious to Israel
and had compassion on them, and He turned toward them because of His
covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And to this day, the LORD
has been unwilling to destroy them or cast them from His presence. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Hazael king of Aram died, his son
Ben-hadad reigned in his place. Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz took
back from Ben-hadad son of Hazael the cities that Hazael had taken in
battle from his father Jehoahaz. Jehoash defeated Ben-hadad three
times, and so recovered the cities of Israel. </font>
