<span class="reftext">2</span>And he did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and followed the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against Israel, and He delivered them continually into the hands of Hazael king of Aram and his son Ben-hadad.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Jehoahaz sought the <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> listened to him because He saw the oppression that the king of Aram had inflicted on Israel.
<span class="reftext">5</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gave Israel a deliverer, and they escaped the power of the Arameans. Then the people of Israel lived in their own homes as they had before.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins that the house of Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit, but they continued to walk in them.<span class="fn">a</span>  The Asherah pole even remained standing in Samaria.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Jehoahaz had no army left, except fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers, because the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>As for the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, along with all his accomplishments and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And Jehoahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And his son Jehoash<span class="fn">b</span>  reigned in his place.
</p><p class="hdg">Jehoash Reigns in Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>In the thirty-seventh year of the reign of Joash over Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And he did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and did not turn away from all the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit, but he walked in them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>As for the rest of the acts of Jehoash, along with all his accomplishments and his might, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And Jehoash rested with his fathers, and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
</p><p class="hdg">Elisha’s Final Prophecy</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When Elisha had fallen sick with the illness from which he would die, Jehoash king of Israel came down to him and wept over him, saying, “My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Elisha told him, “Take a bow and some arrows.” </p><p class="reg1"> So Jehoash took a bow and some arrows.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Put your hand on the bow.” </p><p class="reg1"> So the king put his hand on the bow, and Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>“Open the east window,” said Elisha. </p><p class="reg1"> So he opened it and Elisha said, “Shoot!” So he shot. </p><p class="reg1"> And Elisha declared: </p><p class="indent1stline">“This is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s arrow of victory, </p><p class="indent"> the arrow of victory over Aram, </p><p class="indent1"> for you shall strike the Arameans in Aphek </p><p class="indent"> until you have put an end to them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then Elisha said, “Take the arrows!” </p><p class="reg1"> So he took them, and Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground!” </p><p class="reg1"> So he struck the ground three times and stopped.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>But the man of God was angry with him and said, “You should have struck the ground five or six times. Then you would have struck down Aram until you had put an end to it. But now you will strike down Aram only three times.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Elisha died and was buried. </p><p class="reg1"> Now the Moabite raiders used to come into the land every spring.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Once, as the Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders, so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb. And as soon as his body touched the bones of Elisha, the man was revived and stood up on his feet.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz.
<span class="reftext">23</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was gracious to Israel and had compassion on them, and He turned toward them because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And to this day, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has been unwilling to destroy them or cast them from His presence.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>When Hazael king of Aram died, his son Ben-hadad reigned in his place.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz took back from Ben-hadad son of Hazael the cities that Hazael had taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz. Jehoash defeated Ben-hadad three times, and so recovered the cities of Israel.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX, Syriac, Targum Yonaton, and Vulgate; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">he continued to walk in them</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Joash</i>, a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jehoash</i>; also in verses 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 25<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">into the land at the coming in of the year</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
