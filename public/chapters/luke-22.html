<font ><b>The Last Supper</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called
the Passover, was approaching, and the chief priests and scribes were
looking for a way to put Jesus to death; for they feared the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, who was
one of the Twelve. And Judas went to discuss with the chief priests
and temple officers how he might betray Jesus to them. They were
delighted and agreed to give him money. Judas consented, and began to
look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a
crowd. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on
which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed. Jesus sent Peter and
John, saying, <font color="#a80000">“Go and prepare for us to eat
the Passover.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Where do You want us to prepare it?”
they asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He answered, <font color="#a80000">“When
you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you.
Follow him to the house he enters, and say to the owner of that
house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat
the Passover with My disciples?’ And he will show you a large upper
room, already furnished. Make preparations there.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they went and found it just as Jesus
had told them. And they prepared the Passover. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at
the table with His apostles. And He said to them, <font color="#a80000">“I
have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before My
suffering. For I tell you that I will not eat it again until it is
fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After taking the cup, He gave thanks and
said, <font color="#a80000">“Take this and divide it among
yourselves. For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the
vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And He took the bread, gave thanks and
broke it, and gave it to them, saying, <font color="#a80000">“This
is My body, given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the same way, after supper He took the
cup, saying, <font color="#a80000">“This cup is the new covenant in
My blood, which is poured out for you. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Look! The hand of My
betrayer is with Mine on the table. Indeed, the Son of Man will go as
it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they began to question among
themselves which of them was going to do this. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A dispute also arose among the disciples
as to which of them would be considered the greatest. So Jesus
declared, <font color="#a80000">“The kings of the Gentiles lord it
over them, and those in authority over them call themselves
benefactors. But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest
among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the
one who serves. For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table
or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among
you as one who serves.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >You are the ones who
have stood by Me in My trials. And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as
My Father has bestowed one on Me, so that you may eat and drink at My
table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Simon, Simon, Satan
has asked to sift each of you like wheat. But I have prayed for you,
Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back,
strengthen your brothers.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to
go with You even to prison and to death.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“I
tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have
denied three times that you know Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus asked them, <font color="#a80000">“When
I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack
anything?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Nothing,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Now, however,”</font>
He told them, <font color="#a80000">“the one with a purse should
take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell
his cloak and buy one. For I tell you that this Scripture must be
fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’
For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two
swords.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >That is enough,”</font>
He answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of
Olives, and the disciples followed Him. When He came to the place, He
told them, <font color="#a80000">“Pray that you will not enter into
temptation.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And He withdrew about a stone’s throw
beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed, <font color="#a80000">“Father,
if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours
be done.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him
and strengthened Him. And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly,
and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus rose from prayer and returned
to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. <font color="#a80000">“Why
are you sleeping?”</font> He asked. <font color="#a80000">“Get up
and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While He was still speaking, a crowd
arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He
approached Jesus to kiss Him. But Jesus asked him, <font color="#a80000">“Judas,
are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Those around Jesus saw what was about to
happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” And
one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his
right ear. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“No
more of this!”</font> And He touched the man’s ear and healed
him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to the chief priests,
temple officers, and elders who had come for Him, <font color="#a80000">“Have
you come out with swords and clubs as you would against an outlaw?
Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a
hand on Me. But this hour belongs to you and to the power of
darkness.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they seized Jesus, led Him away, and
took Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a
distance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When those present had kindled a fire in
the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down
among them. A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked
intently at him. “This man also was with Him,” she said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Peter denied it. “Woman, I do not
know Him,” he said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A short time later, someone else saw him
and said, “You also are one of them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Peter said, “Man, I am not.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >About an hour later, another man insisted,
“Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Man, I do not know what you are talking
about,” Peter replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While he was still speaking, the rooster
crowed. And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Peter remembered the word that the
Lord had spoken to him: <font color="#a80000">“Before the rooster
crows today, you will deny Me three times.”</font> And he went
outside and wept bitterly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The men who were holding Jesus began to
mock Him and beat Him. They blindfolded Him and kept demanding,
“Prophesy! Who hit You?” And they said many other blasphemous
things against Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At daybreak the council of the elders of
the people, both the chief priests and scribes, met together. They
led Jesus into their Sanhedrin and said, “If You are the Christ,
tell us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“If
I tell you, you will not believe. And if I ask you a question, you
will not answer. But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the
right hand of the power of God.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they all asked, “Are You then the Son
of God?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He replied, <font color="#a80000">“You
say that I am.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Why do we need any more testimony?”
they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.”
