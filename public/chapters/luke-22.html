<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Plot to Kill Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:1–5; Mark 14:1–2; John 11:45–57)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread,<span class="fn">a</span>  called the Passover, was approaching,
<span class="reftext">2</span>and the chief priests and scribes were looking for a way to put Jesus to death; for they feared the people.
</p><p class="hdg">Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:14–16; Mark 14:10–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Satan entered Judas Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Judas went to discuss with the chief priests and temple officers how he might betray Jesus to them.
<span class="reftext">5</span>They were delighted and agreed to give him money.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Judas consented, and began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a crowd.
</p><p class="hdg">Preparing the Passover<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:17–19; Mark 14:12–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, <span>“Go and prepare for us to eat the Passover.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“Where do You want us to prepare it?” they asked.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>He answered, <span>“When you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters,
<span class="reftext">11</span>and say to the owner of that house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’
<span class="reftext">12</span>And he will show you a large upper room, already furnished. Make preparations there.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So they went and found it just as Jesus had told them. And they prepared the Passover.
</p><p class="hdg">The Last Supper<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:20–30; Mark 14:17–26; 1 Corinthians 11:17–34)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When the hour had come, Jesus reclined at the table with His apostles.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And He said to them, <span>“I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before My suffering.
<span class="reftext">16</span>For I tell you that I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>After taking the cup, He gave thanks and said, <span>“Take this and divide it among yourselves.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now on until the kingdom of God comes.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And He took the bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, <span>“This is My body, given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, <span>“This cup is the new covenant in My blood, which is poured out for you.<span class="fn">b</span> </span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">21</span>Look! The hand of My betrayer is with Mine on the table.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then they began to question among themselves which of them was going to do this.
</p><p class="hdg">Who Is the Greatest?</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>A dispute also arose among the disciples as to which of them would be considered the greatest.
<span class="reftext">25</span>So Jesus declared, <span>“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in authority over them call themselves benefactors.
<span class="reftext">26</span>But you shall not be like them. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.
<span class="reftext">27</span>For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as one who serves.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials.
<span class="reftext">29</span>And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father has bestowed one on Me,
<span class="reftext">30</span>so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:31–35; Mark 14:27–31; John 13:36–38)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat.
<span class="reftext">32</span>But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith will not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>“Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>But Jesus replied, <span>“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Then Jesus asked them, <span>“When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“Nothing,” they answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">36</span>“Now, however,”</span> He told them, <span>“the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.
<span class="reftext">37</span>For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors.’<span class="fn">c</span>  For what is written about Me is reaching its <span class='spell ca'>fulfillment</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfilment</span><span class='spell us'>fulfillment</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” </p><p class="reg1"><span>“That is enough,”</span> He answered.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:36–46; Mark 14:32–42)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed Him.
<span class="reftext">40</span>When He came to the place, He told them, <span>“Pray that you will not enter into temptation.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>And He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, where He knelt down and prayed,
<span class="reftext">42</span><span>“Father, if You are willing, take this cup from Me. Yet not My will, but Yours be done.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>Then an angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him.
<span class="reftext">44</span>And in His anguish, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>When Jesus rose from prayer and returned to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
<span><span class="reftext">46</span>“Why are you sleeping?”</span> He asked. <span>“Get up and pray so that you will not enter into temptation.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Betrayal of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:47–56; Mark 14:43–52; John 18:1–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>While He was still speaking, a crowd arrived, led by the man called Judas, one of the Twelve. He approached Jesus to kiss Him.
<span class="reftext">48</span>But Jesus asked him, <span>“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">49</span>Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”
<span class="reftext">50</span>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">51</span>But Jesus answered, <span>“No more of this!”</span> And He touched the man’s ear and healed him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">52</span>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple officers, and elders who had come for Him, <span>“Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against an outlaw?
<span class="reftext">53</span>Every day I was with you in the temple courts,<span class="fn">e</span>  and you did not lay a hand on Me. But this hour belongs to you and to the power of darkness.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Peter Denies Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:69–75; Mark 14:66–72; John 18:15–18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">54</span>Then they seized Jesus, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed at a distance.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">55</span>When those present had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.
<span class="reftext">56</span>A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked intently at him. “This man also was with Him,” she said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">57</span>But Peter denied it. “Woman, I do not know Him,” he said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">58</span>A short time later, someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” </p><p class="reg1"> But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">59</span>About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">60</span>“Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied. </p><p class="reg1"> While he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
<span class="reftext">61</span>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. </p><p class="reg1"> Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him: <span>“Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”</span>
<span class="reftext">62</span>And he went outside and wept bitterly.
</p><p class="hdg">The Soldiers Mock Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 50:4–11; Matthew 27:27–31; Mark 15:16–20; John 19:1–15)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">63</span>The men who were holding Jesus began to mock Him and beat Him.
<span class="reftext">64</span>They blindfolded Him<span class="fn">f</span>  and kept demanding, “Prophesy! Who hit You?”
<span class="reftext">65</span>And they said many other blasphemous things against Him.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus before the Sanhedrin<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:57–68; Mark 14:53–65; John 18:19–24)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">66</span>At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and scribes, met together. They led Jesus into their Sanhedrin<span class="fn">g</span>  and said,
<span class="reftext">67</span>“If You are the Christ, tell us.” </p><p class="reg1"> Jesus answered, <span>“If I tell you, you will not believe.
<span class="reftext">68</span>And if I ask you a question, you will not answer.
<span class="reftext">69</span>But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</span><span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">70</span>So they all asked, “Are You then the Son of God?” </p><p class="reg1"> He replied, <span>“You say that I am.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">71</span>“Why do we need any more testimony?” they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the feast of the Unleavened</i>; see Exodus 12:14–20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Some manuscripts end verse 19 after <i class="calibre6">This is My body</i> and do not include verse 20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">37</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Isaiah 53:12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">44</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Some manuscripts do not include verses 43 and 44.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">53</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">64</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">and were striking Him on the face</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">66</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">their Council</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">69</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> See Psalm 110:1.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
