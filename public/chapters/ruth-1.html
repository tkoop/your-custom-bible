<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Naomi Becomes a Widow<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Timothy 5:3–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. And a certain man from Bethlehem in Judah, with his wife and two sons, went to reside in the land of Moab.
<span class="reftext">2</span>The man’s name was Elimelech, his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah, and they entered the land of Moab and settled there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Naomi’s husband Elimelech died, and she was left with her two sons,
<span class="reftext">4</span>who took Moabite women as their wives, one named Orpah and the other named Ruth. </p><p class="reg1"> And after they had lived in Moab about ten years,
<span class="reftext">5</span>both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and without her husband.
</p><p class="hdg">Ruth’s Loyalty to Naomi</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>When Naomi heard in Moab that the LORD had attended to His people by providing them with food, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to leave the land of Moab.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Accompanied by her two daughters-in-law, she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road leading back to the land of Judah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you to your mother’s home. May the LORD show you loving devotion,<span class="fn">a</span>  as you have shown to your dead and to me.
<span class="reftext">9</span>May the LORD enable each of you to find rest in the home of your new husband.” </p><p class="reg1"> And she kissed them as they wept aloud
<span class="reftext">10</span>and said, “Surely we will return with you to your people.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But Naomi replied, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you go with me? Are there still sons in my womb to become your husbands?
<span class="reftext">12</span>Return home, my daughters. Go on, for I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons,
<span class="reftext">13</span>would you wait for them to grow up? Would you refrain from having husbands? No, my daughters, it grieves me very much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Again they wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; follow her back home.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But Ruth replied: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Do not urge me to leave you </p><p class="indent"> or to turn from following you. </p><p class="indent1"> For wherever you go, I will go, </p><p class="indent"> and wherever you live, I will live; </p><p class="indent1"> your people will be my people, </p><p class="indent"> and your God will be my God.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Where you die, I will die, </p><p class="indent"> and there I will be buried. </p><p class="indent1"> May the LORD punish me, </p><p class="indent"> and ever so severely, </p><p class="indent1"> if anything but death </p><p class="indent"> separates you and me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to persuade her.
</p><p class="hdg">The Return to Bethlehem</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So Naomi and Ruth traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole city was stirred because of them, and the women of the city exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>“Do not call me Naomi,<span class="fn">b</span>” she replied. “Call me Mara,<span class="fn">c</span>  because the Almighty<span class="fn">d</span>  has dealt quite bitterly with me.
<span class="reftext">21</span>I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? After all, the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So Naomi returned from the land of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess. And they arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">chesed</i> are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as <i class="calibre6">loving devotion</i>; the range of meaning includes <i class="calibre6">love</i>, <i class="calibre6">goodness</i>, <i class="calibre6">kindness</i>, <i class="calibre6">faithfulness</i>, and <i class="calibre6">mercy</i>, as well as <i class="calibre6">loyalty to a covenant</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Naomi</i> means <i class="calibre6">pleasant</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Mara</i> means <i class="calibre6">bitter</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Shaddai</i>; also in verse 21<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div>
