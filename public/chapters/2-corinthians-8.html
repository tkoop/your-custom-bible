<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Generosity Commended<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Philippians 4:10–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now, brothers, we want <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to know about the grace that God has given the churches of Macedonia.
<span class="reftext">2</span>In the terrible ordeal they suffered, their abundant joy and deep poverty overflowed into rich generosity.
<span class="reftext">3</span>For I testify that they gave according to their ability and even beyond it. Of their own accord,
<span class="reftext">4</span>they earnestly pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And not only did they do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, because it was the will of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So we urged Titus to help complete <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> act of grace, just as he had started it.
<span class="reftext">7</span>But just as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness, and in the love we inspired in <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span><span class="fn">a</span> —see that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> also excel in this grace of giving.
<span class="reftext">8</span>I am not making a demand, but I am testing the sincerity of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> love in comparison to the earnestness of others.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was rich, yet for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sakes <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> became poor, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> through <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> poverty might become rich.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And this is my opinion about what is helpful for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in this matter: Last year <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were the first not only to give, but even to have such a desire.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Now finish the work, so that you may complete it just as eagerly as you began, according to your means.
<span class="reftext">12</span>For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>It is not our intention that others may be relieved while <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are burdened, but that there may be equality.
<span class="reftext">14</span>At the present time, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> surplus will meet their need, so that in turn their surplus will meet <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> need. Then there will be equality.
<span class="reftext">15</span>As it is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">“He who gathered much had no excess, </p><p class="indent"> and he who gathered little had no shortfall.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Titus Commended<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Titus 1:1–4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same devotion I have for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For not only did he welcome our appeal, but he is eagerly coming to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> of his own volition.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Along with Titus we are sending the brother who is praised by all the churches for his work in the gospel.
<span class="reftext">19</span>More than that, this brother was chosen by the churches to accompany us with the offering<span class="fn">c</span> —the gracious gift we administer to <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> the Lord <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> and to show our eagerness to help.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>We hope to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this generous gift.
<span class="reftext">21</span>For we are taking great care to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And we are sending along with them our brother whose earnestness has been proven many times and in many ways, and now even more so by his great confidence in <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">23</span>As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. As for our brothers, they are messengers<span class="fn">d</span>  of the churches, to the glory of Christ.
<span class="reftext">24</span>In full view of the churches, then, show these men the proof of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> love and the reason for our boasting about <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in your love for us</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Exodus 16:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> See 1 Corinthians 16:3–4.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">apostles</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
