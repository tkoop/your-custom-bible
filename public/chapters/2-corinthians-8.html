<font ><b>Generosity Commended</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now, brothers, we want you to know about
the grace that God has given the churches of Macedonia. In the
terrible ordeal they suffered, their abundant joy and deep poverty
overflowed into rich generosity. For I testify that they gave
according to their ability and even beyond it. Of their own accord,
they earnestly pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this
service to the saints. And not only did they do as we expected, but
they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, because it was
the will of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So we urged Titus to help complete your
act of grace, just as he had started it. But just as you excel in
everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete
earnestness, and in the love we inspired in you —see that you also
excel in this grace of giving. I am not making a demand, but I am
testing the sincerity of your love in comparison to the earnestness
of others. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor,
so that you through His poverty might become rich. And this is my
opinion about what is helpful for you in this matter: Last year you
were the first not only to give, but even to have such a desire. Now
finish the work, so that you may complete it just as eagerly as you
began, according to your means. For if the eagerness is there, the
gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what
he does not have. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >It is not our intention that others may be
relieved while you are burdened, but that there may be equality. At
the present time, your surplus will meet their need, so that in turn
their surplus will meet your need. Then there will be equality. As it
is written: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >He who gathered much had no excess, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and he who gathered little had no
shortfall.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But thanks be to God, who put into the
heart of Titus the same devotion I have for you. For not only did he
welcome our appeal, but he is eagerly coming to you of his own
volition. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Along with Titus we are sending the
brother who is praised by all the churches for his work in the
gospel. More than that, this brother was chosen by the churches to
accompany us with the offering —the gracious gift we administer to
honor the Lord Himself and to show our eagerness to help. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We hope to avoid any criticism of the way
we administer this generous gift. For we are taking great care to do
what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes
of men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And we are sending along with them our
brother whose earnestness has been proven many times and in many
ways, and now even more so by his great confidence in you. As for
Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you. As for our
brothers, they are messengers of the churches, to the glory of
Christ. In full view of the churches, then, show these men the proof
of your love and the reason for our boasting about you. </font>
