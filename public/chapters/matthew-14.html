<span class="reftext">2</span>and said to his servants, “This is John the <span class='cap'>Baptist</span><span class='nocap'>baptist</span><span class='bsb'>Baptist</span>; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife,
<span class="reftext">4</span>because John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”
<span class="reftext">5</span>Although Herod wanted to kill John, he was afraid of the people, because they regarded John as a prophet.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>On Herod’s birthday, however, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod
<span class="reftext">7</span>so much that he promised with an oath to give to her whatever she asked.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the <span class='cap'>Baptist</span><span class='nocap'>baptist</span><span class='bsb'>Baptist</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The king was grieved, but because of his oaths and his guests, he ordered that her wish be granted
<span class="reftext">10</span>and sent to have John beheaded in the prison.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>John’s head was brought in on a platter and presented to the girl, who carried it to her mother.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. And they went and informed Jesus.

But the crowds found out about it and followed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> on foot from the towns.
<span class="reftext">14</span>When <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had compassion on them and healed their sick.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>When evening came, the disciples came to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late. Dismiss the crowds so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">16</span>“They do not need to go away,”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> give them something to eat.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>“We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">18</span>“Bring them here to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>,”</span> Jesus said.
<span class="reftext">19</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> directed the crowds to sit down on the grass.

Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
<span class="reftext">21</span>About five thousand men were fed, in addition to women and children.

<span class="reftext">23</span>After <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had sent them away, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> went up on the mountain by <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span><span class='bsb'>Himself</span> to pray. When evening came, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was there alone,
<span class="reftext">24</span>but the boat was already far<span class="fn">a</span>  from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>During the fourth watch of the night,<span class="fn">b</span>  Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea.
<span class="reftext">26</span>When the disciples saw <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said, and cried out in fear.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>But Jesus spoke up at once: <span>“Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>“Lord, if it is <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>,” Peter replied, “command me to come to <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> on the water.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">29</span>“Come,”</span> said Jesus. </p><p class="reg1"> Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.
<span class="reftext">30</span>But when he saw the strength of the wind,<span class="fn">c</span>  he was afraid, and beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Immediately Jesus reached out <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> hand and took hold of Peter. <span>“You of little faith,”</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said, <span>“why did you doubt?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>And when they had climbed back into the boat, the wind died down.
<span class="reftext">33</span>Then those who were in the boat worshiped <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, saying, “Truly <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> are the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of God!”
