<font ><b>The Beheading of John</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the
reports about Jesus and said to his servants, “This is John the
Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers
are at work in him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Herod had arrested John and bound him
and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s
wife, because John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you
to have her.” Although Herod wanted to kill John, he was afraid of
the people, because they regarded John as a prophet. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On Herod’s birthday, however, the
daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod so much
that he promised with an oath to give to her whatever she asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give
me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The king was grieved, but because of his
oaths and his guests, he ordered that her wish be granted and sent to
have John beheaded in the prison. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >John’s head was brought in on a platter
and presented to the girl, who carried it to her mother. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then John’s disciples came and took his
body and buried it. And they went and informed Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus heard about John, He withdrew
by boat privately to a solitary place. But the crowds found out about
it and followed Him on foot from the towns. When He stepped ashore
and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them and healed their
sick. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When evening came, the disciples came to
Him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already
late. Dismiss the crowds so they can go to the villages and buy
themselves some food.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >They do not need
to go away,”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“You
give them something to eat.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >We have here only five loaves of bread
and two fish,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Bring them here
to Me,”</font> Jesus said. And He directed the crowds to sit down
on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up
to heaven, He spoke a blessing. Then He broke the loaves and gave
them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They all ate and were satisfied, and the
disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left
over. About five thousand men were fed, in addition to women and
children. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Immediately Jesus made the disciples get
into the boat and go on ahead of Him to the other side, while He
dismissed the crowds. After He had sent them away, He went up on the
mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone,
but the boat was already far from land, buffeted by the waves because
the wind was against it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >During the fourth watch of the night,
Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea. When the disciples saw
Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!”
they said, and cried out in fear. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus spoke up at once: <font color="#a80000">“Take
courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Lord, if it is You,” Peter replied,
“command me to come to You on the water.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Come,”</font>
said Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Peter got down out of the boat,
walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the
strength of the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, cried
out, “Lord, save me!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Immediately Jesus reached out His hand and
took hold of Peter. <font color="#a80000">“You of little faith,”</font>
He said, <font color="#a80000">“why did you doubt?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when they had climbed back into the
boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshiped
Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they had crossed over, they landed at
Gennesaret. And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they
sent word to all the surrounding region. People brought all the sick
to Him and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak.
And all who touched Him were healed. </font>
