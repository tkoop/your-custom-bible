<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Command to Leave Sinai<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 1:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses, “Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of the land of Egypt, and go to the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’
<span class="reftext">2</span>And I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people; otherwise, I might destroy you on the way.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When the people heard these bad tidings, they went into mourning, and no one put on any of his <span class='spell ca'>jewellery</span><span class='spell gb'>jewellery</span><span class='spell us'>jewelry</span>.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are a stiff-necked people. If I should go with you for a single moment, I would destroy you. Now take off your <span class='spell ca'>jewellery</span><span class='spell gb'>jewellery</span><span class='spell us'>jewelry</span>, and I will decide what to do with you.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So the Israelites stripped themselves of their <span class='spell ca'>jewellery</span><span class='spell gb'>jewellery</span><span class='spell us'>jewelry</span> from Mount Horeb onward.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Tent of Meeting</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it at a distance outside the camp. He called it the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span><span class='bsb'>Tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span><span class='bsb'>Meeting</span>, and anyone inquiring of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> would go to the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span><span class='bsb'>Tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span><span class='bsb'>Meeting</span> outside the camp.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Then, whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would stand at the entrances to their own tents and watch Moses until he entered the tent.
<span class="reftext">9</span>As Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and remain at the entrance, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> would speak with Moses.
<span class="reftext">10</span>When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they would stand up and worship, each one at the entrance to his own tent.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Thus <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young assistant Joshua son of Nun would not leave the tent.
</p><p class="hdg">The Promise of God’s Presence</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Moses said to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “Look, <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> have been telling me, ‘Lead this people up,’ but <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> have not let me know whom <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> will send with me. Yet <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> sight.’
<span class="reftext">13</span>Now if indeed I have found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> sight, please let me know <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> ways, that I may know <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> and find <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> sight. Remember that this nation is <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> people.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> answered, “My <span class='cap'>Presence</span><span class='nocap'>presence</span><span class='bsb'>Presence</span> will go with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and I will give you rest.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>“If <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> <span class='cap'>Presence</span><span class='nocap'>presence</span><span class='bsb'>Presence</span> does not go with us,” Moses replied, “do not lead us up from here.
<span class="reftext">16</span>For how then can it be known that <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> people and I have found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> sight, unless <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> go with us? How else will we be distinguished from all the other people on the face of the earth?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses, “I will do this very thing you have asked, for you have found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> sight, and I know you by name.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then Moses said, “Please show me <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> glory.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>“I will cause all <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> goodness to pass before you,” <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> replied, “and I will proclaim <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> name—<span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>—in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>But <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> added, “You cannot see <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> face, for no one can see <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> and live.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> continued, “There is a place near <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> where you are to stand upon a rock,

<span class="reftext">23</span>Then I will take <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> hand away, and you will see <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> back; but <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> face must not be seen.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, from Mount Sinai onward, or possibly a mountain in the range containing Mount Sinai<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Cited in Romans 9:15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
