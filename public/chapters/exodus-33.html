<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Leave this
place, you and the people you brought up out of the land of Egypt,
and go to the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when
I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ And I will send an
angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites,
Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. Go up to a land flowing
with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a
stiff-necked people; otherwise, I might destroy you on the way.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the people heard these bad tidings,
they went into mourning, and no one put on any of his jewelry. For
the LORD had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a
stiff-necked people. If I should go with you for a single moment, I
would destroy you. Now take off your jewelry, and I will decide what
to do with you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the Israelites stripped themselves of
their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch
it at a distance outside the camp. He called it the Tent of Meeting,
and anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the Tent of Meeting
outside the camp. Then, whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the
people would stand at the entrances to their own tents and watch
Moses until he entered the tent. As Moses entered the tent, the
pillar of cloud would come down and remain at the entrance, and the
LORD would speak with Moses. When all the people saw the pillar of
cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they would stand up and
worship, each one at the entrance to his own tent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Thus the LORD would speak to Moses face to
face, as a man speaks to his friend. Then Moses would return to the
camp, but his young assistant Joshua son of Nun would not leave the
tent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Moses said to the LORD, “Look, You
have been telling me, ‘Lead this people up,’ but You have not let
me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, ‘I know you
by name, and you have found favor in My sight.’ Now if indeed I
have found favor in Your sight, please let me know Your ways, that I
may know You and find favor in Your sight. Remember that this nation
is Your people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD answered, “My Presence will
go with you, and I will give you rest.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">If Your Presence does not go with us,”
Moses replied, “do not lead us up from here. For how then can it be
known that Your people and I have found favor in Your sight, unless
You go with us? How else will we be distinguished from all the other
people on the face of the earth?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the LORD said to Moses, “I will do
this very thing you have asked, for you have found favor in My sight,
and I know you by name.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Moses said, “Please show me Your
glory.” </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will cause all My goodness to pass
before you,” the LORD replied, “and I will proclaim My name—the
LORD—in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and
I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But He added, “You cannot see My face,
for no one can see Me and live.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD continued, “There is a place
near Me where you are to stand upon a rock, and when My glory passes
by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and cover you with My hand
until I have passed by. Then I will take My hand away, and you will
see My back; but My face must not be seen.” </font>
