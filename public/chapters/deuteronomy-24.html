<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Marriage and Divorce Laws<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 5:31–32; Luke 16:18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>If a man marries a woman, but she becomes displeasing to him because he finds some indecency in her, he may write her a certificate of divorce,<span class="fn">a</span>  hand it to her, and send her away from his house.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>If, after leaving his house, she goes and becomes another man’s wife,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and the second man hates her, writes her a certificate of divorce, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house, or if he dies,
<span class="reftext">4</span>then the husband who divorced her first may not remarry her after she has been defiled, for that is an abomination to the LORD. You must not bring sin upon the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>If a man is newly married, he must not be sent to war or be pressed into any duty. For one year he is free to stay at home and bring joy to the wife he has married.
</p><p class="hdg">Additional Laws</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Do not take a pair of millstones or even an upper millstone as security for a debt, because that would be taking one’s livelihood as security.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>If a man is caught kidnapping one of his Israelite brothers, whether he treats him as a slave or sells him, the kidnapper must die. So you must purge the evil from among you.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>In cases of infectious skin diseases,<span class="fn">c</span>  be careful to diligently follow everything the Levitical priests instruct you. Be careful to do as I have commanded them.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the journey after you came out of Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>When you lend anything to your neighbor, do not enter his house to collect security.
<span class="reftext">11</span>You are to stand outside while the man to whom you are lending brings the security out to you.
<span class="reftext">12</span>If he is a poor man, you must not go to sleep with the security in your possession;
<span class="reftext">13</span>be sure to return it to him by sunset, so that he may sleep in his own cloak and bless you, and this will be credited to you as righteousness before the LORD your God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Do not oppress a hired hand who is poor and needy, whether he is a brother or a foreigner residing in one of your towns.
<span class="reftext">15</span>You are to pay his wages each day before sunset, because he is poor and depends on them. Otherwise he may cry out to the LORD against you, and you will be guilty of sin.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Do not deny justice to the foreigner or the fatherless, and do not take a widow’s cloak as security.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you from that place. Therefore I am commanding you to do this.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>If you are harvesting in your field and forget a sheaf there, do not go back to get it. It is to be left for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>When you beat the olives from your trees, you must not go over the branches again. What remains will be for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you must not go over the vines again. What remains will be for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt. Therefore I am commanding you to do this.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in Matthew 5:31; see also Mark 10:4.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Cited in 1 Corinthians 5:13<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">tzaraath</i>, traditionally translated as <i class="calibre6">leprosy</i>, were used for various skin diseases; see Leviticus 13.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Cited in 2 Kings 14:6 and 2 Chronicles 25:4<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
