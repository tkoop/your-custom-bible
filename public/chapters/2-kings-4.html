<font ><b>The Widow’s Oil</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the wife of one of the sons of the
prophets cried out to Elisha, “Your servant, my husband, is dead,
and you know that your servant feared the LORD. And now his creditor
is coming to take my two children as his slaves!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >How can I help you?” asked Elisha.
“Tell me, what do you have in the house?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >She answered, “Your servant has nothing
in the house but a jar of oil.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Go,” said Elisha, “borrow jars,
even empty ones, from all your neighbors. Do not gather just a few.
Then go inside, shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour oil
into all these jars, setting the full ones aside.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So she left him, and after she had shut
the door behind her and her sons, they kept bringing jars to her, and
she kept pouring. When all the jars were full, she said to her son,
“Bring me another.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But he replied, “There are no more
jars.” Then the oil stopped flowing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >She went and told the man of God, and he
said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt. Then you and your sons
can live on the remainder.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One day Elisha went to Shunem, and a
prominent woman who lived there persuaded him to have a meal. So
whenever he would pass by, he would stop there to eat. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the woman said to her husband,
“Behold, now I know that the one who often comes our way is a holy
man of God. Please let us make a small room upstairs and put in it a
bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp for him. Then when he comes to us,
he can stay there.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One day Elisha came to visit and went to
his upper room to lie down. And he said to Gehazi his servant, “Call
the Shunammite woman.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when he had called her, she stood
before him, and Elisha said to Gehazi, “Now tell her, ‘Look, you
have gone to all this trouble for us. What can we do for you? Can we
speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I have a home among my own people,”
she replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he asked, “Then what should be done
for her?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Well, she has no son,” Gehazi
replied, “and her husband is old.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Call her,” said Elisha. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Gehazi called her, and she stood in the
doorway. And Elisha declared, “At this time next year, you will
hold a son in your arms.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >No, my lord,” she said. “Do not lie
to your maidservant, O man of God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the woman did conceive, and at that
time the next year she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told
her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the child grew, and one day he went
out to his father, who was with the harvesters. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >My head! My head!” he complained to
his father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So his father told a servant, “Carry him
to his mother.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After the servant had picked him up and
carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and
then he died. And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of
God. Then she shut the door and went out. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the woman called her husband and said,
“Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, that I
may go quickly to the man of God and return.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Why would you go to him today?” he
replied. “It is not a New Moon or a Sabbath.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Everything is all right,” she said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then she saddled the donkey and told her
servant, “Drive onward; do not slow the pace for me unless I tell
you.” So she set out and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the man of God saw her at a distance,
he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, there is the Shunammite
woman. Please run out now to meet her and ask, ‘Are you all right?
Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And she answered, “Everything is all
right.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When she reached the man of God at the
mountain, she clung to his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away,
but the man of God said, “Leave her alone, for her soul is in deep
distress, and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then she said, “Did I ask you for a son,
my lord? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not deceive me?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tie up your
garment, take my staff in your hand, and go! If you meet anyone, do
not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer him. Then lay
my staff on the boy’s face.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the mother of the boy said, “As
surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave
you.” So he got up and followed her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Gehazi went on ahead of them and laid the
staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or response. So he
went back to meet Elisha and told him, “The boy has not awakened.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Elisha reached the house, there was
the boy lying dead on his bed. So he went in, closed the door behind
the two of them, and prayed to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Elisha got on the bed and lay on the
boy, mouth to mouth, eye to eye, and hand to hand. As he stretched
himself out over him, the boy’s body became warm. Elisha turned
away and paced back and forth across the room. Then he got on the bed
and stretched himself out over the boy again, and the boy sneezed
seven times and opened his eyes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, “Call
the Shunammite woman.” So he called her and she came. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Elisha said, “Pick up your son.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >She came in, fell at his feet, and bowed
to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was
a famine in the land. As the sons of the prophets were sitting at his
feet, he said to his attendant, “Put on the large pot and boil some
stew for the sons of the prophets.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One of them went out to the field to
gather herbs, and he found a wild vine from which he gathered as many
wild gourds as his garment could hold. Then he came back and cut them
up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And they poured it out for the men to eat,
but when they tasted the stew they cried out, “There is death in
the pot, O man of God!” And they could not eat it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Elisha said, “Get some flour.” He
threw it into the pot and said, “Pour it out for the people to
eat.” And there was nothing harmful in the pot. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now a man from Baal-shalishah came to the
man of God with a sack of twenty loaves of barley bread from the
first ripe grain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Give it to the people to eat,” said
Elisha. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But his servant asked, “How am I to set
twenty loaves before a hundred men?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Give it to the people to eat,” said
Elisha, “for this is what the LORD says: ‘They will eat and have
some left over.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he set it before them, and they ate and
had some left over, according to the word of the LORD. </font>
