<font face="Tahoma, serif">So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s
reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his entire army. They encamped
outside the city and built a siege wall all around it. And the city
was kept under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">By the ninth day of the fourth month, the
famine in the city was so severe that the people of the land had no
food. Then the city was breached; and though the Chaldeans had
surrounded the city, all the men of war fled the city by night by way
of the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Chaldeans seized the king and brought

<font face="Tahoma, serif">There at Riblah the king of Babylon
slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also killed

<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the tenth day of the fifth month, in
the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign over Babylon,
Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon,
entered Jerusalem. He burned down the house of the LORD, the royal
palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem—every significant building.
And the whole army of the Chaldeans under the captain of the guard
broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Nebuzaradan captain of the guard
carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained
in the city, along with the deserters who had defected to the king of
Babylon and the rest of the craftsmen. But Nebuzaradan captain of the
guard left behind some of the poorest of the land to tend the
vineyards and fields. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moreover, the Chaldeans broke up the
bronze pillars and stands and the bronze Sea in the house of the
LORD, and they carried all the bronze to Babylon. They also took away
the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes, and all
the articles of bronze used in the temple service. The captain of the
guard also took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots,
lampstands, pans, and drink offering bowls—anything made of pure
gold or fine silver. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">As for the two pillars, the Sea, the
twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands that King
Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the weight of the bronze
from all these articles was beyond measure. Each pillar was eighteen
cubits tall and twelve cubits in circumference; each was hollow, four
fingers thick. The bronze capital atop one pillar was five cubits
high, with a network of bronze pomegranates all around. The second
pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar. Each capital had
ninety-six pomegranates on the sides, and a total of a hundred
pomegranates were above the surrounding network. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The captain of the guard also took away
Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of second rank, and
the three doorkeepers. Of those still in the city, he took a court
official who had been appointed over the men of war, as well as seven
trusted royal advisers. He also took the scribe of the captain of the
army, who had enlisted the people of the land, and sixty men who were
found in the city. </font>
