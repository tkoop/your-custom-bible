</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, </p><p class="indent"> our houses to foreigners.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>We have become fatherless orphans; </p><p class="indent"> our mothers are widows.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>We must buy the water we drink; </p><p class="indent"> our wood comes at a price.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>We are closely pursued; </p><p class="indent"> we are weary and find no rest.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>We submitted to Egypt and Assyria </p><p class="indent"> to get enough bread.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Our fathers sinned and are no more, </p><p class="indent"> but we bear their punishment.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Slaves rule over us; </p><p class="indent"> there is no one to deliver us from their hands.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>We get our bread at the risk of our lives </p><p class="indent"> because of the sword in the wilderness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Our skin is as hot as an oven </p><p class="indent"> with fever from our hunger.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>Women have been ravished in Zion, </p><p class="indent"> virgins in the cities of Judah.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Princes have been hung up by their hands; </p><p class="indent"> elders receive no respect.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Young men toil at millstones; </p><p class="indent"> boys stagger under loads of wood.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The elders have left the city gate; </p><p class="indent"> the young men have stopped their music.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Joy has left our hearts; </p><p class="indent"> our dancing has turned to mourning.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>The crown has fallen from our head. </p><p class="indent"> Woe to us, for we have sinned!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>Because of this, our hearts are faint; </p><p class="indent"> because of these, our eyes grow dim—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate, </p><p class="indent"> patrolled by foxes.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>You, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, reign forever; </p><p class="indent"> Your throne endures from generation to generation.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Why have <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> forgotten us forever? </p><p class="indent"> Why have <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> forsaken us for so long?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Restore us to <span class='cap'>Yourself</span><span class='nocap'>yourself</span>, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, so we may return; </p><p class="indent"> renew our days as of old,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>unless <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have utterly rejected us </p><p class="indent"> and remain angry with us beyond measure.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
