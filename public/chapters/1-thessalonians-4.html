<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Finally, brothers, we ask and encourage
you in the Lord Jesus to live in a way that is pleasing to God, just
as you have received from us. This is how you already live, so you
should do so all the more. For you know the instructions we gave you
by the authority of the Lord Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For it is Godâ€™s will that you should be
holy: You must abstain from sexual immorality; each of you must know
how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in lustful
passion like the Gentiles who do not know God; and no one should ever
violate or exploit his brother in this regard, because the Lord will
avenge all such acts, as we have already told you and solemnly warned
you. For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness. Anyone,
then, who rejects this command does not reject man but God, the very
One who gives you His Holy Spirit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now about brotherly love, you do not need
anyone to write to you, because you yourselves have been taught by
God to love one another. And you are indeed showing this love to all
the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to
excel more and more and to aspire to live quietly, to attend to your
own matters, and to work with your own hands, as we instructed you.
Then you will behave properly toward outsiders, without being
dependent on anyone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Brothers, we do not want you to be
uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you will not
grieve like the rest, who are without hope. For since we believe that
Jesus died and rose again, we also believe that God will bring with
Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >By the word of the Lord, we declare to you
that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by
no means precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself
will descend from heaven with a loud command, with the voice of an
archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will
be the first to rise. After that, we who are alive and remain will be
caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the
air. And so we will always be with the Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore encourage one another with these
words. </font>
