<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Living to Please God</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Finally, brothers, we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus to live in a way that is pleasing to God, just as you have received from us. This is how you already live, so you should do so all the more.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For you know the instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For it is God’s will that you should be holy: You must abstain from sexual immorality;
<span class="reftext">4</span>each of you must know how to control his own body<span class="fn">a</span>  in holiness and honour,
<span class="reftext">5</span>not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God;
<span class="reftext">6</span>and no one should ever violate or exploit his brother in this regard,<span class="fn">b</span>  because the Lord will avenge all such acts, as we have already told you and solemnly warned you.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Anyone, then, who rejects this command does not reject man but God, the very One who gives you His Holy Spirit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Now about brotherly love, you do not need anyone to write to you, because you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And you are indeed showing this love to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to excel more and more
<span class="reftext">11</span>and to aspire to live quietly, to attend to your own matters, and to work with your own hands, as we instructed you.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then you will behave properly toward outsiders, without being dependent on anyone.
</p><p class="hdg">The Return of the Lord</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Brothers, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death,<span class="fn">c</span>  so that you will not grieve like the rest, who are without hope.
<span class="reftext">14</span>For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, we also believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>By the word of the Lord, we declare to you that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who have fallen asleep.
<span class="reftext">16</span>For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a loud command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will be the first to rise.
<span class="reftext">17</span>After that, we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will always be with the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Therefore encourage one another with these words.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">know how to possess his own vessel</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">no one should ever harm or cheat his brother in this matter</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">those who have fallen asleep</i>, as in verses 14 and 15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
