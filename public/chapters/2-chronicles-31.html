<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Destruction of Idols</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When all this had ended, the Israelites in attendance went out to the cities of Judah and broke up the sacred pillars, chopped down the Asherah poles, and tore down the high places and altars throughout Judah and Benjamin, as well as in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the Israelites returned to their cities, each to his own property.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Hezekiah reestablished the divisions of the priests and Levites—each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites—for the burnt offerings and peace offerings, for ministry, for giving thanks, and for singing praises at the gates of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s dwelling.
</p><p class="hdg">Contributions for Worship</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>The king contributed from his own possessions for the regular morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts, as written in the Law of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Moreover, he commanded the people living in Jerusalem to make a contribution for the priests and Levites so that they could devote themselves to the Law of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously provided the firstfruits of the grain, new wine, oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field, and they brought in an abundance—a tithe of everything.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the Israelites and Judahites who lived in the cities of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things consecrated to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> their God, and they laid them in large heaps.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>In the third month they began building up the heaps, and they finished in the seventh month.
<span class="reftext">8</span>When Hezekiah and his officials came and viewed the heaps, they blessed <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and His people Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and Levites about the heaps,
<span class="reftext">10</span>and Azariah, the chief priest of the household of Zadok, answered him, “Since the people began to bring their contributions into the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, we have had enough to eat and there is plenty left over, because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has blessed His people; this great abundance is what is left over.”
</p><p class="hdg">Hezekiah Organizes the Priests</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare storerooms in the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and they did so.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes, and dedicated gifts. Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them, and his brother Shimei was second.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the authority of Conaniah and his brother Shimei, by appointment of King Hezekiah and of Azariah the chief official of the house of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and the consecrated gifts.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Under his authority, Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah faithfully distributed portions to their fellow priests in their cities, according to their divisions, old and young alike.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>In addition, they distributed portions to the males registered by genealogy who were three years of age or older—to all who would enter the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> for their daily duties for service in the responsibilities of their divisions—
<span class="reftext">17</span>and to the priests enrolled according to their families in the genealogy, as well as to the Levites twenty years of age or older, according to their duties and divisions.
<span class="reftext">18</span>The genealogy included all the little ones, wives, sons, and daughters in the whole assembly. For they had faithfully consecrated themselves as holy.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farmlands around each of their cities or in any other city, men were designated by name to distribute a portion to every male among the priests and to every Levite listed by the genealogies.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So this is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He did what was good and upright and true before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> his God.
<span class="reftext">21</span>He was diligent in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law and the commandments, in order to seek his God. And so he prospered.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">whether large or small</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
