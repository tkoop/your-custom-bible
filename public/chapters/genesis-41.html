<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Joseph Interprets Pharaoh’s Dreams</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After two full years had passed, Pharaoh
had a dream: He was standing beside the Nile, when seven cows, sleek
and well-fed, came up from the river and began to graze among the
reeds. After them, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came up from
the Nile and stood beside the well-fed cows on the bank of the river.
And the cows that were sickly and thin devoured the seven sleek,
well-fed cows. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Pharaoh woke up, but he fell back
asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven heads of grain, plump and
ripe, came up on one stalk. After them, seven other heads of grain
sprouted, thin and scorched by the east wind. And the thin heads of
grain swallowed up the seven plump, ripe ones. Then Pharaoh awoke and
realized it was a dream. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the morning his spirit was troubled, so
he summoned all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told
them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh,
“Today I recall my failures. Pharaoh was once angry with his
servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the
captain of the guard. One night both the chief baker and I had
dreams, and each dream had its own meaning. Now a young Hebrew was
there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our
dreams and he interpreted them for us individually. And it happened
to us just as he had interpreted: I was restored to my position, and
the other man was hanged.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, who was
quickly brought out of the dungeon. After he had shaved and changed
his clothes, he went in before Pharaoh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream,
and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that
when you hear a dream you can interpret it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I myself cannot do it,” Joseph
replied, “but God will give Pharaoh a sound answer.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “In my
dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, when seven cows,
well-fed and sleek, came up from the river and began to graze among
the reeds. After them, seven other cows—sickly, ugly, and thin—came
up. I have never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt! Then
the thin, ugly cows devoured the seven well-fed cows that were there
first. When they had devoured them, however, no one could tell that
they had done so; their appearance was as ugly as it had been before.
Then I awoke. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In my dream I also saw seven heads of
grain, plump and ripe, growing on a single stalk. After them, seven
other heads of grain sprouted—withered, thin, and scorched by the
east wind. And the thin heads of grain swallowed the seven plump
ones. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I told this dream to the magicians, but no
one could explain it to me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At this, Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The
dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh
what He is about to do. The seven good cows are seven years, and the
seven ripe heads of grain are seven years. The dreams have the same
meaning. Moreover, the seven thin, ugly cows that came up after them
are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain
scorched by the east wind—they are seven years of famine. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has
shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. Behold, seven years of great
abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt, but seven years of
famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in the land of Egypt
will be forgotten, and the famine will devastate the land. The
abundance in the land will not be remembered, since the famine that
follows it will be so severe. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moreover, because the dream was given to
Pharaoh in two versions, the matter has been decreed by God, and He
will carry it out shortly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now, therefore, Pharaoh should look for a
discerning and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt. Let
Pharaoh take action and appoint commissioners over the land to take a
fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
Under the authority of Pharaoh, let them collect all the excess food
from these good years, that they may come and lay up the grain to be
preserved as food in the cities. This food will be a reserve for the
land during the seven years of famine to come upon the land of Egypt.
Then the country will not perish in the famine.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his
officials. So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this
man, in whom the Spirit of God abides?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God
has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and
wise as you. You shall be in charge of my house, and all my people
are to obey your commands. Only with regard to the throne will I be
greater than you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Pharaoh also told Joseph, “I hereby
place you over all the land of Egypt.” Then Pharaoh removed the
signet ring from his finger, put it on Joseph’s finger, clothed him
in garments of fine linen, and placed a gold chain around his neck.
He had Joseph ride in his second chariot, with men calling out before
him, “Bow the knee!” So he placed him over all the land of Egypt.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Pharaoh declared to Joseph, “I am
Pharaoh, but without your permission, no one in all the land of Egypt
shall lift his hand or foot.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Pharaoh gave Joseph the name
Zaphenath-paneah, and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera,
priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph took charge of all the land
of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Joseph was thirty years old when he
entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph left
Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout the land of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">During the seven years of abundance, the
land brought forth bountifully. During those seven years, Joseph
collected all the excess food in the land of Egypt and stored it in
the cities. In every city he laid up the food from the fields around
it. So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance, like the sand of the
sea, that he stopped keeping track of it; for it was beyond measure. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Before the years of famine arrived, two
sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of
On. Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh, saying, “God has made me
forget all my hardship and all my father’s household.” And the
second son he named Ephraim, saying, “God has made me fruitful in
the land of my affliction.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the seven years of abundance in the
land of Egypt came to an end, the seven years of famine began, just
as Joseph had said. And although there was famine in every country,
there was food throughout the land of Egypt. When extreme hunger came
to all the land of Egypt and the people cried out to Pharaoh for
food, he told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do whatever he
tells you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the famine had spread over all the
land, Joseph opened up all the storehouses and sold grain to the
Egyptians; for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. And every
nation came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was
severe over all the earth. </font>
