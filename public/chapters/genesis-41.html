<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Dreams of Pharaoh</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing beside the Nile,
<span class="reftext">2</span>when seven cows, sleek and well-fed, came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds.
<span class="reftext">3</span>After them, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came up from the Nile and stood beside the well-fed cows on the bank of the river.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the cows that were sickly and thin devoured the seven sleek, well-fed cows. </p><p class="reg1"> Then Pharaoh woke up,
<span class="reftext">5</span>but he fell back asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, came up on one stalk.
<span class="reftext">6</span>After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted, thin and scorched by the east wind.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven plump, ripe ones. Then Pharaoh awoke and realized it was a dream.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>In the morning his spirit was troubled, so he summoned all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I recall my failures.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guard.
<span class="reftext">11</span>One night both the chief baker and I had dreams, and each dream had its own meaning.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams and he interpreted them for us individually.
<span class="reftext">13</span>And it happened to us just as he had interpreted: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged.”
</p><p class="hdg">Joseph Interprets Pharaoh’s Dreams</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, who was quickly brought out of the dungeon. After he had shaved and changed his clothes, he went in before Pharaoh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>“I myself cannot do it,” Joseph replied, “but God will give Pharaoh a sound answer.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph: “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,
<span class="reftext">18</span>when seven cows, well-fed and sleek, came up from the river and began to graze among the reeds.
<span class="reftext">19</span>After them, seven other cows—sickly, ugly, and thin—came up. I have never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt!
<span class="reftext">20</span>Then the thin, ugly cows devoured the seven well-fed cows that were there first.
<span class="reftext">21</span>When they had devoured them, however, no one could tell that they had done so; their appearance was as ugly as it had been before. Then I awoke.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>In my dream I also saw seven heads of grain, plump and ripe, growing on a single stalk.
<span class="reftext">23</span>After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And the thin heads of grain swallowed the seven plump ones. </p><p class="reg1"> I told this dream to the magicians, but no one could explain it to me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>At this, Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what He is about to do.
<span class="reftext">26</span>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven ripe heads of grain are seven years. The dreams have the same meaning.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Moreover, the seven thin, ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind—they are seven years of famine.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,
<span class="reftext">30</span>but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will devastate the land.
<span class="reftext">31</span>The abundance in the land will not be remembered, since the famine that follows it will be so severe.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Moreover, because the dream was given to Pharaoh in two versions, the matter has been decreed by God, and He will carry it out shortly.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Now, therefore, Pharaoh should look for a discerning and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">34</span>Let Pharaoh take action and appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest<span class="fn">a</span>  of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
<span class="reftext">35</span>Under the authority of Pharaoh, let them collect all the excess food from these good years, that they may come and lay up the grain to be preserved as food in the cities.
<span class="reftext">36</span>This food will be a reserve for the land during the seven years of famine to come upon the land of Egypt. Then the country will not perish in the famine.”
</p><p class="hdg">Joseph Given Charge of Egypt</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>This proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his officials.
<span class="reftext">38</span>So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, in whom the Spirit of God<span class="fn">b</span>  abides?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you.
<span class="reftext">40</span>You shall be in charge of my house, and all my people are to obey your commands. Only with regard to the throne will I be greater than you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>Pharaoh also told Joseph, “I hereby place you over all the land of Egypt.”
<span class="reftext">42</span>Then Pharaoh removed the signet ring from his finger, put it on Joseph’s finger, clothed him in garments of fine linen, and placed a gold chain around his neck.
<span class="reftext">43</span>He had Joseph ride in his second chariot, with men calling out before him, “Bow the knee!”<span class="fn">c</span>  So he placed him over all the land of Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>And Pharaoh declared to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, but without your permission, no one in all the land of Egypt shall lift his hand or foot.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah,<span class="fn">d</span>  and he gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On,<span class="fn">e</span>  to be his wife. And Joseph took charge of all the land of Egypt.
</p><p class="hdg">The Seven Years of Plenty</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>Now Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence and travelled throughout the land of Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>During the seven years of abundance, the land brought forth bountifully.
<span class="reftext">48</span>During those seven years, Joseph collected all the excess food in the land of Egypt and stored it in the cities. In every city he laid up the food from the fields around it.
<span class="reftext">49</span>So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance, like the sand of the sea, that he stopped keeping track of it; for it was beyond measure.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>Before the years of famine arrived, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
<span class="reftext">51</span>Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh,<span class="fn">f</span>  saying, “God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father’s household.”
<span class="reftext">52</span>And the second son he named Ephraim,<span class="fn">g</span>  saying, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Famine Begins</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">53</span>When the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end,
<span class="reftext">54</span>the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. And although there was famine in every country, there was food throughout the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">55</span>When extreme hunger came to all the land of Egypt and the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, he told all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">56</span>When the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened up all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians; for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">57</span>And every nation came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">34</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> See LXX; MT <i class="calibre6">a fifth from the land</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">38</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the spirit of the gods</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">43</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, <i class="calibre6">“Abrek,”</i> probably an Egyptian word that sounds similar to the Hebrew for <i class="calibre6">kneel</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">45</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Zaphenath-paneah</i> probably means <i class="calibre6">Revealer of Mysteries</i> or <i class="calibre6">God speaks and lives</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">45</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, Heliopolis, as in LXX; also in verse 50<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">51</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">Manasseh</i> sounds like the Hebrew for <i class="calibre6">making to forget</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">52</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">Ephraim</i> sounds like the Hebrew for <i class="calibre6">making fruitful</i> or <i class="calibre6">twice fruitful</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
