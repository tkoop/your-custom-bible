<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Ahab’s Seventy Sons Killed</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the officials of Jezreel,<span class="fn">a</span>  to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons<span class="fn">b</span>  of Ahab, saying:
<span class="reftext">2</span>“When this letter arrives, since <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> master’s sons are with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weaponry,
<span class="reftext">3</span>select the best and most worthy son of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> master, set him on his father’s throne, and fight for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> master’s house.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But they were terrified and reasoned, “If two kings could not stand against him, how can we?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So the palace administrator, the overseer of the city, the elders, and the guardians sent a message to Jehu: “We are your servants, and we will do whatever you say. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your sight.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then Jehu wrote them a second letter and said: “If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are on my side, and if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will obey me, then bring the heads of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> master’s sons to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.” </p><p class="reg1"> Now the sons of the king, seventy in all, were being brought up by the leading men of the city.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And when the letter arrived, they took the sons of the king and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the sons of the king.” </p><p class="reg1"> And Jehu ordered, “Pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The next morning, Jehu went out and stood before all the people and said, “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all these?
<span class="reftext">10</span>Know, then, that not a word <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has done what <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> promised through <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> servant Elijah.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his great men and close friends and priests, leaving him without a single survivor.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Jehu set out toward Samaria. At Beth-eked of the <span class='cap'>Shepherds</span><span class='nocap'>shepherds</span>,
<span class="reftext">13</span>Jehu met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, “Who are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>?” </p><p class="reg1">“We are relatives of Ahaziah,” they answered, “and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and of the queen mother.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then Jehu ordered, “Take them alive.” So his men took them alive, then slaughtered them at the well of Beth-eked—forty-two men. He spared none of them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>When he left there, he found Jehonadab son of Rechab, who was coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and asked, “Is your heart as true to mine as my heart is to yours?” </p><p class="reg1">“It is!” Jehonadab replied. </p><p class="reg1"> “If it is,” said Jehu, “give me your hand.” </p><p class="reg1"> So he gave him his hand, and Jehu helped him into his chariot,
<span class="reftext">16</span>saying, “Come with me and see my zeal for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>!” So he had him ride<span class="fn">c</span>  in his chariot.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>When Jehu came to Samaria, he struck down everyone belonging to Ahab who remained there, until he had destroyed them, according to the word that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had spoken to Elijah.
</p><p class="hdg">Jehu Kills the Priests of Baal</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then Jehu brought all the people together and said, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him a lot.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Now, therefore, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests. See that no one is missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever is missing will not live.” </p><p class="reg1"> But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Jehu commanded, “Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal.” So they announced it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then Jehu sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; there was not a man who failed to show. They entered the temple of Baal, and it was filled from end to end.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, “Bring out garments for all the servants of Baal.” So he brought out garments for them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Next, Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rechab entered the temple of Baal, and Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Look around to see that there are no servants of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> here among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>—only servants of Baal.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>And they went in<span class="fn">d</span>  to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside and warned them, “If anyone allows one of the men I am delivering into <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hands to escape, he will forfeit his life for theirs.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>When he had finished making the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and officers, “Go in and kill them. Do not let anyone out.” </p><p class="reg1"> So the guards and officers put them to the sword, threw the bodies out, and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>They brought out the sacred pillar of the temple of Baal and burned it.
<span class="reftext">27</span>They also demolished the sacred pillar of Baal. Then they tore down the temple of Baal and made it into a latrine, which it is to this day.
</p><p class="hdg">Jehu Repeats Jeroboam’s Sins</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Thus Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel,
<span class="reftext">29</span>but he did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit—the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Nevertheless, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sight and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> heart, four generations of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sons will sit on the throne of Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Yet Jehu was not careful to follow the instruction of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>In those days <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael defeated the Israelites throughout their territory
<span class="reftext">33</span>from the Jordan eastward through all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh), and from Aroer by the Arnon <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span> through Gilead to Bashan.
</p><p class="hdg">Jehoahaz Succeeds Jehu in Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>As for the rest of the acts of Jehu, along with all his accomplishments and all his might, are they not written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>And Jehu rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoahaz reigned in his place.
<span class="reftext">36</span>So the duration of Jehu’s reign over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew; LXX and Vulgate <i class="calibre6">officials of the city</i> <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew does not include <i class="calibre6">of the sons</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> LXX, Syriac, and Targum Yonaton; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">they had him ride</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">he went in</i>; see also verse 25.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
