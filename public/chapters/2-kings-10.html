<font ><b>Jehu Repeats Jeroboam’s Sins</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. So
Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the officials of
Jezreel, to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab,
saying: “When this letter arrives, since your master’s sons are
with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and
weaponry, select the best and most worthy son of your master, set him
on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But they were terrified and reasoned, “If
two kings could not stand against him, how can we?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the palace administrator, the overseer
of the city, the elders, and the guardians sent a message to Jehu:
“We are your servants, and we will do whatever you say. We will not
make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your sight.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehu wrote them a second letter and
said: “If you are on my side, and if you will obey me, then bring
the heads of your master’s sons to me at Jezreel by this time
tomorrow.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the sons of the king, seventy in all,
were being brought up by the leading men of the city. And when the
letter arrived, they took the sons of the king and slaughtered all
seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to
Jehu at Jezreel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu,
“They have brought the heads of the sons of the king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehu ordered, “Pile them in two
heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next morning, Jehu went out and stood
before all the people and said, “You are innocent. It was I who
conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all these?
Know, then, that not a word the LORD has spoken against the house of
Ahab will fail, for the LORD has done what He promised through His
servant Elijah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who
remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his great men and close
friends and priests, leaving him without a single survivor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehu set out toward Samaria. At
Beth-eked of the Shepherds, Jehu met some relatives of Ahaziah king
of Judah and asked, “Who are you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >We are relatives of Ahaziah,” they
answered, “and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and
of the queen mother.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehu ordered, “Take them alive.”
So his men took them alive, then slaughtered them at the well of
Beth-eked—forty-two men. He spared none of them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When he left there, he found Jehonadab son
of Rechab, who was coming to meet him. Jehu greeted him and asked,
“Is your heart as true to mine as my heart is to yours?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >It is!” Jehonadab replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >If it is,” said Jehu, “give me your
hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he gave him his hand, and Jehu helped
him into his chariot, saying, “Come with me and see my zeal for the
LORD!” So he had him ride in his chariot. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jehu came to Samaria, he struck down
everyone belonging to Ahab who remained there, until he had destroyed
them, according to the word that the LORD had spoken to Elijah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehu brought all the people together
and said, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him a
lot. Now, therefore, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his
servants, and all his priests. See that no one is missing, for I have
a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever is missing will not live.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jehu was acting deceptively in order
to destroy the servants of Baal. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehu commanded, “Proclaim a solemn
assembly for Baal.” So they announced it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehu sent word throughout Israel, and
all the servants of Baal came; there was not a man who failed to
show. They entered the temple of Baal, and it was filled from end to
end. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehu said to the keeper of the
wardrobe, “Bring out garments for all the servants of Baal.” So
he brought out garments for them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next, Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rechab
entered the temple of Baal, and Jehu said to the servants of Baal,
“Look around to see that there are no servants of the LORD here
among you—only servants of Baal.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And they went in to offer sacrifices and
burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside and warned
them, “If anyone allows one of the men I am delivering into your
hands to escape, he will forfeit his life for theirs.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When he had finished making the burnt
offering, Jehu said to the guards and officers, “Go in and kill
them. Do not let anyone out.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the guards and officers put them to the
sword, threw the bodies out, and went into the inner room of the
temple of Baal. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They brought out the sacred pillar of the
temple of Baal and burned it. They also demolished the sacred pillar
of Baal. Then they tore down the temple of Baal and made it into a
latrine, which it is to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel, but
he did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had
caused Israel to commit—the worship of the golden calves at Bethel
and Dan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, the LORD said to Jehu,
“Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in My
sight and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart,
four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet Jehu was not careful to follow the
instruction of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He
did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam had caused Israel to
commit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In those days the LORD began to reduce the
size of Israel. Hazael defeated the Israelites throughout their
territory from the Jordan eastward through all the land of Gilead
(the region of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh), and from Aroer by the
Arnon Valley through Gilead to Bashan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Jehu, along
with all his accomplishments and all his might, are they not written
in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehu rested with his fathers and was
buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoahaz reigned in his place. So the
duration of Jehu’s reign over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight
years. </font>
