<span class="reftext">2</span>They bound <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, led <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> away, and handed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> over to Pilate the governor.

<span class="reftext">4</span>“I have sinned by betraying innocent blood,” he said. </p><p class="reg1">“What is that to us?” they replied. “You bear the responsibility.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So Judas threw the silver into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>The chief priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, “It is unlawful to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.”
<span class="reftext">7</span>After conferring together, they used the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners.
<span class="reftext">8</span>That is why it has been called the <span class='cap'>Field</span><span class='nocap'>field</span> of <span class='cap'>Blood</span><span class='nocap'>blood</span> to this day.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: </p><p class="indent1stline">“They took the thirty pieces of silver, </p><p class="indent"> the price set on <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> by the people of Israel,

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then Pilate asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Do <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> not hear how many charges they are bringing against <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But Jesus gave no answer, not even to a single charge, much to the governor’s amazement.

<span class="reftext">16</span>At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">17</span>So when the crowd had assembled, Pilate asked them, “Which one do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> want me to release to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”
<span class="reftext">18</span>For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>While Pilate was sitting on the <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> seat, his wife sent him this message: “Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered terribly in a dream today because of <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>“Which of the two do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> want me to release to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>?” asked the governor. </p><p class="reg1">“Barabbas,” they replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>“What then should I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” Pilate asked. </p><p class="reg1"> They all answered, “Crucify <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>“Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> done?” </p><p class="reg1"> But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>!”

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>All the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>So Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> over to be crucified.

<span class="reftext">29</span>And they twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> head.

<span class="reftext">30</span>Then they spit on <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and took the staff and struck <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> on the head repeatedly.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>After they had mocked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, they removed the robe and put <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own clothes back on <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. Then they led <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> away to crucify <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>In the same way, the chief priests, scribes, and elders mocked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, saying,

<span class="reftext">46</span>About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, <span>“Eli, Eli,<span class="fn">h</span>  lema sabachthani?”</span> which means, <span>“My God, <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> God, why have <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> forsaken <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>?”</span><span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He is calling Elijah.”

<span class="reftext">51</span>At that moment the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.
<span class="reftext">52</span>The tombs broke open, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised.
<span class="reftext">53</span>After Jesus’ resurrection, when they had come out of the tombs, they entered the holy city and appeared to many people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">54</span>When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and said, “Truly this was the Son of God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">55</span>And many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to minister to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">56</span>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.

<span class="reftext">58</span>He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
<span class="reftext">59</span>So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
<span class="reftext">60</span>and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut into the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance to the tomb and went away.
<span class="reftext">61</span>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.

<span class="reftext">64</span>So give the order that the tomb be secured until the third day.
