<span class="reftext">2</span>and when you and your children return to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God and obey <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> voice with all your heart and all your soul according to everything I am giving you today,
<span class="reftext">3</span>then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will restore you from captivity<span class="fn">a</span>  and have compassion on you and gather you from all the nations to which <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has scattered you.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Even if you have been banished to the farthest horizon,<span class="fn">b</span>  <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will gather you and return you from there.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will bring you into the land your fathers possessed, and you will take possession of it. He will cause you to prosper and multiply more than your fathers.
<span class="reftext">6</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, and you will love <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will put all these curses upon your enemies who hate you and persecute you.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And you will again obey the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and follow all <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> commandments I am giving you today.
<span class="reftext">9</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will make you abound in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your land. Indeed, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will again delight in your goodness, as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> delighted in that of your fathers,
<span class="reftext">10</span>if you obey <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God by keeping <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> commandments and statutes that are written in this <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span>, and if you turn to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> with all your heart and with all your soul.
</p><p class="hdg">The Choice of Life or Death</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>For this commandment I give you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach.
<span class="reftext">12</span>It is not in heaven, that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> should need to ask, ‘Who will ascend into heaven<span class="fn">d</span>  to get it for us and proclaim it, that we may obey it?’
<span class="reftext">13</span>And it is not beyond the sea, that you should need to ask, ‘Who will cross the sea<span class="fn">e</span>  to get it for us and proclaim it, that we may obey it?’
<span class="reftext">14</span>But the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,<span class="fn">f</span>  so that you may obey it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>See, I have set before you today life and goodness, as well as death and disaster.
<span class="reftext">16</span>For I am commanding you today to love <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, to walk in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> ways, and to keep <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> commandments, statutes, and ordinances, so that you may live and increase, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God may bless you in the land that you are entering to possess.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>But if your heart turns away and you do not listen, but are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them,
<span class="reftext">18</span>I declare to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> today that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will surely perish; <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> shall not prolong <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> days in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>I call heaven and earth as witnesses against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> today that I have set before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> life and death, blessing and cursing. Therefore choose life, so that you and your descendants may live,
<span class="reftext">20</span>and that you may love <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, obey <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, and hold fast to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. For <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is your life, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will prolong your life in the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">restore your fortunes</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">to the extremity of the heavens</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Cited in Nehemiah 1:8–9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Cited in Romans 10:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> See Romans 10:7.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Cited in Romans 10:8<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
