<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Promise of Restoration<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Nehemiah 1:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>“When all these things come upon you—the blessings and curses I have set before you—and you call them to mind in all the nations to which <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has banished you,
<span class="reftext">2</span>and when you and your children return to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God and obey His voice with all your heart and all your soul according to everything I am giving you today,
<span class="reftext">3</span>then He will restore you from captivity<span class="fn">a</span>  and have compassion on you and gather you from all the nations to which <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has scattered you.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Even if you have been banished to the farthest horizon,<span class="fn">b</span>  He will gather you and return you from there.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will bring you into the land your fathers possessed, and you will take possession of it. He will cause you to prosper and multiply more than your fathers.
<span class="reftext">6</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, and you will love Him with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will put all these curses upon your enemies who hate you and persecute you.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And you will again obey the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and follow all His commandments I am giving you today.
<span class="reftext">9</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will make you abound in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the offspring of your livestock, and the produce of your land. Indeed, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will again delight in your goodness, as He delighted in that of your fathers,
<span class="reftext">10</span>if you obey <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God by keeping His commandments and statutes that are written in this Book of the Law, and if you turn to Him with all your heart and with all your soul.
</p><p class="hdg">The Choice of Life or Death</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>For this commandment I give you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach.
<span class="reftext">12</span>It is not in heaven, that you should need to ask, ‘Who will ascend into heaven<span class="fn">d</span>  to get it for us and proclaim it, that we may obey it?’
<span class="reftext">13</span>And it is not beyond the sea, that you should need to ask, ‘Who will cross the sea<span class="fn">e</span>  to get it for us and proclaim it, that we may obey it?’
<span class="reftext">14</span>But the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,<span class="fn">f</span>  so that you may obey it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>See, I have set before you today life and goodness, as well as death and disaster.
<span class="reftext">16</span>For I am commanding you today to love <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, statutes, and ordinances, so that you may live and increase, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God may bless you in the land that you are entering to possess.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>But if your heart turns away and you do not listen, but are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them,
<span class="reftext">18</span>I declare to you today that you will surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Therefore choose life, so that you and your descendants may live,
<span class="reftext">20</span>and that you may love <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, obey Him, and hold fast to Him. For He is your life, and He will prolong your life in the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">restore your fortunes</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">to the extremity of the heavens</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Cited in Nehemiah 1:8–9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Cited in Romans 10:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> See Romans 10:7.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Cited in Romans 10:8<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
