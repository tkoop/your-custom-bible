“<font >When all these things come upon you—the
blessings and curses I have set before you—and you call them to
mind in all the nations to which the LORD your God has banished you,
and when you and your children return to the LORD your God and obey
His voice with all your heart and all your soul according to
everything I am giving you today, then He will restore you from
captivity and have compassion on you and gather you from all the
nations to which the LORD your God has scattered you. Even if you
have been banished to the farthest horizon, He will gather you and
return you from there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And the LORD your God will bring you into
the land your fathers possessed, and you will take possession of it.
He will cause you to prosper and multiply more than your fathers. The
LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your
descendants, and you will love Him with all your heart and with all
your soul, so that you may live. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the LORD your God will put all these
curses upon your enemies who hate you and persecute you. And you will
again obey the voice of the LORD and follow all His commandments I am
giving you today. So the LORD your God will make you abound in all
the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the offspring
of your livestock, and the produce of your land. Indeed, the LORD
will again delight in your goodness, as He delighted in that of your
fathers, if you obey the LORD your God by keeping His commandments
and statutes that are written in this Book of the Law, and if you
turn to Him with all your heart and with all your soul. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >For this commandment I give you today is
not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. It is not in heaven,
that you should need to ask, ‘Who will ascend into heaven to get it
for us and proclaim it, that we may obey it?’ And it is not beyond
the sea, that you should need to ask, ‘Who will cross the sea to
get it for us and proclaim it, that we may obey it?’ But the word
is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you
may obey it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >See, I have set before you today life and
goodness, as well as death and disaster. For I am commanding you
today to love the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His
commandments, statutes, and ordinances, so that you may live and
increase, and the LORD your God may bless you in the land that you
are entering to possess. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But if your heart turns away and you do
not listen, but are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship
them, I declare to you today that you will surely perish; you shall
not prolong your days in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to
possess. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >I call heaven and earth as witnesses
against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing
and cursing. Therefore choose life, so that you and your descendants
may live, and that you may love the LORD your God, obey Him, and hold
fast to Him. For He is your life, and He will prolong your life in
the land that the LORD swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob.” </font>
