<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Greeting from the Elder<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(3 John 1:1–4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>The elder, </p><p class="reg1"> To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth—and not I alone, but also all who know the truth—
<span class="reftext">2</span>because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Grace, mercy, and peace from God the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, will be with us in truth and love.
</p><p class="hdg">Walking in the Truth<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(John 8:30–47)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> has commanded us.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And now I urge you, dear lady—not as a new commandment to you, but one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And this is love, that we walk according to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> commandments. This is the very commandment <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have heard from the beginning, that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must walk in love.
</p><p class="hdg">Beware of Deceivers</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, refusing to confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Watch yourselves, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not lose what we have worked for,<span class="fn">a</span>  but that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may be fully rewarded.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Anyone who runs ahead without remaining in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> teaching has both the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> and the Son.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>If anyone comes to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> but does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home or even greet him.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Whoever greets such a person shares in his evil deeds.
</p><p class="hdg">Conclusion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(3 John 1:13–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>I have many things to write to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, but I would prefer not to do so with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come and speak with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> face to face,<span class="fn">b</span>  so that our joy may be complete.
