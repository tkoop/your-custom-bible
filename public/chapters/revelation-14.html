<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Lamb and the 144,000</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then I looked and saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> 144,000 who had <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> name and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>’s name written on their foreheads.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And I heard a sound from <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> like the roar of many waters and the loud rumbling of thunder. And the sound I heard was like harpists strumming their harps.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. And no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
<span class="reftext">4</span>These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> goes. They have been redeemed from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And no lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Three Angels and Babylon’s Fall</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then I saw another angel flying overhead, with the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And he said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> glory, because the hour of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> has come. Worship the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and the springs of waters.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then a second angel followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great,<span class="fn">b</span>  who has made all the nations drink the wine of the passion of her immorality.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And a third angel followed them, calling out in a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives its mark on his forehead or on his hand,
<span class="reftext">10</span>he too will drink the wine of God’s anger, poured undiluted into the cup of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> wrath. And he will be tormented in fire and <span class='spell ca'>sulphur</span><span class='spell gb'>sulphur</span><span class='spell us'>sulfur</span> in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the smoke of their torment rises forever and ever. Day and night there is no rest for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Here is a call for the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And I heard a voice from <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> telling me to write, “Blessed are the dead—those who die in the Lord from this moment on.” </p><p class="reg1">“Yes,” says the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>, “they will rest from their <span class='spell ca'>labours</span><span class='spell gb'>labours</span><span class='spell us'>labors</span>, for their deeds will follow them.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Harvest of the Earth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And I looked and saw a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> like the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of Man,<span class="fn">c</span>  with a golden crown on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> head and a sharp sickle in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> hand.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then another angel came out of the temple, crying out in a loud voice to the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> seated on the cloud, “Swing <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> sickle and reap, because the time has come to harvest; for the crop of the earth is ripe.”
<span class="reftext">16</span>So the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> seated on the cloud swung <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then another angel came out of the temple in <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>, and he too had a sharp sickle.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Still another angel, with authority over the fire, came from the altar and called out in a loud voice to the angel with the sharp sickle, “Swing your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the vine of the earth, because its grapes are ripe.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the grapes of the earth, and he threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and the blood that flowed from it rose as high as the bridles of the horses for a distance of 1,600 stadia.<span class="fn">d</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">before the throne of God</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> See Isaiah 21:9 and Revelation 18:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">one like a son of man</i>; see Daniel 7:13.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">1,600 stadia</i> is approximately 184 miles or 296 kilometers.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
