<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Council at Jerusalem<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 15:5–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem, accompanied by Barnabas. I took Titus along also.
<span class="reftext">2</span>I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I spoke privately to those <span class='spell ca'>recognized</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognized</span> as leaders, for fear that I was running or had already run in vain.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>This issue arose because some false brothers had come in under false pretenses to spy on our freedom in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us.
<span class="reftext">5</span>We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>But as for the highly esteemed—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show favoritism<span class="fn">a</span>—those leaders added nothing to me.
<span class="reftext">7</span>On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted to preach the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been to the circumcised.
<span class="reftext">8</span>For the One who was at work in Peter’s apostleship to the circumcised was also at work in my apostleship to the Gentiles.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And recognizing the grace that I had been given, James, Cephas,<span class="fn">b</span>  and John—those reputed to be pillars—gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, so that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.
<span class="reftext">10</span>They only asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul Confronts Cephas</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>When Cephas came to Antioch, however, I opposed him to his face, because he stood to be condemned.
<span class="reftext">12</span>For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself, for fear of those in the circumcision group.
<span class="reftext">13</span>The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When I saw that they were not walking in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “If you, who are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>We who are Jews by birth and not Gentile “sinners”
<span class="reftext">16</span>know that a man is not justified by works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have believed in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are found to be sinners, does that make Christ a minister of sin? Certainly not!
<span class="reftext">18</span>If I rebuild what I have already torn down, I prove myself to be a lawbreaker.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>For through the law I died to the law so that I might live to God.
<span class="reftext">20</span>I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
<span class="reftext">21</span>I do not set aside the grace of God. For if righteousness comes through the law, Christ died for nothing.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">God does not accept the face of man</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, Peter; also in verses 11 and 14<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Some translators close this quotation after verse 16 or 21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
