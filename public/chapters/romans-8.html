<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Walking by the Spirit<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Ezekiel 36:16–38; Galatians 5:16–26)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For in Christ Jesus the law of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of life set you<span class="fn">b</span>  free from the law of sin and death.
<span class="reftext">3</span>For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own Son in the likeness of sinful man, as an offering for sin.<span class="fn">c</span>  He thus condemned sin in the flesh,
<span class="reftext">4</span>so that the righteous standard of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh; but those who live according to the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> set their minds on the things of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>.
<span class="reftext">6</span>The mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> is life and peace,
<span class="reftext">7</span>because the mind of the flesh is hostile to God: It does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Those controlled by the flesh<span class="fn">d</span>  cannot please God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>You, however, are controlled not by the flesh, but by the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, if the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive<span class="fn">e</span>  because of righteousness.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And if the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> who raised Christ Jesus from the dead<span class="fn">f</span>  will also give life to your mortal bodies through <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, who lives in you.
</p><p class="hdg">Heirs with Christ</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation, but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
<span class="reftext">14</span>For all who are led by the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of God are sons of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>For you did not receive a spirit of slavery that returns you to fear, but you received the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of sonship, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!”
<span class="reftext">16</span>The <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And if we are children, then we are heirs: heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ—if indeed we suffer with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, so that we may also be glorified with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
</p><p class="hdg">Future Glory<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Corinthians 5:1–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>I consider that our present sufferings are not comparable to the glory that will be revealed in us.
<span class="reftext">19</span>The creation waits in eager expectation for the revelation of the sons of God.
<span class="reftext">20</span>For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will, but because of the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who subjected it, in hope
<span class="reftext">21</span>that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>We know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until the present time.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Not only that, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.
<span class="reftext">24</span>For in this hope we were saved; but hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he can already see?
<span class="reftext">25</span>But if we hope for what we do not yet see, we wait for it patiently.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>In the same way, the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> helps us in our weakness. For we do not know how we ought to pray, but the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> intercedes for us with groans too deep for words.
<span class="reftext">27</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> who searches our hearts knows the mind of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, because the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
</p><p class="hdg">God Works in All Things<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Ephesians 1:3–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>And we know that God works all things together for the good of those who love <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, who are called according to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> purpose.
<span class="reftext">29</span>For those God foreknew, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> also predestined to be conformed to the image of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> Son, so that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> would be the firstborn among many brothers.
<span class="reftext">30</span>And those <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> predestined, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> also called; those <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> called, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> also justified; those <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> justified, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> also glorified.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>What then shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
<span class="reftext">32</span>He who did not spare <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own Son but gave <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> up for us all, how will <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> not also, along with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, freely give us all things?
<span class="reftext">33</span>Who will bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies.
<span class="reftext">34</span>Who is there to condemn us? For Christ Jesus, who died, and more than that was raised to life, is at the right hand of God—and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is interceding for us.
</p><p class="hdg">More than Conquerors<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 44:1–26)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
<span class="reftext">36</span>As it is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">“For <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> sake we face death all day long; </p><p class="indent"> we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> who loved us.
<span class="reftext">38</span>For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor principalities, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
<span class="reftext">39</span>neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">me</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Those being in the flesh</i>; similarly in verse 9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">yet the Spirit is life</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> NA, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">raised Christ from the dead</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Psalm 44:22<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
