<font >Therefore, there is now no condemnation
for those who are in Christ Jesus. For in Christ Jesus the law of the
Spirit of life set you free from the law of sin and death. For what
the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God
did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful man, as an
offering for sin. He thus condemned sin in the flesh, so that the
righteous standard of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not
walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Those who live according to the flesh set
their minds on the things of the flesh; but those who live according
to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. The mind
of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace,
because the mind of the flesh is hostile to God: It does not submit
to God’s law, nor can it do so. Those controlled by the flesh
cannot please God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >You, however, are controlled not by the
flesh, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if
anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to
Christ. But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin,
yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. And if the Spirit
of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised
Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies
through His Spirit, who lives in you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Therefore, brothers, we have an
obligation, but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it. For
if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the
Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For all
who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >For you did not receive a spirit of
slavery that returns you to fear, but you received the Spirit of
sonship, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” The Spirit Himself
testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. And if we are
children, then we are heirs: heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ—if
indeed we suffer with Him, so that we may also be glorified with Him.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >I consider that our present sufferings are
not comparable to the glory that will be revealed in us. The creation
waits in eager expectation for the revelation of the sons of God. For
the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own will, but
because of the One who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself
will be set free from its bondage to decay and brought into the
glorious freedom of the children of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >We know that the whole creation has been
groaning together in the pains of childbirth until the present time.
Not only that, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the
Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons,
the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved; but
hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he can
already see? But if we hope for what we do not yet see, we wait for
it patiently. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >In the same way, the Spirit helps us in
our weakness. For we do not know how we ought to pray, but the Spirit
Himself intercedes for us with groans too deep for words. And He who
searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit
intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And we know that God works all things
together for the good of those who love Him, who are called according
to His purpose. For those God foreknew, He also predestined to be
conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn
among many brothers. And those He predestined, He also called; those
He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >What then shall we say in response to
these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not
spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also,
along with Him, freely give us all things? Who will bring any charge
against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is there to
condemn us? For Christ Jesus, who died, and more than that was raised
to life, is at the right hand of God—and He is interceding for us. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Who shall separate us from the love of
Christ? Shall trouble or distress or persecution or famine or
nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >No, in all these things we are more than
conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither
death nor life, neither angels nor principalities, neither the
present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor
anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the
love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. </font>
