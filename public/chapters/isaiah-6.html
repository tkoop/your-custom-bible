<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Isaiah’s Commission<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 13:10–17; Mark 4:10–12; Acts 28:16–31)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted; and the train of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> robe<span class="fn">a</span>  filled the temple.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Above <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> stood seraphim, each having six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And they were calling out to one another: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Holy, holy, holy is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts; </p><p class="indent"> all the earth is full of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> glory.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook, and the temple was filled with smoke.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then I said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Woe is me, </p><p class="indent"> for I am ruined, </p><p class="indent1"> because I am a man of unclean lips </p><p class="indent"> dwelling among a people of unclean lips; </p><p class="indent1"> for my eyes have seen the King, </p><p class="indent"> <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And with it he touched my mouth and said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Now that this has touched your lips, </p><p class="indent"> your iniquity is removed </p><p class="indent"> and your sin is atoned for.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Whom shall I send? </p><p class="indent"> Who will go for <span class='cap'>Us</span><span class='nocap'>us</span>?” </p><p class="reg1"> And I said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Here am I. Send me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> replied: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Go and tell this people, </p><p class="indent"> ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding; </p><p class="indent"> be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Make the hearts of this people calloused; </p><p class="indent"> deafen their ears and close their eyes. </p><p class="indent1"> Otherwise they might see with their eyes, </p><p class="indent"> hear with their ears, </p><p class="indent"> understand with their hearts, </p><p class="indent1"> and turn and be healed.<span class="fn">c</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then I asked: </p><p class="indent1stline">“How long, O Lord?” </p><p class="reg1"> And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> replied: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Until the cities lie ruined </p><p class="indent1"> and without inhabitant, </p><p class="indent1"> until the houses are left unoccupied </p><p class="indent"> and the land is desolate and ravaged,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>until <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has driven men far away </p><p class="indent"> and the land is utterly forsaken.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And though a tenth remains in the land, </p><p class="indent"> it will be burned again. </p><p class="indent1"> As the terebinth and oak leave stumps when felled, </p><p class="indent"> so the holy seed will be a stump in the land.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the hem of His robe</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew; LXX <i class="calibre6">‘You shall be ever hearing, but never understanding; you shall be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’</i> Cited in Matthew 13:14, Mark 4:12, Luke 8:10, and Acts 28:26<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew; LXX <i class="calibre6">For this people’s heart has grown callous; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes.
