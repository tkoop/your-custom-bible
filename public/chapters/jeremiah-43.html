<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jeremiah Taken to Egypt</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When Jeremiah had finished telling all the people all the words of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> their God—everything that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had sent him to say—
<span class="reftext">2</span>Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are lying! <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> our God has not sent you to say, ‘You must not go to Egypt to reside there.’
<span class="reftext">3</span>Rather, Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans,<span class="fn">a</span>  so that they may put us to death or exile us to Babylon!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces disobeyed the command of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to stay in the land of Judah.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the whole remnant of Judah, those who had returned to the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been scattered,
<span class="reftext">6</span>the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan captain of the guard had allowed to remain with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as well as Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>So they entered the land of Egypt because they did not obey the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and they went as far as Tahpanhes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Jeremiah at Tahpanhes:
<span class="reftext">9</span>“In the sight of the Jews, pick up some large stones and bury them in the clay of the brick <span class='spell ca'>pavement</span><span class='spell gb'>roadway</span><span class='spell us'>pavement</span> at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace at Tahpanhes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then tell them that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones that I have embedded, and he will spread his royal pavilion over them.
<span class="reftext">11</span>He will come and strike down the land of Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>I will kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and Nebuchadnezzar will burn those temples and take their gods as captives.<span class="fn">b</span>  So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself in his garment, and he will depart from there unscathed.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He will demolish the sacred pillars of the temple of the sun in the land of Egypt,<span class="fn">c</span>  and he will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the Babylonians<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">and he will burn them and take them captive</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">He will demolish the pillars of Heliopolis in On</i> or <i class="calibre6">He will demolish the pillars of Heliopolis in Egypt</i>; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">He will demolish the pillars of Beth-shemesh in the land of Egypt</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
