<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now King David was old and well along in
years, and though they covered him with blankets, he could not keep
warm. So his servants said to him, “Let us search for a young
virgin for our lord the king, to attend to him and care for him and
lie by his side to keep him warm.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they searched throughout Israel for a
beautiful girl, and they found Abishag the Shunammite and brought her
to the king. The girl was unsurpassed in beauty; she cared for the
king and served him, but he had no relations with her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Adonijah, David’s son by
Haggith, began to exalt himself, saying, “I will be king!” And he
acquired chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run ahead of him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">(His father had never once reprimanded him
by saying, “Why do you act this way?” Adonijah was also very
handsome, born next after Absalom.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Adonijah conferred with Joab son of
Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, who supported him. But Zadok
the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei,
and David’s mighty men would not join Adonijah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and
fattened calves near the stone of Zoheleth, which is next to
En-rogel. He invited all his royal brothers and all the men of Judah
who were servants of the king. But he did not invite Nathan the
prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, or his brother Solomon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother
of Solomon, “Have you not heard that Adonijah son of Haggith has
become king, and our lord David does not know it? Now please, come
and let me advise you. Save your own life and the life of your son
Solomon. Go at once to King David and say, ‘My lord the king, did
you not swear to your maidservant, “Surely your son Solomon will
reign after me, and he will sit on my throne”? Why then has
Adonijah become king?’ Then, while you are still there speaking
with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Bathsheba went to see the king in his
bedroom. Since the king was very old, Abishag the Shunammite was
serving him. And Bathsheba bowed down in homage to the king, who
asked, “What is your desire?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">My lord,” she replied, “you
yourself swore to your maidservant by the LORD your God: ‘Surely
your son Solomon will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne.’
But now, behold, Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king,
did not know it. And he has sacrificed an abundance of oxen, fattened
calves, and sheep, and has invited all the other sons of the king, as
well as Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army. But
he did not invite your servant Solomon. And as for you, my lord the
king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you to tell them who will sit
on the throne of my lord the king after him. Otherwise, when my lord
the king rests with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be counted
as criminals.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And just then, while Bathsheba was still
speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. So the king was
told, “Nathan the prophet is here.” And Nathan went in and bowed
facedown before the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">My lord the king,” said Nathan, “did
you say, ‘Adonijah will reign after me, and he will sit on my
throne’? For today he has gone down and sacrificed an abundance of
oxen, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the sons of the
king, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And
behold, they are eating and drinking before him, saying, ‘Long live
King Adonijah!’ But me your servant he did not invite, nor Zadok
the priest, nor Benaiah son of Jehoiada, nor your servant Solomon.
Has my lord the king let this happen without informing your servant
who should sit on the throne after my lord the king?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King David said, “Call in Bathsheba
for me.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before
him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the king swore an oath, saying, “As
surely as the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,
I will carry out this very day exactly what I swore to you by the
LORD, the God of Israel: Surely your son Solomon will reign after me,
and he will sit on my throne in my place.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Bathsheba bowed facedown in homage to the
king and said, “May my lord King David live forever!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King David said, “Call in for me
Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.”
So they came before the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Take my servants with you,” said the
king. “Set my son Solomon on my own mule and take him down to
Gihon. There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint
him king over Israel. You are to blow the ram’s horn and declare,
‘Long live King Solomon!’ Then you shall go up with him, and he
is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. For I have
appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Amen,” replied Benaiah son of
Jehoiada. “May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare
it. Just as the LORD was with my lord the king, so may He be with
Solomon and make his throne even greater than that of my lord King
David.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet,
and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, along with the Cherethites and
Pelethites, went down and set Solomon on King David’s mule, and
they escorted him to Gihon. Zadok the priest took the horn of oil
from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the ram’s
horn, and all the people proclaimed, “Long live King Solomon!” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">All the people followed him, playing
flutes and rejoicing with such a great joy that the earth was split

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Adonijah and all his guests were
finishing their feast when they heard the sound of the ram’s horn.
“Why is the city in such a loud uproar?” asked Joab. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As he was speaking, suddenly Jonathan the
son of Abiathar the priest arrived. “Come in,” said Adonijah,
“for you are a man of valor. You must be bringing good news.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Not at all,” Jonathan replied. “Our
lord King David has made Solomon king. And with Solomon, the king has
sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of
Jehoiada, along with the Cherethites and Pelethites, and they have
set him on the king’s mule. Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet
have anointed him king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there
with rejoicing that rings out in the city. That is the noise you
hear. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king’s servants have also gone to
congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the
name of Solomon more famous than your own name, and may He make his
throne greater than your throne.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the king has bowed in worship on his

<font face="Tahoma, serif">At this, all the guests of Adonijah arose
in terror and scattered. But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, got up and
went to take hold of the horns of the altar. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">It was reported to Solomon: “Behold,

from the altar, and he came and bowed down before King Solomon, who
said to him, “Go to your home.” </font>
