</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>The Spirit of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> spoke through me; </p><p class="indent"> His word was on my tongue.

</p><p class="hdg">David’s Mighty Men<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 11:10–47)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>These are the names of David’s mighty men: </p><p class="list1stline"> Josheb-basshebeth the Tahchemonite<span class="fn">b</span>  was chief of the Three.<span class="fn">c</span>  He wielded his spear against<span class="fn">d</span>  eight hundred men, whom he killed at one time.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Next in command was Eleazar son of Dodo<span class="fn">e</span>  the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty men, he went with David to taunt the Philistines who had gathered for battle at Pas-dammim. The men of Israel retreated,
<span class="reftext">10</span>but Eleazar stood his ground and struck the Philistines until his hand grew weary and stuck to his sword. <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> brought about a great victory that day. Then the troops returned to him, but only to plunder the dead.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>And after him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines had banded together near a field full of lentils, Israel’s troops fled from them.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field, defended it, and struck down the Philistines. So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> brought about a great victory.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>At harvest time, three of the thirty chief men went down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a company of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
<span class="reftext">14</span>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was at Bethlehem.
<span class="reftext">15</span>David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine camp, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem, and brought it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,
<span class="reftext">17</span>saying, “Far be it from me, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, to do this! Is this not the blood of the men who risked their lives?” So he refused to drink it. </p><p class="reg1"> Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Now Abishai, the brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah, was chief of the Three,<span class="fn">f</span>  and he lifted his spear against three hundred men, killed them, and won a name along with the Three.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Was he not more <span class='spell ca'>honoured</span><span class='spell gb'>honoured</span><span class='spell us'>honored</span> than the Three?<span class="fn">g</span>  And he became their commander, even though he was not included among the Three.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a man of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span><span class="fn">h</span>  from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits. He struck down two champions<span class="fn">i</span>  of Moab, and on a snowy day he went down into a pit and killed a lion.
<span class="reftext">21</span>He also killed an Egyptian, a huge man. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club, snatched the spear from his hand, and killed the Egyptian with his own spear.
<span class="reftext">22</span>These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who won a name alongside the three mighty men.
<span class="reftext">23</span>He was most <span class='spell ca'>honoured</span><span class='spell gb'>honoured</span><span class='spell us'>honored</span> among the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. And David appointed him over his guard.
