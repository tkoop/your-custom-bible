<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Esther Appeals for the Jews</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">That same day King Xerxes awarded Queen
Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai
entered the king’s presence because Esther had revealed his
relation to her. The king removed the signet ring he had recovered
from Haman and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed
Mordecai over the estate of Haman. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And once again, Esther addressed the king.
She fell at his feet weeping and begged him to revoke the evil scheme
of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king extended the gold scepter toward
Esther, and she arose and stood before the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">If it pleases the king,” she said,
“and if I have found favor in his sight, and the matter seems
proper to the king, and I am pleasing in his sight, may an order be
written to revoke the letters that the scheming Haman son of
Hammedatha, the Agagite, wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king’s
provinces. For how could I bear to see the disaster that would befall
my people? How could I bear to see the destruction of my kindred?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So King Xerxes said to Esther the Queen
and Mordecai the Jew, “Behold, I have given Haman’s estate to
Esther, and he was hanged on the gallows because he attacked the
Jews. Now you may write in the king’s name as you please regarding
the Jews, and seal it with the royal signet ring. For a decree that
is written in the name of the king and sealed with the royal signet
ring cannot be revoked.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At once the royal scribes were summoned,
and on the twenty-third day of the third month (the month of Sivan),
they recorded all of Mordecai’s orders to the Jews and to the
satraps, governors, and princes of the 127 provinces from India to
Cush —writing to each province in its own script, to every people
in their own language, and to the Jews in their own script and
language. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes
and sealed it with the royal signet ring. He sent the documents by
mounted couriers riding on swift horses bred from the royal mares. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By these letters the king permitted the
Jews in each and every city the right to assemble and defend
themselves, to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the forces of any
people or province hostile to them, including women and children, and
to plunder their possessions. The single day appointed throughout all
the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month, the month of Adar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">A copy of the text of the edict was to be
issued in every province and published to all the people, so that the
Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their
enemies. The couriers rode out in haste on their royal horses,
pressed on by the command of the king. And the edict was also issued
in the citadel of Susa. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Mordecai went out from the presence of the
king in royal garments of blue and white, with a large gold crown and
a purple robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa shouted and
rejoiced. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the Jews it was a time of light and
gladness, of joy and honor. In every province and every city,
wherever the king’s edict and decree reached, there was joy and
gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many of
the people of the land themselves became Jews, because the fear of
the Jews had fallen upon them. </font>
