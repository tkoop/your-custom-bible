</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The heavens praise Your wonders, O LORD—</p><p class="indent"> Your faithfulness as well—</p><p class="indent"> in the assembly of the holy ones.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For who in the skies can compare with the LORD? </p><p class="indent"> Who among the heavenly beings<span class="fn">b</span>  is like the LORD?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>In the council of the holy ones, God is greatly feared, </p><p class="indent"> and awesome above all who surround Him.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>You rule the raging sea; </p><p class="indent"> when its waves mount up, You still them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>You crushed Rahab like a carcass; </p><p class="indent"> You scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The heavens are Yours, and also the earth. </p><p class="indent"> The earth and its fullness You founded.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>North and south You created; </p><p class="indent"> Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at Your name.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Mighty is Your arm; strong is Your hand. </p><p class="indent"> Your right hand is exalted.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; </p><p class="indent"> loving devotion and faithfulness go before You.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>Blessed are those who know the joyful sound, </p><p class="indent"> who walk, O LORD, in the light of Your presence.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Surely our shield belongs to the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> and our king to the Holy One of Israel.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>You once spoke in a vision; </p><p class="indent"> to Your godly ones You said, </p><p class="indent1">“I have bestowed help on a warrior; </p><p class="indent"> I have exalted one chosen from the people.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>I have found My servant David; </p><p class="indent"> with My sacred oil I have anointed him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>My hand will sustain him; </p><p class="indent"> surely My arm will strengthen him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>No enemy will exact tribute; </p><p class="indent"> no wicked man will oppress him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>I will crush his foes before him </p><p class="indent"> and strike down those who hate him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>My faithfulness and loving devotion will be with him, </p><p class="indent"> and through My name his horn will be exalted.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>I will set his hand over the sea, </p><p class="indent"> and his right hand upon the rivers.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>He will call to Me, ‘You are my Father, </p><p class="indent"> my God, the Rock of my salvation.’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>I will indeed appoint him as My firstborn, </p><p class="indent"> the highest of the kings of the earth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>I will forever preserve My loving devotion for him, </p><p class="indent"> and My covenant with him will stand fast.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>I will establish his line forever, </p><p class="indent"> his throne as long as the heavens endure.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">30</span>If his sons forsake My law </p><p class="indent"> and do not walk in My <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span>,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>if they violate My statutes </p><p class="indent"> and fail to keep My commandments,

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">33</span>But I will not withdraw My loving devotion from him, </p><p class="indent"> nor ever betray My faithfulness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">34</span>I will not violate My covenant </p><p class="indent"> or alter the utterance of My lips.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Once and for all I have sworn by My holiness—</p><p class="indent"> I will not lie to David—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">36</span>his offspring shall endure forever, </p><p class="indent"> and his throne before Me like the sun,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">37</span>like the moon, established forever, </p><p class="indent"> a faithful witness in the sky.” </p><p class="selah"> Selah
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">38</span>Now, however, You have spurned and rejected him; </p><p class="indent"> You are enraged by Your anointed one.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">39</span>You have renounced the covenant with Your servant </p><p class="indent"> and sullied his crown in the dust.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">40</span>You have broken down all his walls; </p><p class="indent"> You have reduced his strongholds to rubble.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">41</span>All who pass by plunder him; </p><p class="indent"> he has become a reproach to his neighbors.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">42</span>You have exalted the right hand of his foes; </p><p class="indent"> You have made all his enemies rejoice.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">43</span>You have bent the edge of his sword </p><p class="indent"> and have not sustained him in battle.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">44</span>You have ended his <span class='spell ca'>splendour</span><span class='spell gb'>splendour</span><span class='spell us'>splendor</span> </p><p class="indent"> and cast his throne to the ground.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">45</span>You have cut short the days of his youth; </p><p class="indent"> You have covered him with shame. </p><p class="selah"> Selah
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">46</span>How long, O LORD? </p><p class="indent"> Will You hide Yourself forever? </p><p class="indent"> Will Your wrath keep burning like fire?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">47</span>Remember the briefness of my lifespan! </p><p class="indent"> For what futility You have created all men!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">48</span>What man can live and never see death? </p><p class="indent"> Can he deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? </p><p class="selah"> Selah
