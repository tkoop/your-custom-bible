<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a><span class="reftext">2</span>And Abram had become extremely wealthy in livestock and silver and gold.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>From the Negev he journeyed from place to place toward Bethel, until he came to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had formerly been pitched,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a><span class="reftext">4</span>to the site where he had built the altar. And there Abram called on the name of the LORD.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a><span class="reftext">6</span>But the land was unable to support both of them while they stayed together, for they had so many possessions that they were unable to coexist.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a><span class="reftext">7</span>And there was discord between the herdsmen of Abram and the herdsmen of Lot. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were also living in the land.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So Abram said to Lot, “Please let there be no contention between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen. After all, we are brothers.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a><span class="reftext">9</span>Is not the whole land before you? Now separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, I will go to the right; if you go to the right, I will go to the left.”

(This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a><span class="reftext">11</span>So Lot chose the whole plain of the Jordan for himself and set out toward the east. And Abram and Lot parted company.
