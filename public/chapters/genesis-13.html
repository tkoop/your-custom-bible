<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Abram went up out of Egypt into the
Negev—he and his wife and all his possessions—and Lot was with
him. And Abram had become extremely wealthy in livestock and silver
and gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">From the Negev he journeyed from place to
place toward Bethel, until he came to the place between Bethel and Ai
where his tent had formerly been pitched, to the site where he had
built the altar. And there Abram called on the name of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram,
also had flocks and herds and tents. But the land was unable to
support both of them while they stayed together, for they had so many
possessions that they were unable to coexist. And there was discord
between the herdsmen of Abram and the herdsmen of Lot. At that time
the Canaanites and the Perizzites were also living in the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Abram said to Lot, “Please let there
be no contention between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my
herdsmen. After all, we are brothers. Is not the whole land before
you? Now separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, I will go
to the right; if you go to the right, I will go to the left.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Lot looked out and saw that the whole
plain of the Jordan, all the way to Zoar, was well watered like the
garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt. (This was before the LORD
destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) So Lot chose the whole plain of the
Jordan for himself and set out toward the east. And Abram and Lot
parted company. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Abram lived in the land of Canaan, but Lot
settled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
But the men of Sodom were wicked, sinning greatly against the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After Lot had departed, the LORD said to
Abram, “Now lift up your eyes from the place where you are, and
look to the north and south and east and west, for all the land that
you see, I will give to you and your offspring forever. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will make your offspring like the dust
of the earth, so that if one could count the dust of the earth, then
your offspring could be counted. Get up and walk around the land,
through its length and breadth, for I will give it to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Abram moved his tent and went to live
near the Oaks of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the
LORD. </font>
