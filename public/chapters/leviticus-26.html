destroy your sight and drain your life. You will sow your seed in

execute the vengeance of the covenant. Though you withdraw into your
cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be delivered
into the hand of the enemy. When I cut off your supply of bread, ten
women will bake your bread in a single oven and dole out your bread
by weight, so that you will eat but not be satisfied. </font>
