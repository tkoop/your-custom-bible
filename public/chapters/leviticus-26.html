“<font >You must not make idols for yourselves
or set up a carved image or sacred pillar; you must not place a
sculpted stone in your land to bow down to it. For I am the LORD your
God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You must keep My Sabbaths and have
reverence for My sanctuary. I am the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If you follow My statutes and carefully
keep My commandments, I will give you rains in their season, and the
land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will bear
their fruit. Your threshing will continue until the grape harvest,
and the grape harvest will continue until sowing time; you will have
your fill of food to eat and will dwell securely in your land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And I will give peace to the land, and you
will lie down with nothing to fear. I will rid the land of dangerous
animals, and no sword will pass through your land. You will pursue
your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you. Five of you
will pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you will pursue ten thousand,
and your enemies will fall by the sword before you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I will turn toward you and make you
fruitful and multiply you, and I will establish My covenant with you.
You will still be eating the old supply of grain when you need to
clear it out to make room for the new. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And I will make My dwelling place among
you, and My soul will not despise you. I will walk among you and be
your God, and you will be My people. I am the LORD your God, who
brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you would no longer be
slaves to the Egyptians. I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled
you to walk in uprightness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If, however, you fail to obey Me and to
carry out all these commandments, and if you reject My statutes,
despise My ordinances, and neglect to carry out all My commandments,
and so break My covenant, then this is what I will do to you: I will
bring upon you sudden terror, wasting disease, and fever that will
destroy your sight and drain your life. You will sow your seed in
vain, because your enemies will eat it. And I will set My face
against you, so that you will be defeated by your enemies. Those who
hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one pursues
you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And if after all this you will not obey
Me, I will proceed to punish you sevenfold for your sins. I will
break down your stubborn pride and make your sky like iron and your
land like bronze, and your strength will be spent in vain. For your
land will not yield its produce, and the trees of the land will not
bear their fruit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If you walk in hostility toward Me and
refuse to obey Me, I will multiply your plagues seven times,
according to your sins. I will send wild animals against you to rob
you of your children, destroy your livestock, and reduce your
numbers, until your roads lie desolate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And if in spite of these things you do not
accept My discipline, but continue to walk in hostility toward Me,
then I will act with hostility toward you, and I will strike you
sevenfold for your sins. And I will bring a sword against you to
execute the vengeance of the covenant. Though you withdraw into your
cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be delivered
into the hand of the enemy. When I cut off your supply of bread, ten
women will bake your bread in a single oven and dole out your bread
by weight, so that you will eat but not be satisfied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if in spite of all this you do not
obey Me, but continue to walk in hostility toward Me, then I will
walk in fury against you, and I, even I, will punish you sevenfold
for your sins. You will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters.
I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars, and
heap your lifeless bodies on the lifeless remains of your idols; and
My soul will despise you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I will reduce your cities to rubble and
lay waste your sanctuaries, and I will refuse to smell the pleasing
aroma of your sacrifices. And I will lay waste the land, so that your
enemies who dwell in it will be appalled. But I will scatter you
among the nations and will draw out a sword after you as your land
becomes desolate and your cities are laid waste. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths all
the days it lies desolate, while you are in the land of your enemies.
At that time the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths. As long as it
lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not receive during
the Sabbaths when you lived in it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for those of you who survive, I will
send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, so
that even the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight. And
they will flee as one flees the sword, and fall when no one pursues
them. They will stumble over one another as before the sword, though
no one is behind them. So you will not be able to stand against your
enemies. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You will perish among the nations, and the
land of your enemies will consume you. Those of you who survive in
the lands of your enemies will waste away in their iniquity and will
decay in the sins of their fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if they will confess their iniquity
and that of their fathers in the unfaithfulness that they practiced
against Me, by which they have also walked in hostility toward Me—
and I acted with hostility toward them and brought them into the land
of their enemies—and if their uncircumcised hearts will be humbled
and they will make amends for their iniquity, then I will remember My
covenant with Jacob and My covenant with Isaac and My covenant with
Abraham, and I will remember the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the land will be abandoned by them,
and it will enjoy its Sabbaths by lying desolate without them. And
they will pay the penalty for their iniquity, because they rejected
My ordinances and abhorred My statutes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet in spite of this, when they are in the
land of their enemies, I will not reject or despise them so as to
destroy them and break My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their
God. But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their
fathers, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the
nations, that I might be their God. I am the LORD.” </font>
