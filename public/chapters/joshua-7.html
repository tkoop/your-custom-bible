<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Defeat at Ai</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>The Israelites, however, acted unfaithfully regarding the things devoted to destruction.<span class="fn">a</span>  Achan<span class="fn">b</span>  son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi,<span class="fn">c</span>  the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of what was set apart. So the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against the Israelites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Meanwhile, Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>On returning to Joshua, they reported, “There is no need to send all the people; two or three thousand men are enough to go up and attack Ai. Since the people of Ai are so few, you need not wear out all our people there.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So about three thousand men went up, but they fled before the men of Ai.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of them, chasing them from the gate as far as the quarries<span class="fn">d</span>  and striking them down on the slopes. So the hearts of the people melted and became like water.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown before the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> until evening, as did the elders of Israel; and they all sprinkled dust on their heads.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>“O, Lord GOD,” Joshua said, “why did <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to be destroyed? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!
<span class="reftext">8</span>O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has turned its back and run from its enemies?
<span class="reftext">9</span>When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this, they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. Then what will <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> do for <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> great name?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why have you fallen on your face?
<span class="reftext">11</span>Israel has sinned; they have transgressed <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> covenant that I commanded them, and they have taken some of what was devoted to destruction. Indeed, they have stolen and lied, and they have put these things with their own possessions.
<span class="reftext">12</span>This is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies. They will turn their backs and run from their enemies, because they themselves have been set apart for destruction. I will no longer be with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> unless <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> remove from among you whatever is devoted to destruction.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Get up and consecrate the people, saying, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says: Among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, O Israel, there are things devoted to destruction. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them.
<span class="reftext">14</span>In the morning <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> selects shall come forward clan by clan, and the clan that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> selects shall come forward family by family, and the family that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> selects shall come forward man by man.
<span class="reftext">15</span>The one who is caught with the things devoted to destruction must be burned, along with all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and committed an outrage in Israel.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Sin of Achan</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So Joshua arose early the next morning and had Israel come forward tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected.
<span class="reftext">17</span>He had the clans of Judah come forward, and the clan of the Zerahites was selected. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward, and the family of Zabdi was selected.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And he had the family of Zabdi come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, and make a confession to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. I urge you to tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>“It is true,” Achan replied, “I have sinned against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel. This is what I did:
<span class="reftext">21</span>When I saw among the spoils a beautiful cloak from Shinar,<span class="fn">e</span>  two hundred shekels of silver,<span class="fn">f</span>  and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels,<span class="fn">g</span>  I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent, and there it all was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.
<span class="reftext">23</span>They took the things from inside the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his oxen and donkeys and sheep, his tent, and everything else he owned, and brought them to the <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span> of Achor.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>“Why have you brought this trouble upon us?” said Joshua. “Today <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will bring trouble upon you!” And all Israel stoned him to death. Then they stoned the others and burned their bodies.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And they heaped over Achan a large pile of rocks that remains to this day. So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> turned from <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> burning anger. Therefore that place is called the <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span> of Achor<span class="fn">h</span>  to this day.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">cherem</i> refer to the giving over of things or persons to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in verses 11, 12, 13, and 15.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Achan</i> means <i class="calibre6">troubler</i>; also called <i class="calibre6">Achar</i> in 1 Chronicles 2:7.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Zabdi</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Zimri</i>; also in verses 17 and 18; see LXX and 1 Chronicles 2:6.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">as far as Shebarim</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, Babylonia <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">200 shekels</i> is approximately 5 pounds or 2.3 kilograms of silver.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">50 shekels</i> is approximately 1.26 pounds or 569.8 grams of gold.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">Achor</i> means <i class="calibre6">trouble</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
