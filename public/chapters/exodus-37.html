<font face="Tahoma, serif">Bezalel went on to construct the ark of
acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and
a cubit and a half high. He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside
and out, and made a gold molding around it. And he cast four gold
rings for its four feet, two rings on one side and two on the other.
Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. He
inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark in order to
carry it. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He constructed a mercy seat of pure gold,
two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide. He made two
cherubim of hammered gold at the ends of the mercy seat, one cherub
on one end and one on the other, all made from one piece of gold. And
the cherubim had wings that spread upward, overshadowing the mercy
seat. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the mercy seat. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He also made the table of acacia wood two
cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high. He overlaid
it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it. And he made a
rim around it a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">He cast four gold rings for the table and
fastened them to the four corners at its four legs. The rings were
placed close to the rim, to serve as holders for the poles used to
carry the table. He made the poles of acacia wood for carrying the
table and overlaid them with gold. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then he made the lampstand out of pure
hammered gold, all of one piece: its base and shaft, its cups, and
its buds and petals. Six branches extended from the sides, three on
one side and three on the other. There were three cups shaped like
almond blossoms on the first branch, each with buds and petals, three
on the next branch, and the same for all six branches that extended
from the lampstand. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And on the lampstand were four cups shaped
like almond blossoms with buds and petals. A bud was under the first
pair of branches that extended from the lampstand, a bud under the
second pair, and a bud under the third pair. The buds and branches
were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">He made the altar of incense out of acacia
wood. It was square, a cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits high.
Its horns were of one piece. And he overlaid with pure gold the top
and all the sides and horns. Then he made a molding of gold around
it. </font>
