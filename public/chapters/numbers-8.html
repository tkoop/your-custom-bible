<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
Aaron and tell him: ‘When you set up the seven lamps, they are to
light the area in front of the lampstand.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And Aaron did so; he set up the lamps
facing toward the front of the lampstand, just as the LORD had
commanded Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >This is how the lampstand was constructed:
it was made of hammered gold from its base to its blossoms, fashioned
according to the pattern the LORD had shown Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
“Take the Levites from among the Israelites and make them
ceremonially clean. This is what you must do to cleanse them:
Sprinkle them with the water of purification. Have them shave their
whole bodies and wash their clothes, and so purify themselves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then have them take a young bull with its
grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you are to take a
second young bull for a sin offering. Bring the Levites before the
Tent of Meeting and assemble the whole congregation of Israel. You
are to present the Levites before the LORD and have the Israelites
lay their hands upon them. Aaron is to present the Levites before the
LORD as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, so that they may
perform the service of the LORD. And the Levites are to lay their
hands on the heads of the bulls, and offer to the LORD one as a sin
offering and the other as a burnt offering, to make atonement for the
Levites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >You are to have the Levites stand before
Aaron and his sons and then present them before the LORD as a wave
offering. In this way you shall separate the Levites from the rest of
the Israelites, and the Levites will belong to Me. After you have
cleansed them and presented them as a wave offering, they may come to
serve at the Tent of Meeting. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >For the Levites have been wholly given to
Me from among the sons of Israel. I have taken them for Myself in
place of all who come first from the womb, the firstborn of all the
sons of Israel. For every firstborn male in Israel is Mine, both man
and beast. I set them apart for Myself on the day I struck down all
the firstborn in the land of Egypt. But I have taken the Levites in
place of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel. And I have given
the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the
Israelites, to perform the service for the Israelites at the Tent of
Meeting and to make atonement on their behalf, so that no plague will
come against the Israelites when they approach the sanctuary.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Moses, Aaron, and the whole
congregation of Israel did with the Levites everything that the LORD
had commanded Moses they should do. The Levites purified themselves
and washed their clothes, and Aaron presented them as a wave offering
before the LORD. Aaron also made atonement for them to cleanse them.
After that, the Levites came to perform their service at the Tent of
Meeting in the presence of Aaron and his sons. Thus they did with the
Levites just as the LORD had commanded Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “This
applies to the Levites: Men twenty-five years of age or older shall
enter to perform the service in the work at the Tent of Meeting. But
at the age of fifty, they must retire from performing the work and no
longer serve. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >After that, they may assist their brothers
in fulfilling their duties at the Tent of Meeting, but they
themselves are not to do the work. This is how you are to assign
responsibilities to the Levites.” </font>
