They are to eat the offerings made by fire to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>; that is their inheritance.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Although they have no inheritance among their brothers, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is their inheritance, as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> promised them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>This shall be the priests’ share from the people who offer a sacrifice, whether a bull or a sheep: the priests are to be given the shoulder, the jowls, and the stomach.
<span class="reftext">4</span>You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the first wool sheared from your flock.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has chosen Levi and his sons out of all your tribes to stand and minister in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> name for all time.

<span class="reftext">8</span>They shall eat equal portions, even though he has received money from the sale of his father’s estate.

<span class="reftext">10</span>Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire,<span class="fn">a</span>  practices divination or conjury, interprets omens, practices sorcery,

<span class="reftext">12</span>For whoever does these things is detestable to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. And because of these detestable things, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is driving out the nations before you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>You must be blameless before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.

<span class="reftext">16</span>This is what you asked of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God at Horeb<span class="fn">c</span>  on the day of the assembly, when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God or see this great fire anymore, so that we will not die!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me, “They have spoken well.
<span class="reftext">18</span>I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. I will put <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him.
<span class="reftext">19</span>And I will hold accountable anyone who does not listen to <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> words that the prophet speaks in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">20</span>But if any prophet dares to speak a message in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name that I have not commanded him to speak, or to speak in the name of other gods, that prophet must be put to death.”

<span class="reftext">22</span>When a prophet speaks in the name of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and the message does not come to pass or come true, that is a message <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has not spoken.
