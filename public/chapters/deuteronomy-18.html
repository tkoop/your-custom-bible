<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Levitical priests—indeed the whole
tribe of Levi—shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel.
They are to eat the offerings made by fire to the LORD; that is their
inheritance. Although they have no inheritance among their brothers,
the LORD is their inheritance, as He promised them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This shall be the priests’ share from
the people who offer a sacrifice, whether a bull or a sheep: the
priests are to be given the shoulder, the jowls, and the stomach. You
are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine, and oil,
and the first wool sheared from your flock. For the LORD your God has
chosen Levi and his sons out of all your tribes to stand and minister
in His name for all time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now if a Levite moves from any town of
residence throughout Israel and comes in all earnestness to the place
the LORD will choose, then he shall serve in the name of the LORD his
God like all his fellow Levites who stand there before the LORD. They
shall eat equal portions, even though he has received money from the
sale of his father’s estate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When you enter the land that the LORD your
God is giving you, do not imitate the detestable ways of the nations
there. Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or
daughter in the fire, practices divination or conjury, interprets
omens, practices sorcery, casts spells, consults a medium or
spiritist, or inquires of the dead. For whoever does these things is
detestable to the LORD. And because of these detestable things, the
LORD your God is driving out the nations before you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You must be blameless before the LORD your
God. Though these nations, which you will dispossess, listen to
conjurers and diviners, the LORD your God has not permitted you to do
so. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD your God will raise up for you a
prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to him.
This is what you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of
the assembly, when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the LORD
our God or see this great fire anymore, so that we will not die!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to me, “They have
spoken well. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among
their brothers. I will put My words in his mouth, and he will tell
them everything I command him. And I will hold accountable anyone who
does not listen to My words that the prophet speaks in My name. But
if any prophet dares to speak a message in My name that I have not
commanded him to speak, or to speak in the name of other gods, that
prophet must be put to death.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You may ask in your heart, “How can we
recognize a message that the LORD has not spoken?” When a prophet
speaks in the name of the LORD and the message does not come to pass
or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. The prophet
has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him. </font>
