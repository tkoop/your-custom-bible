<span class="reftext">6</span>and the Horites in the area of Mount Seir, as far as El-paran, which is near the desert.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then they turned back to invade En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.

<span class="reftext">12</span>They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since Lot was living in Sodom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then an escapee came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew.
