<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font ><b>The War of the Kings</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In those days Amraphel king of Shinar,
Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of
Goiim went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of
Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the
king of Bela (that is, Zoar). </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The latter five came as allies to the
Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). For twelve years they had
been subject to Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they
rebelled. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and
the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in
Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in
Shaveh-kiriathaim, and the Horites in the area of Mount Seir, as far
as El-paran, which is near the desert. Then they turned back to
invade En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole
territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who lived in
Hazazon-tamar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king of Sodom, the king of
Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of
Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and arrayed themselves for battle in
the Valley of Siddim against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of
Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four
kings against five. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar
pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some men fell into
the pits, but the survivors fled to the hill country. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The four kings seized all the goods of
Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food, and they went on their way.
They also carried off Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since
Lot was living in Sodom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then an escapee came and reported this to
Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the Oaks of Mamre the
Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and Aner, all of whom were bound by
treaty to Abram. And when Abram heard that his relative had been
captured, he mobilized the 318 trained men born in his household, and
they set out in pursuit as far as Dan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >During the night, Abram divided his forces
and routed Chedorlaomer’s army, pursuing them as far as Hobah,
north of Damascus. He retrieved all the goods, as well as his
relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the
rest of the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Abram returned from defeating
Chedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom went
out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s
Valley). </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out
bread and wine—since he was priest of God Most High — and he
blessed Abram and said: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Blessed be Abram by God Most High, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Creator of heaven and earth, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and blessed be God Most High, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >who has delivered your enemies into your
hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of
everything. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give
me the people, but take the goods for yourself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Abram replied to the king of Sodom, “I
have raised my hand to the LORD God Most High, Creator of heaven and
earth, that I will not accept even a thread, or a strap of a sandal,
or anything that belongs to you, lest you should say, ‘I have made
Abram rich.’ I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and
the share for the men who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre.
They may take their portion.” </font>
