“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Son of man,” He said to me, “eat

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then He said to me, “Son of man, go now
to the house of Israel and speak My words to them. For you are not
being sent to a people of unfamiliar speech or difficult language,
but to the house of Israel— not to the many peoples of unfamiliar
speech and difficult language whose words you cannot understand.
Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the house of Israel will be unwilling
to listen to you, since they are unwilling to listen to Me. For the
whole house of Israel is hard-headed and hard-hearted. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Behold, I will make your face as hard as
their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads. I will
make your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Do not be
afraid of them or dismayed at their presence, even though they are a
rebellious house.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Son of man,” He added, “listen
carefully to all the words I speak to you, and take them to heart. Go
to your people, the exiles; speak to them and tell them, ‘This is
what the Lord GOD says,’ whether they listen or refuse to listen.”

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard
a great rumbling sound behind me: ‘Blessed be the glory of the LORD
in His dwelling place!’ It was the sound of the wings of the living
creatures brushing against one another and the sound of the wheels
beside them, a great rumbling sound. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the Spirit lifted me up and took me
away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with
the strong hand of the LORD upon me. I came to the exiles at Tel-abib
who dwelt by the River Kebar. And for seven days I sat where they sat
and remained there among them, overwhelmed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At the end of seven days the word of the
LORD came to me, saying, “Son of man, I have made you a watchman
for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from My mouth, give
them a warning from Me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If I say to the wicked man, ‘You will
surely die,’ but you do not warn him or speak out to warn him from
his wicked way to save his life, that wicked man will die in his
iniquity, and I will hold you responsible for his blood. But if you
warn a wicked man and he does not turn from his wickedness and his
wicked way, he will die in his iniquity, but you will have saved
yourself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now if a righteous man turns from his
righteousness and commits iniquity, and I put a stumbling block
before him, he will die. If you did not warn him, he will die in his
sin, and the righteous acts he did will not be remembered. And I will
hold you responsible for his blood. But if you warn the righteous man
not to sin, and he does not sin, he will indeed live because he
heeded your warning, and you will have saved yourself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And there the hand of the LORD was upon
me, and He said to me, “Get up, go out to the plain, and there I
will speak with you.” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I got up and went out to the plain, and
behold, the glory of the LORD was present there, like the glory I had
seen by the River Kebar, and I fell facedown. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Spirit entered me and set me on
my feet. He spoke with me and said, “Go, shut yourself inside your
house. And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes, and you will be
bound so that you cannot go out among the people. I will make your
tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, and you will be silent and
unable to rebuke them, though they are a rebellious house. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when I speak with you, I will open
your mouth, and you are to tell them, ‘This is what the Lord GOD
says.’ Whoever listens, let him listen; and whoever refuses, let
him refuse, for they are a rebellious house. </font>
