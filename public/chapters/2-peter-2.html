They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Many will follow in their depravity, and because of them the way of truth will be defamed.
<span class="reftext">3</span>In their greed, these false teachers will exploit <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> with deceptive words. The longstanding verdict against them remains in force, and their destruction does not sleep.

<span class="reftext">9</span>if all this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Such punishment is specially reserved for those who indulge the corrupt desires of the flesh and despise authority. Bold and self-willed, they are unafraid to slander glorious beings.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Yet not even angels, though greater in strength and power, dare to bring such slanderous charges against them before the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>These men are like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be captured and destroyed. They blaspheme in matters they do not understand, and like such creatures, they too will be destroyed.
<span class="reftext">13</span>The harm they will suffer is the wages of their wickedness. </p><p class="reg1"> They consider it a pleasure to carouse in broad daylight.

<span class="reftext">16</span>But he was rebuked for his transgression by a donkey, otherwise without speech, that spoke with a man’s voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>These men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.
<span class="reftext">18</span>With lofty but empty words, they appeal to the sensual passions of the flesh and entice those who are just escaping from others who live in error.
<span class="reftext">19</span>They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to depravity. For a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him.

<span class="reftext">21</span>It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to have known it and then to turn away from the holy commandment passed on to them.
