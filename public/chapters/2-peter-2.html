<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Deliverance from False Prophets</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now there were also false prophets among
the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will
secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the Master who
bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves. Many will
follow in their depravity, and because of them the way of truth will
be defamed. In their greed, these false teachers will exploit you
with deceptive words. The longstanding verdict against them remains
in force, and their destruction does not sleep. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For if God did not spare the angels when
they sinned, but cast them deep into hell, placing them in chains of
darkness to be held for judgment; if He did not spare the ancient
world when He brought the flood on its ungodly people, but preserved
Noah, a preacher of righteousness, among the eight; if He condemned
the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction, reducing them to
ashes as an example of what is coming on the ungodly; and if He
rescued Lot, a righteous man distressed by the depraved conduct of
the lawless (for that righteous man, living among them day after day,
was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and
heard)— if all this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue the
godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the
day of judgment. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Such punishment is specially reserved for
those who indulge the corrupt desires of the flesh and despise
authority. Bold and self-willed, they are unafraid to slander
glorious beings. Yet not even angels, though greater in strength and
power, dare to bring such slanderous charges against them before the
Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">These men are like irrational animals,
creatures of instinct, born to be captured and destroyed. They
blaspheme in matters they do not understand, and like such creatures,
they too will be destroyed. The harm they will suffer is the wages of
their wickedness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They consider it a pleasure to carouse in
broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their
deception as they feast with you. Their eyes are full of adultery;
their desire for sin is never satisfied; they seduce the unstable.
They are accursed children with hearts trained in greed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They have left the straight way and
wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved the
wages of wickedness. But he was rebuked for his transgression by a
donkey, otherwise without speech, that spoke with a man’s voice and
restrained the prophet’s madness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">These men are springs without water and
mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them. With
lofty but empty words, they appeal to the sensual passions of the
flesh and entice those who are just escaping from others who live in
error. They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves to
depravity. For a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If indeed they have escaped the corruption
of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ, only to be entangled and overcome by it again, their final
condition is worse than it was at first. It would have been better
for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to have
known it and then to turn away from the holy commandment passed on to
them. Of them the proverbs are true: “A dog returns to its vomit,”
and, “A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud.”
