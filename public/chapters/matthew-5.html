body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your
right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is

it is His footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great
King. Nor should you swear by your head, for you cannot make a single
hair white or black. Simply let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your

forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who
asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from
you. </font></font>

the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you

your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even
Gentiles do the same? </font></font>
