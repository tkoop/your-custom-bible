<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Sermon on the Mount</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When Jesus saw the crowds, He went up on the mountain and sat down. His disciples came to Him,
<span class="reftext">2</span>and He began to teach them, saying:
</p><p class="hdg">The Beatitudes<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 1:1–6; Luke 6:20–23)</span></p><p class="indent1stlinered"><span class="reftext">3</span>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, </p><p class="indentred"> for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Blessed are those who mourn, </p><p class="indentred"> for they will be comforted.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Blessed are the meek, </p><p class="indentred"> for they will inherit the earth.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, </p><p class="indentred"> for they will be filled.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Blessed are the merciful, </p><p class="indentred"> for they will be shown mercy.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Blessed are the pure in heart, </p><p class="indentred"> for they will see God.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Blessed are the peacemakers, </p><p class="indentred"> for they will be called sons of God.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, </p><p class="indentred"> for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">11</span>Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you.
</p><p class="hdg">Salt and Light<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 9:49–50; Luke 14:34–35; Philippians 2:12–18)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">13</span>You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its savour, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">14</span>You are the light of the world. A city on a hill<span class="fn">b</span>  cannot be hidden.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead, they set it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
<span class="reftext">16</span>In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.
</p><p class="hdg">The Fulfillment of the Law</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">17</span>Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For I tell you truly, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single jot, not a stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">19</span>So then, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do likewise will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
<span class="reftext">20</span>For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
</p><p class="hdg">Anger and Reconciliation<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 12:57–59)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">21</span>You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not murder’<span class="fn">c</span>  and ‘Anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’
<span class="reftext">22</span>But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother<span class="fn">d</span>  will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, ‘Raca,’<span class="fn">e</span>  will be subject to the Sanhedrin.<span class="fn">f</span>  But anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to the fire of hell.<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">23</span>So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
<span class="reftext">24</span>leave your gift there before the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">25</span>Reconcile quickly with your adversary, while you are still on the way to court. Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.<span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Adultery<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Leviticus 18:1–30)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">27</span>You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’<span class="fn">i</span> 
<span class="reftext">28</span>But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
<span class="reftext">29</span>If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.<span class="fn">j</span> 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to depart into hell.
</p><p class="hdg">Divorce<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 24:1–5; Luke 16:18)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>It has also been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’<span class="fn">k</span> 
<span class="reftext">32</span>But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, brings adultery upon her.<span class="fn">l</span>  And he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
</p><p class="hdg">Oaths and Vows<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 30:1–16)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">33</span>Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfill your vows to the Lord.’<span class="fn">m</span> 
<span class="reftext">34</span>But I tell you not to swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God’s throne;
<span class="reftext">35</span>or by the earth, for it is His footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Nor should you swear by your head, for you cannot make a single hair white or black.
<span class="reftext">37</span>Simply let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ Anything more comes from the evil one.<span class="fn">n</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Love Your Enemies<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Leviticus 24:17–23; Luke 6:27–36)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">38</span>You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.’<span class="fn">o</span> 
<span class="reftext">39</span>But I tell you not to resist an evil person. If someone slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also;
<span class="reftext">40</span>if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well;
<span class="reftext">41</span>and if someone forces you to go one mile,<span class="fn">p</span>  go with him two miles.<span class="fn">q</span> 
<span class="reftext">42</span>Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">43</span>You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbour’<span class="fn">r</span>  and ‘Hate your enemy.’
<span class="reftext">44</span>But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,<span class="fn">s</span> 
<span class="reftext">45</span>that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
<span class="reftext">46</span>If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Do not even tax collectors do the same?
<span class="reftext">47</span>And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even Gentiles do the same?
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">48</span>Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Blessed are those who exercise strength under control, for they will inherit the land</i>; see Psalm 37:11.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">A city lying on a hill</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">without cause</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Raca</i> is an Aramaic expression of contempt.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Council</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the hell of fire</i>; Greek <i class="calibre6">the Gehenna of fire</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">kodrantēn</i>; that is, a Roman copper coin worth about 1-64 of a denarius<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">29</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">Gehenna</i>; also in verse 30<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Deuteronomy 24:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">32</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> Or <i class="calibre6">causes her to commit adultery</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">m</span> Numbers 30:2<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">37</span> <span class="footnotesbot">n</span> Or <i class="calibre6">from evil</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">38</span> <span class="footnotesbot">o</span> Exodus 21:24; Leviticus 24:20; Deuteronomy 19:21<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">41</span> <span class="footnotesbot">p</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">one milion</i>; that is, a Roman mile, approximately 4,855 feet or 1,480 meters<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">41</span> <span class="footnotesbot">q</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">go with him two.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">43</span> <span class="footnotesbot">r</span> Leviticus 19:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">44</span> <span class="footnotesbot">s</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully accuse you and persecute you</i>; see Luke 6:27–28.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
