<font ><b>Seeking Vashti’s Successor</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some time later, when the anger of King
Xerxes had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done, and
what had been decreed against her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king’s attendants proposed,
“Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king, and
let the king appoint commissioners in each province of his kingdom to
assemble all the beautiful young women into the harem at the citadel
of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king’s
eunuch in charge of the women, and let them be given beauty
treatments. Then let the young woman who pleases the king become
queen in place of Vashti.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This suggestion pleased the king, and he
acted accordingly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now there was at the citadel of Susa a
Jewish man from the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai son of Jair, the
son of Shimei, the son of Kish. He had been carried into exile from
Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon among those taken captive
with Jeconiah king of Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah (that
is, Esther), the daughter of his uncle, because she did not have a
father or mother. The young woman was lovely in form and appearance,
and when her father and mother had died, Mordecai had taken her in as
his own daughter. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the king’s command and edict had
been proclaimed, many young women gathered at the citadel of Susa
under the care of Hegai. Esther was also taken to the palace and
placed under the care of Hegai, the custodian of the women. And the
young woman pleased him and obtained his favor, so he quickly
provided her with beauty treatments and the special diet. He assigned
to her seven select maidservants from the palace and transferred her
with them to the best place in the harem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Esther did not reveal her people or her
lineage, because Mordecai had instructed her not to do so. And every
day Mordecai would walk back and forth in front of the court of the
harem to learn about Esther’s welfare and what was happening to
her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the twelve months before her turn to go
to King Xerxes, the harem regulation required each young woman to
receive beauty treatments with oil of myrrh for six months, and then
with perfumes and cosmetics for another six months. When the young
woman would go to the king, she was given whatever she requested to
take with her from the harem to the king’s palace. She would go
there in the evening, and in the morning she would return to a second
harem under the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch in charge of
the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he delighted
in her and summoned her by name. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Esther was the daughter of Abihail,
the uncle from whom Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter. And
when it was her turn to go to the king, she did not ask for anything
except what Hegai, the king’s trusted official in charge of the
harem, had advised. And Esther found favor in the eyes of everyone
who saw her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal
palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year
of his reign. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the king loved Esther more than all
the other women, and she found grace and favor in his sight more than
all of the other virgins. So he placed the royal crown upon her head
and made her queen in place of Vashti. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king held a great banquet,
Esther’s banquet, for all his officials and servants. He proclaimed
a tax holiday in the provinces and gave gifts worthy of the king’s
bounty. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the virgins were assembled a second
time, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate. Esther still had not
revealed her lineage or her people, just as Mordecai had instructed.
She obeyed Mordecai’s command, as she had done under his care. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In those days, while Mordecai was sitting
at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs
who guarded the entrance, grew angry and conspired to assassinate
King Xerxes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Mordecai learned of the plot, he
reported it to Queen Esther, and she informed the king on Mordecai’s
behalf. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After the report had been investigated and
verified, both officials were hanged on the gallows. And all this was
recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king. </font>
