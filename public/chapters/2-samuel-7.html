<font ><b>David’s Prayer of Thanksgiving</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After the king had settled into his palace
and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him, he
said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar,
while the ark of God remains in a tent.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Nathan replied to the king, “Go and
do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But that night the word of the LORD came
to Nathan, saying, “Go and tell My servant David that this is what
the LORD says: Are you the one to build for Me a house to dwell in?
For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites
up out of Egypt until this day, but I have moved about with a tent as
My dwelling. In all My journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever
asked any of the leaders I appointed to shepherd My people Israel,
‘Why haven’t you built Me a house of cedar?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now then, you are to tell My servant David
that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the
pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over My people
Israel. I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut
off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name
like the greatest in the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And I will provide a place for My people
Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their
own and be disturbed no more. No longer will the sons of wickedness
oppress them as they did at the beginning and have done since the day
I appointed judges over My people Israel. I will give you rest from
all your enemies. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD declares to you that He Himself
will establish a house for you. And when your days are fulfilled and
you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after
you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his
kingdom. He will build a house for My Name, and I will establish the
throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his Father, and he will be
My son. When he does wrong, I will discipline him with the rod of men
and with the blows of the sons of men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But My loving devotion will never be
removed from him as I removed it from Saul, whom I moved out of your
way. Your house and kingdom will endure forever before Me, and your
throne will be established forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Nathan relayed to David all the words
of this entire vision. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then King David went in, sat before the
LORD, and said, “Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that
You have brought me this far? And as if this was a small thing in
Your eyes, O Lord GOD, You have also spoken about the future of the
house of Your servant. Is this Your custom with man, O Lord GOD? What
more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, O Lord GOD. For
the sake of Your word and according to Your own heart, You have
accomplished this great thing and revealed it to Your servant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >How great You are, O Lord GOD! For there
is none like You, and there is no God but You, according to
everything we have heard with our own ears. And who is like Your
people Israel—the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem
as a people for Himself and to make a name for Himself? You performed
great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from
before Your people, whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt. For
You have established Your people Israel as Your very own forever, and
You, O LORD, have become their God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now, O LORD God, confirm forever the
word You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house. Do as You
have promised, so that Your name will be magnified forever when it is
said, ‘The LORD of Hosts is God over Israel.’ And the house of
Your servant David will be established before You. For You, O LORD of
Hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed this to Your servant when You
said, ‘I will build a house for you.’ Therefore Your servant has
found the courage to offer this prayer to You. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now, O Lord GOD, You are God! Your
words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant.
Now therefore, may it please You to bless the house of Your servant,
that it may continue forever before You. For You, O Lord GOD, have
spoken, and with Your blessing the house of Your servant will be
blessed forever.” </font>
