<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">God’s Covenant with David<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 17:1–15)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After the king had settled into his palace and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him,
<span class="reftext">2</span>he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And Nathan replied to the king, “Go and do all that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But that night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,
<span class="reftext">5</span>“Go and tell My servant David that this is what the LORD says: Are you the one to build for Me a house to dwell in?
<span class="reftext">6</span>For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt until this day, but I have moved about with a tent as My dwelling.
<span class="reftext">7</span>In all My journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever asked any of the leaders<span class="fn">a</span>  I appointed to shepherd My people Israel, ‘Why haven’t you built Me a house of cedar?’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Now then, you are to tell My servant David that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over My people Israel.
<span class="reftext">9</span>I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name like the greatest in the land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And I will provide a place for My people Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their own and be disturbed no more. No longer will the sons of wickedness oppress them as they did at the beginning
<span class="reftext">11</span>and have done since the day I appointed judges over My people Israel. I will give you rest from all your enemies. </p><p class="reg1"> The LORD declares to you that He Himself will establish a house for you.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And when your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He will build a house for My Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
<span class="reftext">14</span>I will be his Father, and he will be My son.<span class="fn">b</span>  When he does wrong, I will discipline him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>But My loving devotion will never be removed from him as I removed it from Saul, whom I moved out of your way.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Your house and kingdom will endure forever before Me,<span class="fn">c</span>  and your throne will be established forever.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So Nathan relayed to David all the words of this entire vision.
</p><p class="hdg">David’s Prayer of Thanksgiving<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 17:16–27)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then King David went in, sat before the LORD, and said, “Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house, that You have brought me this far?
<span class="reftext">19</span>And as if this was a small thing in Your eyes, O Lord GOD, You have also spoken about the future of the house of Your servant. Is this Your custom with man, O Lord GOD?<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">20</span>What more can David say to You? For You know Your servant, O Lord GOD.
<span class="reftext">21</span>For the sake of Your word and according to Your own heart, You have accomplished this great thing and revealed it to Your servant.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>How great You are, O Lord GOD! For there is none like You, and there is no God but You, according to everything we have heard with our own ears.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And who is like Your people Israel—the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself and to make a name for Himself? You performed great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before Your people, whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">24</span>For You have established Your people Israel as Your very own forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>And now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house. Do as You have promised,
<span class="reftext">26</span>so that Your name will be magnified forever when it is said, ‘The LORD of Hosts is God over Israel.’ And the house of Your servant David will be established before You.
<span class="reftext">27</span>For You, O LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed this to Your servant when You said, ‘I will build a house for you.’ Therefore Your servant has found the courage to offer this prayer to You.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>And now, O Lord GOD, You are God! Your words are true, and You have promised this goodness to Your servant.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Now therefore, may it please You to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever before You. For You, O Lord GOD, have spoken, and with Your blessing the house of Your servant will be blessed forever.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">tribes</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Cited in Hebrews 1:5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Some Hebrew manuscripts and LXX; most Hebrew manuscripts <i class="calibre6">you</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">And this is Your instruction for mankind, O Lord GOD.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> See LXX and 1 Chronicles 17:21; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">You performed for Yourself great and awesome wonders for Your land, before Your people, whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, from nations and their gods.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
