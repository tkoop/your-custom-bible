<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Judging Others<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 6:37–42; Romans 14:1–12)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">1</span>“Do not judge, or you will be judged.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For with the same judgment you pronounce, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">3</span>Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?
<span class="reftext">4</span>How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ while there is still a beam in your own eye?
<span class="reftext">5</span>You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">6</span>Do not give dogs what is holy; do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.
</p><p class="hdg">Ask, Seek, Knock<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 11:5–13)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">7</span>Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.
<span class="reftext">8</span>For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">9</span>Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
<span class="reftext">10</span>Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?
<span class="reftext">11</span>So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">12</span>In everything, then, do to others as you would have them do to you. For this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets.
</p><p class="hdg">The Narrow Gate<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 13:22–30)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">13</span>Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it.
</p><p class="hdg">A Tree and Its Fruit<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 6:43–45)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">15</span>Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
<span class="reftext">16</span>By their fruit you will recognize them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
<span class="reftext">17</span>Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
<span class="reftext">18</span>A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
<span class="reftext">20</span>So then, by their fruit you will recognize them.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">21</span>Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’
</p><p class="hdg">The House on the Rock<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 6:46–49)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
<span class="reftext">25</span>The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">26</span>But everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
<span class="reftext">27</span>The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell—and great was its collapse!”
</p><p class="hdg">The Authority of Jesus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were astonished at His teaching,
<span class="reftext">29</span>because He taught as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
