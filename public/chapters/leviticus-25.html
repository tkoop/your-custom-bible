<font ><b>The Year of Jubilee</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses on Mount
Sinai, “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the
land that I am giving you, the land itself must observe a Sabbath to
the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For six years you may sow your field and
prune your vineyard and gather its crops. But in the seventh year
there shall be a Sabbath of complete rest for the land—a Sabbath to
the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are not to sow your field or prune
your vineyard. You are not to reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or
gather the grapes of your untended vines. The land must have a year
of complete rest. Whatever the land yields during the Sabbath year
shall be food for you—for yourself, your manservant and
maidservant, the hired hand or foreigner who stays with you, and for
your livestock and the wild animals in your land. All its growth may
serve as food. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you shall count off seven Sabbaths of
years—seven times seven years—so that the seven Sabbaths of years
amount to forty-nine years. Then you are to sound the horn far and
wide on the tenth day of the seventh month, the Day of Atonement. You
shall sound it throughout your land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So you are to consecrate the fiftieth year
and proclaim liberty in the land for all its inhabitants. It shall be
your Jubilee, when each of you is to return to his property and to
his clan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The fiftieth year will be a Jubilee for
you; you are not to sow the land or reap its aftergrowth or harvest
the untended vines. For it is a Jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You
may eat only the crops taken directly from the field. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In this Year of Jubilee, each of you shall
return to his own property. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If you make a sale to your neighbor or a
purchase from him, you must not take advantage of each other. You are
to buy from your neighbor according to the number of years since the
last Jubilee; he is to sell to you according to the number of harvest
years remaining. You shall increase the price in proportion to a
greater number of years, or decrease it in proportion to a lesser
number of years; for he is selling you a given number of harvests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not take advantage of each other, but
fear your God; for I am the LORD your God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are to keep My statutes and carefully
observe My judgments, so that you may dwell securely in the land.
Then the land will yield its fruit, so that you can eat your fill and
dwell in safety in the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now you may wonder, ‘What will we eat in
the seventh year if we do not sow or gather our produce?’ But I
will send My blessing upon you in the sixth year, so that the land
will yield a crop sufficient for three years. While you are sowing in
the eighth year, you will be eating from the previous harvest, until
the ninth year’s harvest comes in. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The land must not be sold permanently,
because it is Mine, and you are but foreigners and residents with Me.
Thus for every piece of property you possess, you must provide for
the redemption of the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If your brother becomes impoverished and
sells some of his property, his nearest of kin may come and redeem
what his brother has sold. Or if a man has no one to redeem it for
him, but he prospers and acquires enough to redeem his land, he shall
calculate the years since its sale, repay the balance to the man to
whom he sold it, and return to his property. But if he cannot obtain
enough to repay him, what he sold will remain in possession of the
buyer until the Year of Jubilee. In the Jubilee, however, it is to be
released, so that he may return to his property. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If a man sells a house in a walled city,
he retains his right of redemption until a full year after its sale;
during that year it may be redeemed. If it is not redeemed by the end
of a full year, then the house in the walled city is permanently
transferred to its buyer and his descendants. It is not to be
released in the Jubilee. But houses in villages with no walls around
them are to be considered as open fields. They may be redeemed, and
they shall be released in the Jubilee. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the cities of the Levites, the
Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the cities
they possess. So whatever belongs to the Levites may be redeemed—a
house sold in a city they possess—and must be released in the
Jubilee, because the houses in the cities of the Levites are their
possession among the Israelites. But the open pastureland around
their cities may not be sold, for this is their permanent possession.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if your countryman becomes destitute
and cannot support himself among you, then you are to help him as you
would a foreigner or stranger, so that he can continue to live among
you. Do not take any interest or profit from him, but fear your God,
that your countryman may live among you. You must not lend him your
silver at interest or sell him your food for profit. I am the LORD
your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the
land of Canaan and to be your God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If a countryman among you becomes
destitute and sells himself to you, then you must not force him into
slave labor. Let him stay with you as a hired worker or temporary
resident; he is to work for you until the Year of Jubilee. Then he
and his children are to be released, and he may return to his clan
and to the property of his fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because the Israelites are My servants,
whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, they are not to be sold as
slaves. You are not to rule over them harshly, but you shall fear
your God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Your menservants and maidservants shall
come from the nations around you, from whom you may purchase them.
You may also purchase them from the foreigners residing among you or
their clans living among you who are born in your land. These may
become your property. You may leave them to your sons after you to
inherit as property; you can make them slaves for life. But as for
your brothers, the Israelites, no man may rule harshly over his
brother. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If a foreigner residing among you
prospers, but your countryman dwelling near him becomes destitute and
sells himself to the foreigner or to a member of his clan, he retains
the right of redemption after he has sold himself. One of his
brothers may redeem him: either his uncle or cousin or any close
relative from his clan may redeem him. Or if he prospers, he may
redeem himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He and his purchaser will then count the
time from the year he sold himself up to the Year of Jubilee. The
price of his sale will be determined by the number of years, based on
the daily wages of a hired hand. If many years remain, he must pay
for his redemption in proportion to his purchase price. If only a few
years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he is to calculate and pay
his redemption according to his remaining years. He shall be treated
like a man hired from year to year, but a foreign owner must not rule
over him harshly in your sight. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Even if he is not redeemed in any of these
ways, he and his children shall be released in the Year of Jubilee.
For the Israelites are My servants. They are My servants, whom I
brought out of the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God. </font>
