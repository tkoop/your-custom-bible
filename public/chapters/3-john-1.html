</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Beloved, I pray that in every way you may prosper and enjoy good health, as your soul also prospers.
<span class="reftext">3</span>For I was overjoyed when the brothers came and testified about your devotion to the truth, in which you continue to walk.
<span class="reftext">4</span>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
</p><p class="hdg">Gaius Commended for Hospitality</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Beloved, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers, and especially since they are strangers to you.
<span class="reftext">6</span>They have testified to the church about your love. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For they went out on behalf of the <span class='cap'>Name</span><span class='nocap'>name</span>, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers for the truth.
</p><p class="hdg">Diotrephes and Demetrius</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>I have written to the church about this,<span class="fn">a</span>  but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not accept our instruction.
<span class="reftext">10</span>So if I come, I will call attention to his malicious slander against us. And unsatisfied with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers and forbids those who want to do so, even putting them out of the church.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. We also testify for him, and you know that our testimony is true.
</p><p class="hdg">Conclusion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 John 1:12–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I have many things to write to you, but I would prefer not to do so with pen and ink.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Instead, I hope to see you soon and speak with you face to face.<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> Peace to you. </p><p class="reg1"> The friends here send you greetings. </p><p class="reg1"> Greet each of our friends there by name.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">I have written something to the church</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">and we will speak mouth to mouth</i>; some translators begin a new verse (15) after <i class="calibre6">face to face.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
