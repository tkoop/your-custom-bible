<font >Beloved, I pray that in every way you may
prosper and enjoy good health, as your soul also prospers. For I was
overjoyed when the brothers came and testified about your devotion to
the truth, in which you continue to walk. I have no greater joy than
to hear that my children are walking in the truth. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Beloved, you are faithful in what you are
doing for the brothers, and especially since they are strangers to
you. They have testified to the church about your love. You will do
well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God. For they
went out on behalf of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.
Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow
workers for the truth. </font>

<font >I have written to the church about this,
but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not accept our
instruction. So if I come, I will call attention to his malicious
slander against us. And unsatisfied with that, he refuses to welcome
the brothers and forbids those who want to do so, even putting them
out of the church. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but
what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil
has not seen God. </font>
