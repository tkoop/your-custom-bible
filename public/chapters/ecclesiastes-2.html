<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Futility of Pleasure</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy what is good!” </p><p class="reg1"> But it proved to be futile.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>I said of laughter, “It is folly,” and of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>I sought to cheer my body with wine and to embrace folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom—until I could see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I expanded my pursuits. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself.
<span class="reftext">5</span>I made gardens and parks for myself, where I planted all kinds of fruit trees.
<span class="reftext">6</span>I built reservoirs to water my groves of flourishing trees.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>I acquired menservants and maidservants, and servants were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me,
<span class="reftext">8</span>and I accumulated for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I gathered to myself male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men—many concubines.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So I became great and surpassed all in Jerusalem who had preceded me; and my wisdom remained with me.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Anything my eyes desired, I did not deny myself. I refused my heart no pleasure. For my heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Yet when I considered all the works that my hands had accomplished and what I had toiled to achieve, I found everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind; there was nothing to be gained under the sun.
</p><p class="hdg">The Wise and the Foolish</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly; for what more can the king’s successor do than what has already been accomplished?
<span class="reftext">13</span>And I saw that wisdom exceeds folly, just as light exceeds darkness:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>The wise man has eyes in his head, </p><p class="indent"> but the fool walks in darkness. </p><p class="reg1"> Yet I also came to <span class='spell ca'>realize</span><span class='spell gb'>realise</span><span class='spell us'>realize</span> that one fate overcomes them both.
<span class="reftext">15</span>So I said to myself, “The fate of the fool will also befall me. What then have I gained by being wise?” </p><p class="reg1"> And I said to myself that this too is futile.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise, just as with the fool, seeing that both will be forgotten in the days to come. Alas, the wise man will die just like the fool!
<span class="reftext">17</span>So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
</p><p class="hdg">The Futility of Work</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>I hated all for which I had toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who comes after me.
<span class="reftext">19</span>And who knows whether that man will be wise or foolish? Yet he will take over all the <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> at which I have worked skillfully under the sun. This too is futile.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So my heart began to despair over all the <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> that I had done under the sun.
<span class="reftext">21</span>When there is a man who has <span class='spell ca'>laboured</span><span class='spell gb'>laboured</span><span class='spell us'>labored</span> with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and he must give his portion to a man who has not worked for it, this too is futile and a great evil.
<span class="reftext">22</span>For what does a man get for all the toil and striving with which he <span class='spell ca'>labours</span><span class='spell gb'>labours</span><span class='spell us'>labors</span> under the sun?
<span class="reftext">23</span>Indeed, all his days are filled with grief, and his task is sorrowful; even at night, his mind does not rest. This too is futile.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Nothing is better for a man than to eat and drink and enjoy his work. I have also seen that this is from the hand of God.
<span class="reftext">25</span>For apart from Him,<span class="fn">a</span>  who can eat and who can find enjoyment?
<span class="reftext">26</span>To the man who is pleasing in His sight, He gives wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner He assigns the task of gathering and accumulating that which he will hand over to one who pleases God. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Some Hebrew manuscripts, LXX, Syriac; most Hebrew manuscripts <i class="calibre6">apart from me</i> or <i class="calibre6">more than I</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
