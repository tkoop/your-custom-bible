<font><font face="Tahoma, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt"><b>Ecclesiastes
2</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Futility of Pleasure</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I said to myself, “Come now, I will test
you with pleasure; enjoy what is good!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But it proved to be futile. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I said of laughter, “It is folly,” and
of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I sought to cheer my body with wine and to
embrace folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom—until I could
see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few
days of their lives. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I expanded my pursuits. I built houses and
planted vineyards for myself. I made gardens and parks for myself,
where I planted all kinds of fruit trees. I built reservoirs to water
my groves of flourishing trees. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I acquired menservants and maidservants,
and servants were born in my house. I also owned more herds and
flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me, and I accumulated for
myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I
gathered to myself male and female singers, and the delights of the
sons of men—many concubines. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I became great and surpassed all in
Jerusalem who had preceded me; and my wisdom remained with me.
Anything my eyes desired, I did not deny myself. I refused my heart
no pleasure. For my heart took delight in all my work, and this was
the reward for all my labor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Yet when I considered all the works that
my hands had accomplished and what I had toiled to achieve, I found
everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind; there was nothing to
be gained under the sun. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I turned to consider wisdom and
madness and folly; for what more can the king’s successor do than
what has already been accomplished? And I saw that wisdom exceeds
folly, just as light exceeds darkness: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The wise man has eyes in his head, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">but the fool walks in darkness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Yet I also came to realize that one fate
overcomes them both. So I said to myself, “The fate of the fool
will also befall me. What then have I gained by being wise?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And I said to myself that this too is
futile. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For there is no lasting remembrance of the
wise, just as with the fool, seeing that both will be forgotten in
the days to come. Alas, the wise man will die just like the fool! So
I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was
grievous to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I hated all for which I had toiled under
the sun, because I must leave it to the man who comes after me. And
who knows whether that man will be wise or foolish? Yet he will take
over all the labor at which I have worked skillfully under the sun.
This too is futile. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So my heart began to despair over all the
labor that I had done under the sun. When there is a man who has
labored with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and he must give his
portion to a man who has not worked for it, this too is futile and a
great evil. For what does a man get for all the toil and striving
with which he labors under the sun? Indeed, all his days are filled
with grief, and his task is sorrowful; even at night, his mind does
not rest. This too is futile. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nothing is better for a man than to eat
and drink and enjoy his work. I have also seen that this is from the
hand of God. For apart from Him, who can eat and who can find
enjoyment? To the man who is pleasing in His sight, He gives wisdom
and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner He assigns the task of
gathering and accumulating that which he will hand over to one who
pleases God. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind. </font>
