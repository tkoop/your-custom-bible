</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>Listen, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, </p><p class="indent"> for the LORD has spoken: </p><p class="indent1stline"> “I have raised children and brought them up, </p><p class="indent"> but they have rebelled against Me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>The ox knows its owner, </p><p class="indent"> and the donkey its master’s manger, </p><p class="indent1"> but Israel does not know; </p><p class="indent"> My people do not understand.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Alas, O sinful nation, </p><p class="indent"> a people laden with iniquity, </p><p class="indent1"> a brood of evildoers, </p><p class="indent"> children of depravity! </p><p class="indent1"> They have forsaken the LORD; </p><p class="indent"> they have despised the Holy One of Israel </p><p class="indent"> and turned their backs on Him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Why do you want more beatings? </p><p class="indent"> Why do you keep rebelling? </p><p class="indent1"> Your head has a massive wound, </p><p class="indent"> and your whole heart is afflicted.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>From the sole of your foot to the top of your head, </p><p class="indent"> there is no soundness—</p><p class="indent1"> only wounds and welts and festering sores </p><p class="indent"> neither cleansed nor bandaged nor soothed with oil.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>Your land is desolate; </p><p class="indent"> your cities are burned with fire. </p><p class="indent1"> Foreigners devour your fields before you—</p><p class="indent"> a desolation demolished by strangers.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And the Daughter of Zion is abandoned </p><p class="indent"> like a shelter in a vineyard, </p><p class="indent1"> like a shack in a cucumber field, </p><p class="indent"> like a city besieged.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Unless the LORD of Hosts </p><p class="indent"> had left us a few survivors,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> we would have become like Sodom, </p><p class="indent"> we would have resembled Gomorrah.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Meaningless Offerings</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Hear the word of the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> you rulers of Sodom; </p><p class="indent1"> listen to the instruction of our God, </p><p class="indent"> you people of Gomorrah!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>“What good to Me is your multitude of sacrifices?” </p><p class="indent"> says the LORD. </p><p class="indent1">“I am full from the burnt offerings of rams </p><p class="indent"> and the fat of well-fed cattle; </p><p class="indent1"> I take no delight in the blood of bulls </p><p class="indent"> and lambs and goats.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>When you come to appear before Me, </p><p class="indent"> who has required this of you—</p><p class="indent"> this trampling of My courts?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Bring your worthless offerings no more; </p><p class="indent"> your incense is detestable to Me—</p><p class="indent"> your New Moons, Sabbaths, and convocations. </p><p class="indent1"> I cannot endure iniquity </p><p class="indent"> in a solemn assembly.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I hate your New Moons </p><p class="indent"> and your appointed feasts. </p><p class="indent1"> They have become a burden to Me; </p><p class="indent"> I am weary of bearing them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>When you spread out your hands in prayer, </p><p class="indent"> I will hide My eyes from you; </p><p class="indent1"> even though you multiply your prayers, </p><p class="indent"> I will not listen. </p><p class="indent"> Your hands are covered with blood.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>Wash and cleanse yourselves. </p><p class="indent"> Remove your evil deeds from My sight. </p><p class="indent"> Stop doing evil!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Learn to do right; </p><p class="indent"> seek justice and correct the oppressor.<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> Defend the fatherless </p><p class="indent">and plead the case of the widow.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>“Come now, let us reason together,” </p><p class="indent"> says the LORD. </p><p class="indent1">“Though your sins are like scarlet, </p><p class="indent"> they will be as white as snow; </p><p class="indent1"> though they are as red as crimson, </p><p class="indent"> they will become like wool.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>If you are willing and obedient, </p><p class="indent"> you will eat the best of the land.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>But if you resist and rebel, </p><p class="indent"> you will be devoured by the sword.” </p><p class="selah"> For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
</p><p class="hdg">The Corruption of Zion</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>See how the faithful city has become a harlot! </p><p class="indent"> She once was full of justice; </p><p class="indent1"> righteousness resided within her, </p><p class="indent"> but now only murderers!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Your silver has become dross; </p><p class="indent"> your fine wine is diluted with water.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Your rulers are rebels, </p><p class="indent"> friends of thieves. </p><p class="indent1"> They all love bribes </p><p class="indent"> and chasing after rewards. </p><p class="indent1"> They do not defend the fatherless, </p><p class="indent"> and the plea of the widow never comes before them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts, </p><p class="indent"> the Mighty One of Israel, declares: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Ah, I will be relieved of My foes </p><p class="indent"> and avenge Myself on My enemies.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>I will turn My hand against you; </p><p class="indent"> I will thoroughly purge your dross; </p><p class="indent"> I will remove all your impurities.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>I will restore your judges as at first, </p><p class="indent"> and your counselors as at the beginning. </p><p class="indent1"> After that you will be called the City of Righteousness, </p><p class="indent"> the Faithful City.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>Zion will be redeemed with justice, </p><p class="indent"> her repentant ones with righteousness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>But rebels and sinners will together be shattered, </p><p class="indent"> and those who forsake the LORD will perish.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Surely you will be ashamed of the sacred oaks </p><p class="indent"> in which you have delighted; </p><p class="indent1"> you will be embarrassed by the gardens </p><p class="indent"> that you have chosen.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">30</span>For you will become like an oak whose leaves are withered, </p><p class="indent"> like a garden without water.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>The strong man will become tinder </p><p class="indent"> and his work will be a spark; </p><p class="indent1"> both will burn together, </p><p class="indent"> with no one to quench the flames.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">had left us descendants</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Cited in Romans 9:29<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">and encourage the oppressed</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div>
