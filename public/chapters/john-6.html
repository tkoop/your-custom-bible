<span class="reftext">2</span>A large crowd followed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> because they saw the signs <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was performing on the sick.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples.

<span class="reftext">6</span>But <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was asking this to test him, for <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> knew what <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was about to do.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii<span class="fn">a</span>  would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece.”

</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">10</span>“Have the people sit down,”</span> Jesus said. Now there was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, about five thousand of them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And when everyone was full, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples, <span>“Gather the pieces that are left over, so that nothing will be wasted.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed,<span class="fn">b</span>  they began to say, “Truly this is the <span class='cap'>Prophet</span><span class='nocap'>prophet</span><span class='bsb'>Prophet</span> who is to come into the world.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and make <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span><span class='bsb'>Himself</span>.

<span class="reftext">21</span>Then they were willing to take <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> into the boat, and at once the boat reached the shore where they were heading.

<span class="reftext">23</span>However, some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
<span class="reftext">24</span>So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span class="reftext">25</span>When they found <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> on the other side of the sea, they asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, “Rabbi, when did <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> get here?”
