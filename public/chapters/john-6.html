<span class="reftext">2</span>A large crowd followed Him because they saw the signs He was performing on the sick.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with His disciples.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near.
<span class="reftext">5</span>When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward Him, He said to Philip, <span>“Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?”</span>
<span class="reftext">6</span>But He was asking this to test him, for He knew what He was about to do.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii<span class="fn">a</span>  would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,
<span class="reftext">9</span>“Here is a boy with five barley loaves and two small fish. But what difference will these make among so many?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">10</span>“Have the people sit down,”</span> Jesus said. Now there was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, about five thousand of them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And when everyone was full, He said to His disciples, <span>“Gather the pieces that are left over, so that nothing will be wasted.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed,<span class="fn">b</span>  they began to say, “Truly this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and make Him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by Himself.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Walks on Water<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 14:22–33; Mark 6:45–52)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,
<span class="reftext">17</span>got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was already dark, and Jesus had not yet gone out to them.
<span class="reftext">18</span>A strong wind was blowing, and the sea grew agitated.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>When they had rowed about three or four miles,<span class="fn">c</span>  they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the sea—and they were terrified.
<span class="reftext">20</span>But Jesus spoke up: <span>“It is I; do not be afraid.”</span>
<span class="reftext">21</span>Then they were willing to take Him into the boat, and at once the boat reached the shore where they were heading.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus the Bread of Life</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with His disciples, but they had gone away alone.
<span class="reftext">23</span>However, some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
<span class="reftext">24</span>So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for Him.
<span class="reftext">25</span>When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, it is not because you saw these signs that you are looking for Me, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on Him God the Father has placed His seal of approval.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then they inquired, “What must we do to perform the works of God?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Jesus replied, <span>“The work of God is this: to believe in the One He has sent.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>So they asked Him, “What sign then will You perform, so that we may see it and believe You? What will You do?
<span class="reftext">31</span>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’<span class="fn">d</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.
<span class="reftext">33</span>For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>“Sir,” they said, “give us this bread at all times.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Jesus answered, <span>“I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and whoever believes in Me will never thirst.
<span class="reftext">36</span>But as I stated, you have seen Me and still you do not believe.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">37</span>Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never drive away.
<span class="reftext">38</span>For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but to do the will of Him who sent Me.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">39</span>And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that I shall lose none of those He has given Me, but raise them up at the last day.
<span class="reftext">40</span>For it is My Father’s will that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>At this, the Jews began to grumble about Jesus because He had said, <span>“I am the bread that came down from heaven.”</span>
<span class="reftext">42</span>They were asking, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then can He say, <span>‘I have come down from heaven?’</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">43</span>“Stop grumbling among yourselves,”</span> Jesus replied.
<span><span class="reftext">44</span>“No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.
<span class="reftext">45</span>It is written in the Prophets: ‘And they will all be taught by God.’<span class="fn">e</span>  Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from Him comes to Me—
<span class="reftext">46</span>not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God; only He has seen the Father.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">47</span>Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes has eternal life.
<span class="reftext">48</span>I am the bread of life.
<span class="reftext">49</span>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.
<span class="reftext">50</span>This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.
<span class="reftext">51</span>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And this bread, which I will give for the life of the world, is My flesh.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">52</span>At this, the Jews began to argue among themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">53</span>So Jesus said to them, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, you have no life in you.
<span class="reftext">54</span>Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
<span class="reftext">55</span>For My flesh is real food, and My blood is real drink.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">56</span>Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him.
<span class="reftext">57</span>Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on Me will live because of Me.
<span class="reftext">58</span>This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your fathers, who ate the manna and died, the one who eats this bread will live forever.”
</p><p class="hdg">Many Disciples Turn Back<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 8:18–22; Luke 9:57–62; Luke 14:25–33)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">59</span>Jesus said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
<span class="reftext">60</span>On hearing it, many of His disciples said, “This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">61</span>Aware that His disciples were grumbling about this teaching, Jesus asked them, <span>“Does this offend you?
<span class="reftext">62</span>Then what will happen if you see the Son of Man ascend to where He was before?</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">63</span>The Spirit gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.
<span class="reftext">64</span>However, there are some of you who do not believe.”</span> (For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray Him.)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">65</span>Then Jesus said, <span>“This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless the Father has granted it to him.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">66</span>From that time on many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him.
</p><p class="hdg">Peter’s Confession of Faith<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 16:13–20; Mark 8:27–30; Luke 9:18–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">67</span>So Jesus asked the Twelve, <span>“Do you want to leave too?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">68</span>Simon Peter replied, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.
<span class="reftext">69</span>We believe and know that You are the Holy One of God.<span class="fn">f</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">70</span>Jesus answered them, <span>“Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!”</span>
<span class="reftext">71</span>He was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For although Judas was one of the Twelve, he was later to betray Jesus.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> A denarius was customarily a day’s wage for a <span class='spell ca'>labourer</span><span class='spell gb'>labourer</span><span class='spell us'>laborer</span>; see Matthew 20:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> SBL, NA, NE, and WH <i class="calibre6">He had performed</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">about twenty-five or thirty stadia</i>; that is, approximately 2.87 to 3.45 miles (4.62 to 5.55 kilometers)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Psalm 78:24; see also Exodus 16:4.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">45</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Isaiah 54:13<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">69</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">You are the Christ, the Son of the living God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
