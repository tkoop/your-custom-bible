<font face="Tahoma, serif">After this, Jesus crossed to the other
side of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias). A large
crowd followed Him because they saw the signs He was performing on
the sick. Then Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with His
disciples. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was
near. When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward Him,
He said to Philip, <font color="#a80000">“Where can we buy bread
for these people to eat?”</font> But He was asking this to test
him, for He knew what He was about to do. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii
would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon
Peter’s brother, said to Him, “Here is a boy with five barley
loaves and two small fish. But what difference will these make among
so many?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Have the people
sit down,”</font> Jesus said. Now there was plenty of grass in that
place, so the men sat down, about five thousand of them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish,
gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they
wanted. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when everyone was full, He said to His
disciples, <font color="#a80000">“Gather the pieces that are left
over, so that nothing will be wasted.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they collected them and filled twelve
baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those
who had eaten. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the people saw the sign that Jesus
had performed, they began to say, “Truly this is the Prophet who is
to come into the world.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus, realizing that they were about
to come and make Him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by
Himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When evening came, His disciples went down
to the sea, got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum.
It was already dark, and Jesus had not yet gone out to them. A strong
wind was blowing, and the sea grew agitated. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When they had rowed about three or four
miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the sea—and
they were terrified. But Jesus spoke up: <font color="#a80000">“It
is I; do not be afraid.”</font> Then they were willing to take Him
into the boat, and at once the boat reached the shore where they were
heading. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The next day, the crowd that had remained
on the other side of the sea realized that only one boat had been
there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with His disciples, but they
had gone away alone. However, some boats from Tiberias landed near
the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had
given thanks. So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His
disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum
to look for Him. When they found Him on the other side of the sea,
they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Truly,
truly, I tell you, it is not because you saw these signs that you are
looking for Me, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. Do
not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal
life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on Him God the Father
has placed His seal of approval.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they inquired, “What must we do to
perform the works of God?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“The
work of God is this: to believe in the One He has sent.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they asked Him, “What sign then will
You perform, so that we may see it and believe You? What will You do?
Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written: ‘He
gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Truly,
truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from
heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.
For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life
to the world.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Sir,” they said, “give us this
bread at all times.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“I
am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and
whoever believes in Me will never thirst. But as I stated, you have
seen Me and still you do not believe.</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Everyone the Father

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At this, the Jews began to grumble about
Jesus because He had said, <font color="#a80000">“I am the bread
that came down from heaven.”</font> They were asking, “Is this
not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How
then can He say, <font color="#a80000">‘I have come down from
heaven?’</font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Stop grumbling
among yourselves,”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“No
one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I
will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the Prophets:
‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard the
Father and learned from Him comes to Me— not that anyone has seen
the Father except the One who is from God; only He has seen the
Father.</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Truly, truly, I tell
you, he who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your
fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. This is the
bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and
not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone
eats of this bread, he will live forever. And this bread, which I
will give for the life of the world, is My flesh.” </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At this, the Jews began to argue among
themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Truly,

the Son of Man, you have no life in you. Whoever eats My flesh and

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus said this while teaching in the

them did not believe and who would betray Him.) </font>
