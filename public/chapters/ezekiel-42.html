<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the man led me out northward into the
outer court, and he brought me to the group of chambers opposite the
temple courtyard and the outer wall on the north side. The building
with the door facing north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits
wide. Gallery faced gallery in three levels opposite the twenty
cubits that belonged to the inner court and opposite the pavement
that belonged to the outer court. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In front of the chambers was an inner
walkway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long. Their doors were
on the north. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the upper chambers were smaller
because the galleries took more space from the chambers on the lower
and middle floors of the building. For they were arranged in three
stories, and unlike the courts, they had no pillars. So the upper
chambers were set back further than the lower and middle floors. An
outer wall in front of the chambers was fifty cubits long and ran
parallel to the chambers and the outer court. For the chambers on the
outer court were fifty cubits long, while those facing the temple
were a hundred cubits long. And below these chambers was the entrance
on the east side as one enters them from the outer court. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the south side along the length of the
wall of the outer court were chambers adjoining the courtyard and
opposite the building, with a passageway in front of them, just like
the chambers that were on the north. They had the same length and
width, with similar exits and dimensions. And corresponding to the
doors of the chambers that were facing south, there was a door in
front of the walkway that was parallel to the wall extending
eastward. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the man said to me, “The north and
south chambers facing the temple courtyard are the holy chambers
where the priests who approach the LORD will eat the most holy
offerings. There they will place the most holy offerings—the grain
offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings—for the place
is holy. Once the priests have entered the holy area, they must not
go out into the outer court until they have left behind the garments
in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other
clothes before they approach the places that are for the people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when the man had finished measuring
the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate that faced
east, and he measured the area all around: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.4cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">With a measuring rod he measured the east
side to be five hundred cubits long. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He measured the north side to be five
hundred cubits long. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He measured the south side to be five
hundred cubits long. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And he came around and measured the west
side to be five hundred cubits long. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So he measured the area on all four sides.
It had a wall all around, five hundred cubits long and five hundred
cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common. </font>
