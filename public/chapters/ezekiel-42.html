<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Chambers for the Priests</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the man led me out northward into the outer court, and he brought me to the group of chambers opposite the temple courtyard and the outer wall on the north side.
<span class="reftext">2</span>The building with the door facing north was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Gallery faced gallery in three levels opposite the twenty cubits<span class="fn">b</span>  that belonged to the inner court and opposite the <span class='spell ca'>pavement</span><span class='spell gb'>roadway</span><span class='spell us'>pavement</span> that belonged to the outer court.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>In front of the chambers was an inner walkway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long.<span class="fn">c</span>  Their doors were on the north.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now the upper chambers were smaller because the galleries took more space from the chambers on the lower and middle floors of the building.
<span class="reftext">6</span>For they were arranged in three stories, and unlike the courts, they had no pillars. So the upper chambers were set back further than the lower and middle floors.
<span class="reftext">7</span>An outer wall in front of the chambers was fifty cubits long and ran parallel to the chambers and the outer court.
<span class="reftext">8</span>For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those facing the temple were a hundred cubits long.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And below these chambers was the entrance on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>On the south side<span class="fn">d</span>  along the length of the wall of the outer court were chambers adjoining the courtyard and opposite the building,
<span class="reftext">11</span>with a passageway in front of them, just like the chambers that were on the north. They had the same length and width, with similar exits and dimensions.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And corresponding to the doors of the chambers that were facing south, there was a door in front of the walkway that was parallel to the wall extending eastward.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then the man said to me, “The north and south chambers facing the temple courtyard are the holy chambers where the priests who approach <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will eat the most holy offerings. There they will place the most holy offerings—the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings—for the place is holy.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Once the priests have entered the holy area, they must not go out into the outer court until they have left behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They are to put on other clothes before they approach the places that are for the people.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Outer Measurements</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now when the man had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate that faced east, and he measured the area all around:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>With a measuring rod he measured the east side to be five hundred cubits long.<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>He measured the north side to be five hundred cubits long.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>He measured the south side to be five hundred cubits long.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>And he came around and measured the west side to be five hundred cubits long.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall all around, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> The building was approximately 175 feet long and 87.5 feet wide (53.3 meters long and 26.7 meters wide).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">20 (long) cubits</i> is approximately 35 feet or 10.7 meters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> LXX.
