<font >It is actually reported that there is
sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is intolerable even
among pagans: A man has his father’s wife. And you are proud!
Shouldn’t you rather have been stricken with grief and have removed
from your fellowship the man who did this? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Although I am absent from you in body, I
am present with you in spirit, and I have already pronounced judgment
on the one who did this, just as if I were present. When you are
assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit,
along with the power of the Lord Jesus, hand this man over to Satan
for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on
the Day of the Lord. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Your boasting is not good. Do you not know
that a little leaven works through the whole batch of dough? Get rid
of the old leaven, that you may be a new unleavened batch, as you
really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
Therefore let us keep the feast, not with the old bread, leavened
with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of
sincerity and of truth. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I wrote you in my letter not to associate
with sexually immoral people. I was not including the sexually
immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In
that case you would have to leave this world. But now I am writing
you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother but is
sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a verbal abuser, a
drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >What business of mine is it to judge those
outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge
those outside. “Expel the wicked man from among you.” </font>
