<span class="reftext">2</span>And <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have been stricken with grief and have removed from <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fellowship the man who did this?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Although I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit, and I have already pronounced <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> on the one who did this, just as if I were present.
<span class="reftext">4</span>When <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus<span class="fn">a</span>  and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of the Lord Jesus,
<span class="reftext">5</span>hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the <span class='cap'>Day</span><span class='nocap'>day</span><span class='bsb'>Day</span> of the Lord.<span class="fn">b</span>

<span class="reftext">7</span>Get rid of the old leaven, that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may be a new unleavened batch, as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with the old bread, leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth.

<span class="reftext">10</span>I was not including the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> would have to leave this world.
<span class="reftext">11</span>But now I am writing <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a verbal abuser, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.
