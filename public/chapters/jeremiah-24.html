<font >After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had
carried away Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, as well as the
officials of Judah and the craftsmen and metalsmiths from Jerusalem,
and had brought them to Babylon, the LORD showed me two baskets of
figs placed in front of the temple of the LORD. One basket had very
good figs, like those that ripen early, but the other basket
contained very poor figs, so bad they could not be eaten. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Jeremiah,” the LORD asked, “what do
you see?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Figs!” I replied. “The good figs
are very good, but the bad figs are very bad, so bad they cannot be
eaten.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Like
these good figs, so I regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I
have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans. I will
keep My eyes on them for good and will return them to this land. I
will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not
uproot them. I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the LORD.
They will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return
to Me with all their heart. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But like the bad figs, so bad they cannot
be eaten,’ says the LORD, ‘so will I deal with Zedekiah king of
Judah, his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem—those remaining
in this land and those living in the land of Egypt. I will make them
a horror and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth, a disgrace
and an object of scorn, ridicule, and cursing wherever I have
banished them. And I will send against them sword and famine and
plague, until they have perished from the land that I gave to them
and their fathers.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
