</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>I will open my mouth in parables; </p><p class="indent"> I will utter things hidden from the beginning,<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>that we have heard and known </p><p class="indent"> and our fathers have relayed to us.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>We will not hide them from their children, </p><p class="indent"> but will declare to the next generation </p><p class="indent1"> the praises of the LORD and His might, </p><p class="indent"> and the wonders He has performed.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>For He established a testimony in Jacob </p><p class="indent"> and appointed a law in Israel, </p><p class="indent1"> which He commanded our fathers </p><p class="indent"> to teach to their children,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>that the coming generation would know them—</p><p class="indent"> even children yet to be born—</p><p class="indent"> to arise and tell their own children
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>that they should put their confidence in God, </p><p class="indent"> not forgetting His works, </p><p class="indent"> but keeping His commandments.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then they will not be like their fathers, </p><p class="indent"> a stubborn and rebellious generation, </p><p class="indent1"> whose heart was not loyal, </p><p class="indent"> whose spirit was not faithful to God.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>The archers of Ephraim </p><p class="indent"> turned back on the day of battle.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>They failed to keep God’s covenant </p><p class="indent"> and refused to live by His law.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>They forgot what He had done, </p><p class="indent"> the wonders He had shown them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>He worked wonders before their fathers </p><p class="indent"> in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>He split the sea and brought them through; </p><p class="indent"> He set the waters upright like a wall.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>He led them with a cloud by day </p><p class="indent"> and with a light of fire all night.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>He split the rocks in the wilderness </p><p class="indent"> and gave them drink as abundant as the seas.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>He brought streams from the stone </p><p class="indent"> and made water flow down like rivers.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>But they continued to sin against Him, </p><p class="indent"> rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>They wilfully tested God </p><p class="indent"> by demanding the food they craved.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>They spoke against God, saying, </p><p class="indent">“Can God really prepare a table in the wilderness?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>When He struck the rock, water gushed out </p><p class="indent"> and torrents raged. </p><p class="indent1"> But can He also give bread </p><p class="indent"> or supply His people with meat?”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>Therefore the LORD heard </p><p class="indent"> and was filled with wrath; </p><p class="indent1"> so a fire was kindled against Jacob, </p><p class="indent"> and His anger flared against Israel,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>because they did not believe God </p><p class="indent"> or rely on His salvation.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>Yet He commanded the clouds above </p><p class="indent"> and opened the doors of the heavens.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>He rained down manna for them to eat; </p><p class="indent"> He gave them grain from heaven.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Man ate the bread of angels; </p><p class="indent"> He sent them food in abundance.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>He stirred the east wind from the heavens </p><p class="indent"> and drove the south wind by His might.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>He rained meat on them like dust, </p><p class="indent"> and winged birds like the sand of the sea.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>He felled them in the midst of their camp, </p><p class="indent"> all around their dwellings.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>So they ate and were well filled, </p><p class="indent"> for He gave them what they craved.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">30</span>Yet before they had filled their desire, </p><p class="indent"> with the food still in their mouths,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>God’s anger flared against them, </p><p class="indent"> and He put to death their strongest </p><p class="indent"> and subdued the young men of Israel.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">32</span>In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; </p><p class="indent"> despite His wonderful works, they did not believe.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>So He ended their days in futility,<span class="fn">d</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and their years in sudden terror.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">34</span>When He slew them, they would seek Him; </p><p class="indent"> they repented and searched for God.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>And they remembered that God was their Rock, </p><p class="indent"> that God Most High<span class="fn">e</span>  was their Redeemer.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">36</span>But they deceived Him with their mouths, </p><p class="indent"> and lied to Him with their tongues.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">37</span>Their hearts were disloyal to Him, </p><p class="indent"> and they were unfaithful to His covenant.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">38</span>And yet He was compassionate; </p><p class="indent"> He forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them. </p><p class="indent1"> He often restrained His anger </p><p class="indent"> and did not unleash His full wrath.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">39</span>He remembered that they were but flesh, </p><p class="indent"> a passing breeze that does not return.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">40</span>How often they disobeyed Him in the wilderness </p><p class="indent"> and grieved Him in the desert!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">41</span>Again and again they tested God </p><p class="indent"> and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">42</span>They did not remember His power<span class="fn">f</span> —</p><p class="indent"> the day He redeemed them from the adversary,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">43</span>when He performed His signs in Egypt </p><p class="indent"> and His wonders in the fields of Zoan.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">44</span>He turned their rivers to blood, </p><p class="indent"> and from their streams they could not drink.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">45</span>He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, </p><p class="indent"> and frogs that devastated them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">46</span>He gave their crops to the grasshopper, </p><p class="indent"> the fruit of their labour to the locust.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">47</span>He killed their vines with hailstones </p><p class="indent"> and their sycamore-figs with sleet.<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">48</span>He abandoned their cattle to the hail </p><p class="indent"> and their livestock to bolts of lightning.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">49</span>He unleashed His fury against them, </p><p class="indent"> wrath, indignation, and calamity—</p><p class="indent"> a band of destroying angels.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">50</span>He cleared a path for His anger; </p><p class="indent"> He did not spare them from death </p><p class="indent"> but delivered their lives to the plague.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">51</span>He struck all the firstborn of Egypt, </p><p class="indent"> the virility in the tents of Ham.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">52</span>He led out His people like sheep </p><p class="indent"> and guided them like a flock in the wilderness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">53</span>He led them safely, so they did not fear, </p><p class="indent"> but the sea engulfed their enemies.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">54</span>He brought them to His holy land, </p><p class="indent"> to the mountain His right hand had acquired.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">55</span>He drove out nations before them </p><p class="indent"> and apportioned their inheritance; </p><p class="indent"> He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">56</span>But they tested and disobeyed God Most High, </p><p class="indent"> for they did not keep His decrees.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">57</span>They turned back and were faithless like their fathers, </p><p class="indent"> twisted like a faulty bow.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">58</span>They enraged Him with their high places </p><p class="indent"> and provoked His jealousy with their idols.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">59</span>On hearing it, God was furious </p><p class="indent"> and rejected Israel completely.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">60</span>He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, </p><p class="indent"> the tent He had pitched among men.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">61</span>He delivered His strength to captivity, </p><p class="indent"> and His splendour to the hand of the adversary.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">62</span>He surrendered His people to the sword </p><p class="indent"> because He was enraged by His heritage.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">63</span>Fire consumed His young men, </p><p class="indent"> and their maidens were left without wedding songs.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">64</span>His priests fell by the sword, </p><p class="indent"> but their widows could not lament.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">65</span>Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, </p><p class="indent"> like a mighty warrior overcome by wine.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">66</span>He beat back His foes; </p><p class="indent"> He put them to everlasting shame.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">67</span>He rejected the tent of Joseph </p><p class="indent"> and refused the tribe of Ephraim.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">68</span>But He chose the tribe of Judah, </p><p class="indent"> Mount Zion, which He loved.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">69</span>He built His sanctuary like the heights, </p><p class="indent"> like the earth He has established forever.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">70</span>He chose David His servant </p><p class="indent"> and took him from the sheepfolds;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">71</span>from tending the ewes He brought him </p><p class="indent"> to be shepherd of His people Jacob, </p><p class="indent"> of Israel His inheritance.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">72</span>So David shepherded them with integrity of heart </p><p class="indent"> and guided them with skilful hands.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Maskil</i> is probably a musical or liturgical term; used for Psalms 32, 42, 44–45, 52–55, 74, 78, 88–89, and 142.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">from ancient times</i>; see also LXX; cited in Matthew 13:35<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Cited in John 6:31<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in vapour</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">El-Elyon</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">42</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">His hand</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">47</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">frost</i> or <i class="calibre6">driving rain</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
