<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Paul before the Sanhedrin</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul looked directly at the Sanhedrin<span class="fn">a</span>  and said, “Brothers, I have conducted myself before God in all good conscience to this day.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>At this, the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit here to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But those standing nearby said, “How dare you insult the high priest of God!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>“Brothers,” Paul replied, “I was not aware that he was the high priest, for it is written: ‘Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.’<span class="fn">b</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. It is because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>As soon as he had said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
<span class="reftext">8</span>For the Sadducees say that there is neither a resurrection, nor angels, nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>A great <span class='spell ca'>clamour</span><span class='spell gb'>clamour</span><span class='spell us'>clamor</span> arose, and some scribes from the party of the Pharisees got up and contended sharply, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”
<span class="reftext">10</span>The dispute grew so violent that the commander was afraid they would tear Paul to pieces. He ordered the soldiers to go down and remove him by force and bring him into the barracks.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, <span>“Take courage! As you have testified about <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> in Jerusalem, so also you must testify in Rome.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Plot to Kill Paul<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(John 16:1–4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>When daylight came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
<span class="reftext">13</span>More than forty of them were involved in this plot.
<span class="reftext">14</span>They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have bound ourselves with a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Now then, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him down to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> on the pretext of examining his case more carefully. We are ready to kill him on the way.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But when the son of Paul’s sister heard about the plot,<span class="fn">c</span>  he went into the barracks and told Paul.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>So the centurion took him to the commander and said, “Paul the prisoner sent and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside, and asked, “What do you need to tell me?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>He answered, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul to the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of acquiring more information about him.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Do not let them persuade you, because more than forty men are waiting to ambush him. They have bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him; they are ready now, awaiting your consent.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So the commander dismissed the young man and instructed him, “Do not tell anyone that you have reported this to me.”
</p><p class="hdg">Paul Sent to Felix</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then he called two of his centurions and said, “Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea in the third hour of the night.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Provide mounts for Paul to take him safely to Governor Felix.”
<span class="reftext">25</span>And he wrote the following letter:
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>Claudius Lysias, </p><p class="tab1stline"> To <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> <span class='cap'>Excellency</span><span class='nocap'>excellency</span>, Governor Felix: </p><p class="tab1stline"> Greetings.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>This man was seized by the Jews, and they were about to kill him when I came with my troops to rescue him. For I had learned that he is a Roman citizen,
<span class="reftext">28</span>and since I wanted to understand their charges against him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin.
<span class="reftext">29</span>I found that the accusation involved questions about their own law, but there was no charge worthy of death or imprisonment.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">30</span>When I was informed that there was a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also instructed his accusers to present their case against him before you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>So the soldiers followed their orders and brought Paul by night to Antipatris.
<span class="reftext">32</span>The next day they returned to the barracks and let the horsemen go on with him.
<span class="reftext">33</span>When the horsemen arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and presented Paul to him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>The governor read the letter and asked what province Paul was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia,
<span class="reftext">35</span>he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers arrive.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s Praetorium.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Council</i>; also in verses 6, 15, 20, and 28<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Exodus 22:28 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the ambush</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> That is, at nine tonight<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
