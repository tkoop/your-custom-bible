<font ><b>Paul before the Sanhedrin</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Paul looked directly at the Sanhedrin and
said, “Brothers, I have conducted myself before God in all good
conscience to this day.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, the high priest Ananias ordered
those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Paul said to him, “God will strike
you, you whitewashed wall! You sit here to judge me according to the
law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be
struck.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But those standing nearby said, “How
dare you insult the high priest of God!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Brothers,” Paul replied, “I was not
aware that he was the high priest, for it is written: ‘Do not speak
evil about the ruler of your people.’” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Paul, knowing that some of them were
Sadducees and others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin,
“Brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. It is because of
my hope in the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As soon as he had said this, a dispute
broke out between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was
divided. For the Sadducees say that there is neither a resurrection,
nor angels, nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A great clamor arose, and some scribes
from the party of the Pharisees got up and contended sharply, “We
find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has
spoken to him?” The dispute grew so violent that the commander was
afraid they would tear Paul to pieces. He ordered the soldiers to go
down and remove him by force and bring him into the barracks. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The following night the Lord stood near
Paul and said, <font color="#a80000">“Take courage! As you have
testified about Me in Jerusalem, so also you must testify in Rome.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When daylight came, the Jews formed a
conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink
until they had killed Paul. More than forty of them were involved in
this plot. They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We
have bound ourselves with a solemn oath not to eat anything until we
have killed Paul. Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the
commander to bring him down to you on the pretext of examining his
case more carefully. We are ready to kill him on the way.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when the son of Paul’s sister heard
about the plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul. Then Paul
called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the
commander; he has something to tell him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the centurion took him to the commander
and said, “Paul the prisoner sent and asked me to bring this young
man to you. He has something to tell you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The commander took the young man by the
hand, drew him aside, and asked, “What do you need to tell me?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He answered, “The Jews have agreed to
ask you to bring Paul to the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of
acquiring more information about him. Do not let them persuade you,
because more than forty men are waiting to ambush him. They have
bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they have
killed him; they are ready now, awaiting your consent.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the commander dismissed the young man
and instructed him, “Do not tell anyone that you have reported this
to me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he called two of his centurions and
said, “Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two
hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea in the third hour of the night.
Provide mounts for Paul to take him safely to Governor Felix.” And
he wrote the following letter: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Claudius Lysias, </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >To His Excellency, Governor Felix: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Greetings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This man was seized by the Jews, and they
were about to kill him when I came with my troops to rescue him. For
I had learned that he is a Roman citizen, and since I wanted to
understand their charges against him, I brought him down to their
Sanhedrin. I found that the accusation involved questions about their
own law, but there was no charge worthy of death or imprisonment. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When I was informed that there was a plot
against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also instructed his
accusers to present their case against him before you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the soldiers followed their orders and
brought Paul by night to Antipatris. The next day they returned to
the barracks and let the horsemen go on with him. When the horsemen
arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and
presented Paul to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The governor read the letter and asked
what province Paul was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia, he
said, “I will hear your case when your accusers arrive.” Then he
ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s Praetorium. </font>
