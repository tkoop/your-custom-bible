<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a><span class="reftext">3</span>For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">a</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now the wages of the worker are not credited as a gift, but as an obligation.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a><span class="reftext">5</span>However, to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a><span class="reftext">6</span>And David speaks likewise of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a></p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>“Blessed are they whose lawless acts are forgiven, </p><p class="indent"> whose sins are covered.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Is this blessing only on the circumcised, or also on the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a><span class="reftext">10</span>In what context was it credited? Was it after his circumcision, or before? It was not after, but before.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">c</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but are not circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a><span class="reftext">12</span>And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a><span class="reftext">14</span>For if those who live by the law are heirs, faith is useless and the promise is worthless,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a><span class="reftext">15</span>because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law, there is no transgression.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may rest on grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a><span class="reftext">17</span>As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.”<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">d</a></span>  He is our father in the presence of God, in whom he believed, the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not yet exist.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as he had been told, “So shall your offspring be.”<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">e</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a><span class="reftext">19</span>Without weakening in his faith, he acknowledged the decrepitness of his body (since he was about a hundred years old) and the lifelessness of Sarah’s womb.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a><span class="reftext">20</span>Yet he did not waver through disbelief in the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="21"></a><span class="reftext">21</span>being fully persuaded that God was able to do what He had promised.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a><span class="reftext">22</span>This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">f</a></span>
