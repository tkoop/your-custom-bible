<font ><b>The Birth of Jesus</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now in those days a decree went out from
Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole empire.
This was the first census to take place while Quirinius was governor
of Syria. And everyone went to his own town to register. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Joseph also went up from Nazareth in
Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, since he was
from the house and line of David. He went there to register with
Mary, who was pledged to him in marriage and was expecting a child. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >While they were there, the time came for
her Child to be born. And she gave birth to her firstborn, a Son. She
wrapped Him in swaddling cloths and laid Him in a manger, because
there was no room for them in the inn. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And there were shepherds residing in the
fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks by night. Just then an
angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone
around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, “Do
not be afraid! For behold, I bring you good news of great joy that
will be for all the people: Today in the city of David a Savior has
been born to you. He is Christ the Lord! And this will be a sign to
you: You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a
manger.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And suddenly there appeared with the angel
a great multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >Glory to God in the highest, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >and on earth peace to men </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >on whom His favor rests!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When the angels had left them and gone
into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go to
Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has
made known to us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So they hurried off and found Mary and
Joseph and the Baby, who was lying in the manger. After they had seen
the Child, they spread the message they had received about Him. And
all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But
Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The shepherds returned, glorifying and
praising God for all they had heard and seen, which was just as the
angel had told them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When the eight days until His circumcision
had passed, He was named Jesus, the name the angel had given Him
before He had been conceived. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And when the time of purification
according to the Law of Moses was complete, His parents brought Him
to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law
of the Lord: “Every firstborn male shall be consecrated to the
Lord”), and to offer the sacrifice specified in the Law of the
Lord: “A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now there was a man in Jerusalem named
Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the
consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. The Holy
Spirit had revealed to him that he would not see death before he had
seen the Lord’s Christ. Led by the Spirit, he went into the temple
courts. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for Him
what was customary under the Law, Simeon took Him in his arms and
blessed God, saying: </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The Child’s father and mother were
amazed at what was spoken about Him. Then Simeon blessed them and
said to His mother Mary: </font>

<font >There was also a prophetess named Anna,
the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, who was well along in
years. She had been married for seven years, and then was a widow to
the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, but worshiped
night and day, fasting and praying. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Coming forward at that moment, she gave
thanks to God and spoke about the Child to all who were waiting for

<font >When Jesus’ parents had done everything
required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their
own town of Nazareth. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And the Child grew and became strong. He
was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him. </font>

<font >Every year His parents went to Jerusalem
for the Feast of the Passover. And when He was twelve years old, they
went up according to the custom of the Feast. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When those days were over and they were
returning home, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, but His
parents were unaware He had stayed. Assuming He was in their company,
they traveled on for a day before they began to look for Him among
their relatives and friends. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When they could not find Him, they
returned to Jerusalem to search for Him. Finally, after three days
they found Him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers,
listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard Him
were astounded at His understanding and His answers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
