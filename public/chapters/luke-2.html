<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Birth of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 1:18–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole empire.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">2</span>This was the first census to take place while<span class="fn">b</span>  Quirinius was governor of Syria.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And everyone went to his own town to register.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So Joseph also went up from Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, since he was from the house and line of David.
<span class="reftext">5</span>He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to him in marriage and was expecting a child.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>While they were there, the time came for her Child to be born.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And she gave birth to her firstborn, a <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span>. She wrapped <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> in swaddling cloths and laid <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
</p><p class="hdg">The Shepherds and the Angels</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And there were shepherds residing in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks by night.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Just then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid! For behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people:
<span class="reftext">11</span>Today in the city of David a <span class='spell ca'>Saviour</span><span class='spell gb'>Saviour</span><span class='spell us'><span class='cap'>Savior</span><span class='nocap'>savior</span><span class='bsb'>Savior</span></span> has been born to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.

<span class="reftext">12</span>And this will be a sign to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>: <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And suddenly there appeared with the angel a great multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying:

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the <span class='cap'>Baby</span><span class='nocap'>baby</span><span class='bsb'>Baby</span>, who was lying in the manger.
<span class="reftext">17</span>After they had seen the Child, they spread the message they had received about <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, which was just as the angel had told them.
