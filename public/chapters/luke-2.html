<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Birth of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 1:18–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole empire.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">2</span>This was the first census to take place while<span class="fn">b</span>  Quirinius was governor of Syria.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And everyone went to his own town to register.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So Joseph also went up from Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, since he was from the house and line of David.
<span class="reftext">5</span>He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to him in marriage and was expecting a child.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>While they were there, the time came for her Child to be born.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And she gave birth to her firstborn, a Son. She wrapped Him in swaddling cloths and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
</p><p class="hdg">The Shepherds and the Angels</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And there were shepherds residing in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks by night.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Just then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid! For behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people:
<span class="reftext">11</span>Today in the city of David a Savior has been born to you. He is Christ the Lord!
<span class="reftext">12</span>And this will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And suddenly there appeared with the angel a great multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>“Glory to God in the highest, </p><p class="indent"> and on earth peace to men </p><p class="indent"> on whom His <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> rests!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the Baby, who was lying in the manger.
<span class="reftext">17</span>After they had seen the Child, they spread the message they had received about Him.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, which was just as the angel had told them.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Presented at the Temple</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>When the eight days until His circumcision had passed, He was named Jesus, the name the angel had given Him before He had been conceived.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And when the time of purification according to the Law of Moses was complete, His parents brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord
<span class="reftext">23</span>(as it is written in the Law of the Lord: “Every firstborn male shall be consecrated to the Lord”<span class="fn">c</span>),
<span class="reftext">24</span>and to offer the sacrifice specified in the Law of the Lord: “A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Prophecy of Simeon</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
<span class="reftext">26</span>The Holy Spirit had revealed to him that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Led by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts.<span class="fn">e</span>  And when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for Him what was customary under the Law,
<span class="reftext">28</span>Simeon took Him in his arms and blessed God, saying:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">29</span>“Sovereign Lord, as You have promised, </p><p class="indent"> You now dismiss Your servant in peace.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>For my eyes have seen Your salvation,
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">31</span>which You have prepared in the sight of all people,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>a light for revelation to the Gentiles, </p><p class="indent"> and for glory to Your people Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>The Child’s father and mother were amazed at what was spoken about Him.
<span class="reftext">34</span>Then Simeon blessed them and said to His mother Mary: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Behold, this Child is appointed to cause </p><p class="indent"> the rise and fall of many in Israel, </p><p class="indent"> and to be a sign that will be spoken against,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed—</p><p class="indent"> and a sword will pierce your soul as well.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Prophecy of Anna</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>There was also a prophetess named Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, who was well along in years. She had been married for seven years,
<span class="reftext">37</span>and then was a widow to the age of eighty-four.<span class="fn">f</span>  She never left the temple, but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>Coming forward at that moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the Child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.
</p><p class="hdg">The Return to Nazareth<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 2:19–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>When Jesus’ parents had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>And the Child grew and became strong.<span class="fn">g</span>  He was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him.
</p><p class="hdg">The Boy Jesus at the Temple</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>Every year His parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.
<span class="reftext">42</span>And when He was twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the Feast.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>When those days were over and they were returning home, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, but His parents were unaware He had stayed.
<span class="reftext">44</span>Assuming He was in their company, they <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> on for a day before they began to look for Him among their relatives and friends.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>When they could not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for Him.
<span class="reftext">46</span>Finally, after three days they found Him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
<span class="reftext">47</span>And all who heard Him were astounded at His understanding and His answers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>When His parents saw Him, they were astonished. “Child, why have You done this to us?” His mother asked. “Your father and I have been anxiously searching for You.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">49</span>“Why were you looking for Me?”</span> He asked. <span>“Did you not know that I had to be in My Father’s house<span class="fn">h</span>?”</span>
<span class="reftext">50</span>But they did not understand the statement He was making to them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">51</span>Then He went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But His mother treasured up all these things in her heart.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">52</span>And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> with God and man.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">of the whole land</i> or <i class="calibre6">of the whole world</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">This was the census before</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Exodus 13:2<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Leviticus 12:8<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i>; also in verse 46<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">37</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">was a widow for eighty-four years</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">40</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">became strong in spirit</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">49</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">I had to be about My Father’s business</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
