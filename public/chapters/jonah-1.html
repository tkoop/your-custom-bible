<font ><b>Jonah Flees from the LORD</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah son
of Amittai, saying, “Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh and
preach against it, because its wickedness has come up before Me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jonah, however, got up to flee to
Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD. He went down to Joppa
and found a ship bound for Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went
aboard to sail for Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD hurled a great wind upon the
sea, and such a violent storm arose that the ship was in danger of
breaking apart. The sailors were afraid, and each cried out to his
own god. And they threw the ship’s cargo into the sea to lighten
the load. But Jonah had gone down to the lowest part of the vessel,
where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The captain approached him and said, “How
can you sleep? Get up and call upon your God. Perhaps this God will
consider us, so that we may not perish.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Come!” said the sailors to one
another. “Let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this
calamity that is upon us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they cast lots, and the lot fell on
Jonah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Tell us now,” they demanded, “who
is to blame for this calamity that is upon us? What is your
occupation, and where have you come from? What is your country, and
who are your people?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I am a Hebrew,” replied Jonah. “I
worship the LORD, the God of the heavens, who made the sea and the
dry land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the men were even more afraid and
said to him, “What have you done?” The men knew that he was
fleeing from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the sea was growing worse and worse,
so they said to Jonah, “What must we do to you to calm this sea for
us?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Pick me up,” he answered, “and cast
me into the sea, so it may quiet down for you. For I know that I am
to blame for this violent storm that has come upon you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get
back to dry land, but they could not, for the sea was raging against
them more and more. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they cried out to the LORD: “Please,
O LORD, do not let us perish on account of this man’s life! Do not
charge us with innocent blood! For You, O LORD, have done as You
pleased.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, they picked up Jonah and cast him
into the sea, and the raging sea grew calm. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the men feared the LORD greatly, and
they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows to Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the LORD had appointed a great fish to
swallow Jonah, and Jonah spent three days and three nights in the
belly of the fish. </font>
