<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Wisdom and Folly</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>As dead flies bring a stench to the perfumer’s oil, </p><p class="indent"> so a little folly outweighs wisdom and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span>.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>A wise man’s heart inclines to the right, </p><p class="indent"> but the heart of a fool to the left.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Even as the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking, </p><p class="indent"> and he shows everyone that he is a fool.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>If the ruler’s temper flares against you, do not abandon your post, </p><p class="indent"> for calmness lays great offenses to rest.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>There is an evil I have seen under the sun—</p><p class="indent"> an error that proceeds from the ruler:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Folly is appointed to great heights, </p><p class="indent"> but the rich sit in lowly positions.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>I have seen slaves on horseback, </p><p class="indent"> while princes go on foot like slaves.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>He who digs a pit may fall into it, </p><p class="indent"> and he who breaches a wall may be bitten by a snake.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The one who quarries stones may be injured by them, </p><p class="indent"> and he who splits logs endangers himself.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>If the axe is dull and the blade unsharpened, </p><p class="indent"> more strength must be exerted, </p><p class="indent"> but skill produces success.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>If the snake bites before it is charmed, </p><p class="indent"> there is no profit for the charmer.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious, </p><p class="indent"> but the lips of a fool consume him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>The beginning of his talk is folly, </p><p class="indent"> and the end of his speech is evil madness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Yet the fool multiplies words. </p><p class="indent"> No one knows what is coming, </p><p class="indent"> and who can tell him what will come after him?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The toil of a fool wearies him, </p><p class="indent"> for he does not know the way to the city.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>Woe to you, O land whose king is a youth,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and whose princes feast in the morning.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Blessed are you, O land whose king is a son of nobles, </p><p class="indent"> and whose princes feast at the proper time—</p><p class="indent"> for strength and not for drunkenness.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>Through laziness the roof caves in, </p><p class="indent"> and in the hands of the idle, the house leaks.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>A feast is prepared for laughter, and wine makes life merry, </p><p class="indent"> but money is the answer for everything.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Do not curse the king even in your thoughts, </p><p class="indent"> or curse the rich even in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> bedroom, </p><p class="indent1"> for a bird of the air may carry your words, </p><p class="indent"> and a winged creature may report your speech.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a servant</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
