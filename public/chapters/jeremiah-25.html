<font ><b>Seventy Years of Captivity</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the word that came to Jeremiah
concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim
son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. So the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all
the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem as follows: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >From the thirteenth year of Josiah son
of Amon king of Judah until this very day—twenty-three years—the
word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you again and
again, but you have not listened. And the LORD has sent all His
servants the prophets to you again and again, but you have not
listened or inclined your ear to hear. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The prophets told you, ‘Turn now, each
of you, from your evil ways and deeds, and you can dwell in the land
that the LORD has given to you and your fathers forever and ever. Do
not follow other gods to serve and worship them, and do not provoke
Me to anger with the works of your hands. Then I will do you no
harm.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
‘<font >But to your own harm, you have not
listened to Me,’ declares the LORD, ‘so you have provoked Me to
anger with the works of your hands.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts
says: ‘Because you have not obeyed My words, behold, I will summon
all the families of the north, declares the LORD, and I will send for
My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, whom I will bring against
this land, against its residents, and against all the surrounding
nations. So I will devote them to destruction and make them an object
of horror and contempt, an everlasting desolation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, I will banish from them the
sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom,
the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. And this
whole land will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will
serve the king of Babylon for seventy years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when seventy years are complete, I
will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the
Chaldeans, for their guilt, declares the LORD, and I will make it an
everlasting desolation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I will bring upon that land all the words
I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which
Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. For many nations and
great kings will enslave them, and I will repay them according to
their deeds and according to the work of their hands.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the LORD, the God of Israel,
said to me: “Take from My hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and
make all the nations to whom I send you drink from it. And they will
drink and stagger and go out of their minds, because of the sword
that I will send among them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I took the cup from the LORD’s hand
and made all the nations drink from it, each one to whom the LORD had
sent me, to make them a ruin, an object of horror and contempt and
cursing, as they are to this day—Jerusalem and the cities of Judah,
its kings and officials; Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officials, his
leaders, and all his people; all the mixed tribes; all the kings of
Uz; all the kings of the Philistines: Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the
remnant of Ashdod; Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites; all the kings of
Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea; Dedan,
Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair; all the kings
of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed tribes who dwell in the
desert; all the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media; all the kings of the
north, both near and far, one after another—all the kingdoms on the
face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshach will
drink it too. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Then you are to tell them that this is
what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Drink, get drunk,
and vomit. Fall down and never get up again, because of the sword I
will send among you.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If they refuse to take the cup from your
hand and drink it, you are to tell them that this is what the LORD of
Hosts says: ‘You most certainly must drink it! For behold, I am
beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears My Name, so how
could you possibly go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I
am calling down a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth,
declares the LORD of Hosts.’ </font>
