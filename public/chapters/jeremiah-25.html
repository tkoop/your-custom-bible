<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Seventy Years of Captivity</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem as follows:
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>“From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day—twenty-three years—the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has come to me, and I have spoken to you again and again,<span class="fn">a</span>  but you have not listened.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has sent all His servants the prophets to you again and again,<span class="fn">b</span>  but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The prophets told you, ‘Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and deeds, and you can dwell in the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has given to you and your fathers forever and ever.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>‘But to your own harm, you have not listened to Me,’ declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, ‘so you have provoked Me to anger with the works of your hands.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: ‘Because you have not obeyed My words,
<span class="reftext">9</span>behold, I will summon all the families of the north, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, whom I will bring against this land, against its residents, and against all the surrounding nations. So I will devote them to destruction<span class="fn">c</span>  and make them an object of horror and contempt, an everlasting desolation.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Moreover, I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And this whole land will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But when seventy years are complete, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans,<span class="fn">d</span>  for their guilt, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and I will make it an everlasting desolation.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I will bring upon that land all the words I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
<span class="reftext">14</span>For many nations and great kings will enslave them, and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Cup of God’s Wrath</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from My hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink from it.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And they will drink and stagger and go out of their minds, because of the sword that I will send among them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So I took the cup from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s hand and made all the nations drink from it, each one to whom <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had sent me,
<span class="reftext">18</span>to make them a ruin, an object of horror and contempt and cursing, as they are to this day—Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and officials;
<span class="reftext">19</span>Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officials, his leaders, and all his people;
<span class="reftext">20</span>all the mixed tribes; all the kings of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines: Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
<span class="reftext">21</span>Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites;
<span class="reftext">22</span>all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea;
<span class="reftext">23</span>Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair;
<span class="reftext">24</span>all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed tribes who dwell in the desert;
<span class="reftext">25</span>all the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media;
<span class="reftext">26</span>all the kings of the north, both near and far, one after another—all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshach<span class="fn">e</span>  will drink it too.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>“Then you are to tell them that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Drink, get drunk, and vomit. Fall down and never get up again, because of the sword I will send among you.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink it, you are to tell them that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: ‘You most certainly must drink it!
<span class="reftext">29</span>For behold, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears My Name, so how could you possibly go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>So you are to prophesy all these words against them and say to them: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will roar from on high; </p><p class="indent"> He will raise His voice from His holy habitation. </p><p class="indent1"> He will roar loudly over His pasture; </p><p class="indent"> like those who tread the grapes, </p><p class="indent1"> He will call out with a shout </p><p class="indent"> against all the inhabitants of the earth.

</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Behold!

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Those slain by <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> on that day will be spread from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, gathered, or buried. They will be like dung lying on the ground.
</p><p class="hdg">The Cry of the Shepherds</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">34</span>Wail, you shepherds, and cry out; </p><p class="indent"> roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. </p><p class="indent1"> For the days of your slaughter have come; </p><p class="indent"> you will fall and be shattered like fine pottery.<span class="fn">f</span>
