<font >To the elect who are exiles of the

sanctified by the Spirit for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling
by His blood: </font>

<font >Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ! By His great mercy He has given us new birth into a
living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
and into an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and
unfading, reserved in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded
by God’s power for the salvation that is ready to be revealed in
the last time. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In this you greatly rejoice, though now
for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in various trials
so that the proven character of your faith—more precious than gold,
which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise,
glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Concerning this salvation, the prophets
who foretold the grace to come to you searched and investigated
carefully, trying to determine the time and setting to which the
Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when He predicted the
sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. </font>

<font >It was revealed to them that they were not
serving themselves, but you, when they foretold the things now
announced by those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit
sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore prepare your minds for action.
Be sober-minded. Set your hope fully on the grace to be given you at
the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, do not conform
to the passions of your former ignorance. But just as He who called
you is holy, so be holy in all you do, for it is written: “Be holy,
because I am holy.” </font>

<font >Since you call on a Father who judges each
one’s work impartially, conduct yourselves in reverent fear during
your stay as foreigners. For you know that it was not with perishable
things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty
way of life you inherited from your forefathers, but with the
precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or spot. He was
known before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in the
last times for your sake. </font>

obedience to the truth so that you have a genuine love for your

been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through
