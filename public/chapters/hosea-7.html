</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>But they fail to consider in their hearts </p><p class="indent"> that I remember all their evil. </p><p class="indent1"> Now their deeds are all around them; </p><p class="indent"> they are before My face.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>They delight the king with their evil, </p><p class="indent"> and the princes with their lies.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>They are all adulterers, </p><p class="indent"> like an oven heated by a baker </p><p class="indent1"> who needs not stoke the fire </p><p class="indent"> from the kneading to the rising of the dough.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The princes are inflamed with wine </p><p class="indent"> on the day of our king; </p><p class="indent1"> so he joins hands </p><p class="indent"> with those who mock him.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>All of them are hot as an oven, </p><p class="indent"> and they devour their rulers. </p><p class="indent1"> All their kings fall; </p><p class="indent"> not one of them calls upon Me.

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>So Ephraim has become like a silly, senseless dove—</p><p class="indent"> calling out to Egypt, then turning to Assyria.
