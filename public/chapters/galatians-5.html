</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Take notice: I, Paul, tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> that if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> at all.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Again I testify to every man who gets himself circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.
<span class="reftext">4</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> who are trying to be justified by the law have been severed from Christ; <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have fallen away from grace.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But by faith we eagerly await through the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> the hope of righteousness.
<span class="reftext">6</span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. All that matters is faith, expressed through love.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> were running so well. Who has obstructed <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from obeying the truth?
<span class="reftext">8</span>Such persuasion does not come from the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who calls <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">9</span>A little leaven works through the whole batch of dough.
<span class="reftext">10</span>I am confident in the Lord that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will take no other view. The one who is troubling <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will bear the <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span>, whoever he may be.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the <span class='spell ca'>offence</span><span class='spell gb'>offence</span><span class='spell us'>offense</span> of the cross has been abolished.
<span class="reftext">12</span>As for those who are agitating <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, I wish they would proceed to emasculate themselves!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, brothers, were called to freedom; but do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. Rather, serve one another in love.
<span class="reftext">14</span>The entire law is fulfilled in a single decree: “Love your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> as yourself.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> keep on biting and devouring one another, watch out, or <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be consumed by one another.

<span class="reftext">17</span>For the flesh craves what is contrary to the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, and the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> what is contrary to the flesh. They are opposed to each other, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not do what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> want.
<span class="reftext">18</span>But if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are led by the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are not under the law.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, and debauchery;
<span class="reftext">20</span>idolatry and sorcery; hatred, discord, jealousy, and rage; rivalries, divisions, factions,
<span class="reftext">21</span>and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, as I did before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But the fruit of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
<span class="reftext">23</span>gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Since we live by the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, let us walk in step with the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>.
