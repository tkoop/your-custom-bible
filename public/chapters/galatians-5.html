<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Freedom in Christ</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not be encumbered once more by a yoke of slavery.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Take notice: I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Again I testify to every man who gets himself circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.
<span class="reftext">4</span>You who are trying to be justified by the law have been severed from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the hope of righteousness.
<span class="reftext">6</span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. All that matters is faith, expressed through love.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>You were running so well. Who has obstructed you from obeying the truth?
<span class="reftext">8</span>Such persuasion does not come from the One who calls you.
<span class="reftext">9</span>A little leaven works through the whole batch of dough.
<span class="reftext">10</span>I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is troubling you will bear the judgment, whoever he may be.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.
<span class="reftext">12</span>As for those who are agitating you, I wish they would proceed to emasculate themselves!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>For you, brothers, were called to freedom; but do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. Rather, serve one another in love.
<span class="reftext">14</span>The entire law is fulfilled in a single decree: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But if you keep on biting and devouring one another, watch out, or you will be consumed by one another.
</p><p class="hdg">Walking by the Spirit<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Ezekiel 36:16–38; Romans 8:9–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For the flesh craves what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are opposed to each other, so that you do not do what you want.
<span class="reftext">18</span>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, and debauchery;
<span class="reftext">20</span>idolatry and sorcery; hatred, discord, jealousy, and rage; rivalries, divisions, factions,
<span class="reftext">21</span>and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
<span class="reftext">23</span>gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Since we live by the Spirit, let us walk in step with the Spirit.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying one another.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Leviticus 19:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
