<span class="reftext">2</span>God-fearing men buried Stephen and mourned deeply over him.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.
</p><p class="hdg">Philip in Samaria</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them.
<span class="reftext">6</span>The crowds gave their undivided attention to Philip’s message and to the signs they saw him perform.
<span class="reftext">7</span>With loud shrieks, unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, and many of the paralyzed and lame were healed.
<span class="reftext">8</span>So there was great joy in that city.
</p><p class="hdg">Simon the Sorcerer<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 18:9–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Prior to that time, a man named Simon had <span class='spell ca'>practised</span><span class='spell gb'>practised</span><span class='spell us'>practiced</span> sorcery in the city and astounded the people of Samaria. He claimed to be someone great,
<span class="reftext">10</span>and all the people, from the least to the greatest, heeded his words and said, “This man is the divine power called the <span class='cap'>Great</span><span class='nocap'>great</span><span class='bsb'>Great</span> Power.”
<span class="reftext">11</span>They paid close attention to him because he had astounded them for a long time with his sorcery.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But when they believed Philip as he preached the gospel of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Even Simon himself believed and was baptized. He followed Philip closely and was astounded by the great signs and miracles he observed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
<span class="reftext">15</span>On their arrival, they prayed for them to receive the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>.

<span class="reftext">17</span>Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>When Simon saw that the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money.
<span class="reftext">19</span>“Give me this power as well,” he said, “so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>But Peter replied, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!
<span class="reftext">21</span>You have no part or share in our ministry, because your heart is not right before God.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Repent, therefore, of your wickedness, and pray to the Lord. Perhaps <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> will forgive you for the intent of your heart.
<span class="reftext">23</span>For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and captive to iniquity.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have said may happen to me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>And after Peter and John had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many of the Samaritan villages.

<span class="reftext">27</span>So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official in charge of the entire treasury of Candace,<span class="fn">a</span>  queen of the Ethiopians. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship,
<span class="reftext">28</span>and on his return was sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>The <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> said to Philip, “Go over to that chariot and stay by it.”

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>“How can I,” he said, “unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>The eunuch was reading this passage of <span class='cap'>Scripture</span><span class='nocap'>scripture</span><span class='bsb'>Scripture</span>: </p><p class="indent1stline">“He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, </p><p class="indent"> and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, </p><p class="indent"> so <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> did not open <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> mouth.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>“Tell me,” said the eunuch, “who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Then Philip began with this very <span class='cap'>Scripture</span><span class='nocap'>scripture</span><span class='bsb'>Scripture</span> and told him the good news about Jesus.

<span class="reftext">38</span>And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.
