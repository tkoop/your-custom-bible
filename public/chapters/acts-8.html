<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Saul was there, giving approval to
Stephen’s death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On that day a great persecution broke out
against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were
scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. God-fearing men buried
Stephen and mourned deeply over him. But Saul began to destroy the
church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and
put them in prison. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Those who had been scattered preached the
word wherever they went. Philip went down to a city in Samaria and
proclaimed the Christ to them. The crowds gave their undivided
attention to Philip’s message and to the signs they saw him
perform. With loud shrieks, unclean spirits came out of many who were
possessed, and many of the paralyzed and lame were healed. So there
was great joy in that city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Prior to that time, a man named Simon had
practiced sorcery in the city and astounded the people of Samaria. He
claimed to be someone great, and all the people, from the least to
the greatest, heeded his words and said, “This man is the divine
power called the Great Power.” They paid close attention to him
because he had astounded them for a long time with his sorcery. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when they believed Philip as he
preached the gospel of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. Even Simon himself
believed and was baptized. He followed Philip closely and was
astounded by the great signs and miracles he observed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that
Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to
them. On their arrival, they prayed for them to receive the Holy
Spirit. For the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them; they
had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. Then Peter
and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Simon saw that the Spirit was given
through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them
money. “Give me this power as well,” he said, “so that everyone
on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Peter replied, “May your silver
perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God
with money! You have no part or share in our ministry, because your
heart is not right before God. Repent, therefore, of your wickedness,
and pray to the Lord. Perhaps He will forgive you for the intent of
your heart. For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and captive
to iniquity.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord
for me, so that nothing you have said may happen to me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And after Peter and John had testified and
spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching
the gospel in many of the Samaritan villages. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip,
“Get up and go south to the desert road that goes down from
Jerusalem to Gaza.” So he started out, and on his way he met an
Ethiopian eunuch, a court official in charge of the entire treasury
of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He had gone to Jerusalem to
worship, and on his return was sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah
the prophet. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to
that chariot and stay by it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Philip ran up and heard the man reading
Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?”
Philip asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">How can I,” he said, “unless
someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with
him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The eunuch was reading this passage of
Scripture: </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">He was led like a sheep to the
slaughter, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">and as a lamb before the shearer is
silent, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">so He did not open His mouth. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In His humiliation He was deprived of
justice. </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Who can recount His descendants? </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Tell me,” said the eunuch, “who is
the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Philip began with this very Scripture
and told him the good news about Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As they traveled along the road and came
to some water, the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is there
to prevent me from being baptized?” And he gave orders to stop the
chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water,
and Philip baptized him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When they came up out of the water, the
Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no
more, but went on his way rejoicing. But Philip appeared at Azotus
and traveled through that region, preaching the gospel in all the
towns until he came to Caesarea. </font>
