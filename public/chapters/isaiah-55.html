</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Why spend money on that which is not bread, </p><p class="indent"> and your labour on that which does not satisfy? </p><p class="indent1"> Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, </p><p class="indent"> and your soul will delight in the richest of foods.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>Incline your ear and come to Me; </p><p class="indent"> listen, so that your soul may live. </p><p class="indent1"> I will make with you an everlasting covenant—</p><p class="indent"> My loving devotion promised to David.<span class="fn">a</span>
