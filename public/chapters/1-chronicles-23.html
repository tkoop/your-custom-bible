<font >When David was old and full of years, he
installed his son Solomon as king over Israel. Then he gathered all
the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Levites thirty years of age or older
were counted, and the total number of men was 38,000. “Of these,”
said David, “24,000 are to oversee the work of the house of the
LORD, 6,000 are to be officers and judges, 4,000 are to be
gatekeepers, and 4,000 are to praise the LORD with the instruments I
have made for giving praise.” </font>

<font >And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina,
Jeush, and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei—four in all.
Jahath was the first and Zizah was the second; but Jeush and Beriah
did not have many sons, so they were counted as one family and
received a single assignment. </font>

<font >The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron
and his descendants were set apart forever to consecrate the most
holy things, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister before Him,
and to pronounce blessings in His name forever. As for Moses the man
of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi. </font>

<font >For according to the final instructions of
David, the Levites twenty years of age or older were counted, but
their duty was to assist the descendants of Aaron with the service of
the house of the LORD, being responsible for the courts and chambers,
the purification of all the holy things, and the work of the service
of the house of God, as well as for the rows of the showbread, the
fine flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread,
the baking, the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size. </font>

<font >They were also to stand every morning to
give thanks and praise to the LORD, and likewise in the evening.
Whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on the Sabbaths,
New Moons, and appointed feasts, they were to serve regularly before
the LORD in the numbers prescribed for them. So the Levites were to
carry out the responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting and the Holy
Place, and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, the
service of the house of the LORD. </font>
