<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Divisions of the Levites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When David was old and full of years, he installed his son Solomon as king over Israel.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Then he gathered all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>The Levites thirty years of age or older were counted, and the total number of men was 38,000.
<span class="reftext">4</span>“Of these,” said David,<span class="fn">a</span>  “24,000 are to oversee the work of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, 6,000 are to be officers and judges,
<span class="reftext">5</span>4,000 are to be gatekeepers, and 4,000 are to praise <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> with the instruments I have made for giving praise.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then David divided the Levites into divisions according to the sons of Levi: </p><p class="list1stline"> Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.
</p><p class="hdg">The Gershonites<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 3:21–26; Numbers 4:21–28)</span></p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>The Gershonites: Ladan<span class="fn">b</span>  and Shimei.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>The sons of Ladan: Jehiel<span class="fn">c</span>  the first, Zetham, and Joel—three in all.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran—three in all. These were the heads of the families of Ladan.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the sons of Shimei:<span class="fn">d</span>  Jahath, Zina,<span class="fn">e</span>  Jeush, and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei—four in all.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Jahath was the first and Zizah was the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they were counted as one family and received a single assignment.
</p><p class="hdg">The Kohathites<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 3:27–32; Numbers 4:1–20)</span></p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel—four in all.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were set apart forever to consecrate the most holy things, to burn incense before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, to minister before <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, and to pronounce blessings in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> name forever.
<span class="reftext">14</span>As for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>The descendants of Gershom: Shebuel was the first.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>The descendants of Eliezer: Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer did not have any other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>The sons of Izhar: Shelomith was the first.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>The sons of Hebron: Jeriah was the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>The sons of Uzziel: Micah was the first and Isshiah the second.
</p><p class="hdg">The Merarites<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 3:33–37; Numbers 4:29–33)</span></p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. </p><p class="list1stline"> The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Eleazar died without having any sons; he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth<span class="fn">f</span>—three in all.
</p><p class="hdg">Levite Duties Revised</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>These were the descendants of Levi by their families—the heads of families, registered individually by name—those twenty years of age or older who worked in the service of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>For David had said, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span>, the God of Israel, has given rest to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever.
<span class="reftext">26</span>So now the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles for its service.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>For according to the final instructions of David, the Levites twenty years of age or older were counted,
<span class="reftext">28</span>but their duty was to assist the descendants of Aaron with the service of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, being responsible for the courts and chambers, the purification of all the holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God,
<span class="reftext">29</span>as well as for the rows of the showbread, the fine flour for the grain offering, the wafers of unleavened bread, the baking, the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>They were also to stand every morning to give thanks and praise to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and likewise in the evening.
<span class="reftext">31</span>Whenever burnt offerings were presented to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> on the Sabbaths, <span class='cap'>New</span><span class='nocap'>new</span> <span class='cap'>Moons</span><span class='nocap'>moons</span>, and appointed feasts, they were to serve regularly before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> in the numbers prescribed for them.
