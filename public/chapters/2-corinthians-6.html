<span class="reftext">2</span>For He says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“In the time of <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> I heard you, </p><p class="indent"> and in the day of salvation I helped you.”<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> Behold, now is the time of <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span>; now is the day of salvation!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no one can discredit our ministry.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships, and calamities;
<span class="reftext">5</span>in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>, sleepless nights, and hunger;
<span class="reftext">6</span>in purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;
<span class="reftext">7</span>in truthful speech and in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;
<span class="reftext">8</span>through glory and dishonor, slander and praise; viewed as imposters, yet genuine;
<span class="reftext">9</span>as unknown, yet well-known; dying, and yet we live on; punished, yet not killed;
<span class="reftext">10</span>sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians. Our hearts are open wide.
<span class="reftext">12</span>It is not our affection, but yours, that is restrained.
<span class="reftext">13</span>As a fair exchange, I ask you as my children: Open wide your hearts also.
</p><p class="hdg">Do Not Be Unequally Yoked</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership can righteousness have with wickedness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?
<span class="reftext">15</span>What harmony is there between Christ and Belial?<span class="fn">c</span>  Or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?
<span class="reftext">16</span>What agreement can exist between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God.
