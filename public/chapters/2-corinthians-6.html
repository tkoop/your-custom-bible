<font ><b>Paul’s Hardships and God’s Grace</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As God’s fellow workers, then, we urge
you not to receive God’s grace in vain. For He says: </font>

“<font >In the time of favor I heard you, </font>

<font >Behold, now is the time of favor; now is

<font >We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so
that no one can discredit our ministry. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Rather, as servants of God we commend
ourselves in every way: in great endurance; in troubles, hardships,
and calamities; in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in labor,
sleepless nights, and hunger; in purity, knowledge, patience, and
kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love; in truthful speech
and in the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness in the
right hand and in the left; through glory and dishonor, slander and
praise; viewed as imposters, yet genuine; as unknown, yet well-known;
dying, and yet we live on; punished, yet not killed; sorrowful, yet
always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet
possessing everything. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians.
Our hearts are open wide. It is not our affection, but yours, that is
restrained. As a fair exchange, I ask you as my children: Open wide
your hearts also. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not be unequally yoked with
unbelievers. For what partnership can righteousness have with
wickedness? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? What
harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what does a believer
have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement can exist between
the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God.
