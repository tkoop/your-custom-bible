<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Israel’s Rebellion in Egypt</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the seventh year, on the tenth day of the fifth month, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and they sat down before me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">3</span>“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: Have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> come to inquire of <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>? As surely as I live, I will not be consulted by <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, declares the Lord GOD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Will you judge them, will you judge them, son of man? Confront them with the abominations of their fathers
<span class="reftext">5</span>and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span> known to them in the land of Egypt. With an uplifted hand I said to them, ‘I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>On that day I swore to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And I said to them: ‘Each of you must throw away the abominations before his eyes, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But they rebelled against <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and refused to listen. None of them cast away the abominations before their eyes, and they did not forsake the idols of Egypt. So I resolved to pour out <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> wrath upon them and vent <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> anger against them in the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">9</span>But I acted for the sake of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were living, in whose sight I had revealed <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span> to Israel by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.
</p><p class="hdg">Israel’s Rebellion in the Wilderness</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So I brought them out of the land of Egypt and led them into the wilderness.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And I gave them <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes and made known to them <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances—for the man who does these things will live by them.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">12</span>I also gave them <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> Sabbaths as a sign between us, so that they would know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> who sanctifies them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Yet the house of Israel rebelled against <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> in the wilderness. They did not follow <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes and they rejected <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances—though the man who does these things will live by them—and they utterly profaned <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> Sabbaths. Then I resolved to pour out <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> wrath upon them and put an end to them in the wilderness.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But I acted for the sake of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Moreover, with an uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that I had given them—a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands—
<span class="reftext">16</span>because they kept rejecting <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances, refusing to walk in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes, and profaning <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> Sabbaths; for their hearts continually went after their idols.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or bring them to an end in the wilderness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>In the wilderness I said to their children: ‘Do not walk in the statutes of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols.
<span class="reftext">19</span>I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God; walk in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes, keep <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances, and practice them.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Keep <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>But the children rebelled against <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>. They did not walk in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes or carefully observe <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances—though the man who does these things will live by them—and they profaned <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> Sabbaths. So I resolved to pour out <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> wrath upon them and vent <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> anger against them in the wilderness.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But I withheld <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> hand and acted for the sake of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>However, with an uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands.
<span class="reftext">24</span>For they did not practice <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances, but they rejected <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes and profaned <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> Sabbaths, fixing their eyes on the idols of their fathers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>I also gave them over to statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And I pronounced them unclean through their gifts—the sacrifice of every firstborn in the fire—so that I might devastate them, in order that they would know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="hdg">Israel’s Rebellion in the Land</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: In this way also <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers blasphemed <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> by their unfaithfulness against <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
<span class="reftext">28</span>When I brought them into the land that I swore to give them and they saw any high hill or leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices, presented offerings that provoked <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, sent up their fragrant incense, and poured out their drink offerings.
<span class="reftext">29</span>So I asked them: ‘What is this high place to which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> go?’ </p><p class="reg1">(And to this day it is called Bamah.<span class="fn">b</span>)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Therefore tell the house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: Will <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> defile yourselves the way <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers did, prostituting yourselves with their abominations?
<span class="reftext">31</span>When <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> offer <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> gifts, sacrificing <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sons in the fire,<span class="fn">c</span>  <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>When <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> say, ‘Let us be like the nations, like the peoples of the lands, serving wood and stone,’ what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have in mind will never come to pass.

<span class="reftext">35</span>And I will bring <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> into the wilderness of the nations, where I will enter into <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> face to face.

<span class="reftext">37</span>I will make you pass under the rod and will bring you into the bond of the covenant.
<span class="reftext">38</span>And I will purge you of those who rebel and transgress against <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
