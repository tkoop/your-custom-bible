<font ><b>Israel’s Rebellion</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the seventh year, on the tenth day of
the fifth month, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the
LORD, and they sat down before me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and tell them
that this is what the Lord GOD says: Have you come to inquire of Me?
As surely as I live, I will not be consulted by you, declares the
Lord GOD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Will you judge them, will you judge them,
son of man? Confront them with the abominations of their fathers and
tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: On the day I chose
Israel, I swore an oath to the descendants of the house of Jacob and
made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt. With an uplifted hand
I said to them, ‘I am the LORD your God.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On that day I swore to bring them out of
the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a
land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands. And I said
to them: ‘Each of you must throw away the abominations before his
eyes, and you must not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I
am the LORD your God.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But they rebelled against Me and refused
to listen. None of them cast away the abominations before their eyes,
and they did not forsake the idols of Egypt. So I resolved to pour
out My wrath upon them and vent My anger against them in the land of
Egypt. But I acted for the sake of My name, that it should not be
profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were living, in
whose sight I had revealed Myself to Israel by bringing them out of
the land of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I brought them out of the land of Egypt
and led them into the wilderness. And I gave them My statutes and
made known to them My ordinances—for the man who does these things
will live by them. I also gave them My Sabbaths as a sign between us,
so that they would know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet the house of Israel rebelled against
Me in the wilderness. They did not follow My statutes and they
rejected My ordinances—though the man who does these things will
live by them—and they utterly profaned My Sabbaths. Then I resolved
to pour out My wrath upon them and put an end to them in the
wilderness. But I acted for the sake of My name, so that it would not
be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought
them out. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, with an uplifted hand I swore to
them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land that
I had given them—a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of
all lands— because they kept rejecting My ordinances, refusing to
walk in My statutes, and profaning My Sabbaths; for their hearts
continually went after their idols. Yet I looked on them with pity
and did not destroy them or bring them to an end in the wilderness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the wilderness I said to their
children: ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers or keep
their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols. I am the LORD
your God; walk in My statutes, keep My ordinances, and practice them.
Keep My Sabbaths holy, that they may be a sign between us, so that
you may know that I am the LORD your God.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the children rebelled against Me. They
did not walk in My statutes or carefully observe My ordinances—though
the man who does these things will live by them—and they profaned
My Sabbaths. So I resolved to pour out My wrath upon them and vent My
anger against them in the wilderness. But I withheld My hand and
acted for the sake of My name, so that it would not be profaned in
the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >However, with an uplifted hand I swore to
them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations
and disperse them throughout the lands. For they did not practice My
ordinances, but they rejected My statutes and profaned My Sabbaths,
fixing their eyes on the idols of their fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I also gave them over to statutes that
were not good and ordinances by which they could not live. And I
pronounced them unclean through their gifts—the sacrifice of every
firstborn in the fire—so that I might devastate them, in order that
they would know that I am the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, son of man, speak to the house
of Israel, and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: In this
way also your fathers blasphemed Me by their unfaithfulness against
Me. When I brought them into the land that I swore to give them and
they saw any high hill or leafy tree, there they offered their
sacrifices, presented offerings that provoked Me, sent up their
fragrant incense, and poured out their drink offerings. So I asked
them: ‘What is this high place to which you go?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >(And to this day it is called Bamah.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore tell the house of Israel that
this is what the Lord GOD says: Will you defile yourselves the way
your fathers did, prostituting yourselves with their abominations?
When you offer your gifts, sacrificing your sons in the fire, you
continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. So
should I be consulted by you, O house of Israel? As surely as I live,
declares the Lord GOD, I will not be consulted by you! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When you say, ‘Let us be like the
nations, like the peoples of the lands, serving wood and stone,’
what you have in mind will never come to pass. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As surely as I live, declares the Lord
GOD, with a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and outpoured wrath I
will rule over you. With a strong hand, an outstretched arm, and
outpoured wrath I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you
from the lands to which you have been scattered. And I will bring you
into the wilderness of the nations, where I will enter into judgment
with you face to face. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Just as I entered into judgment with your
fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into
judgment with you, declares the Lord GOD. I will make you pass under
the rod and will bring you into the bond of the covenant. And I will
purge you of those who rebel and transgress against Me. I will bring
them out of the land in which they dwell, but they will not enter the
land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And as for you, O house of Israel, this is
what the Lord GOD says: Go and serve your idols, every one of you.
But afterward, you will surely listen to Me, and you will no longer
defile My holy name with your gifts and idols. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For on My holy mountain, the high mountain
of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, there the whole house of Israel,
all of them, will serve Me in the land. There I will accept them and
will require your offerings and choice gifts, along with all your
holy sacrifices. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When I bring you from the peoples and
gather you from the lands to which you have been scattered, I will
accept you as a pleasing aroma. And I will show My holiness through
you in the sight of the nations. Then you will know that I am the
LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the land that I swore
to give your fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There you will remember your ways and all
the deeds with which you have defiled yourselves, and you will loathe
yourselves for all the evils you have done. Then you will know, O
house of Israel, that I am the LORD, when I have dealt with you for
the sake of My name and not according to your wicked ways and corrupt
acts, declares the Lord GOD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, set your face toward the south, preach against
it, and prophesy against the forest of the Negev. Say to the forest
of the Negev: Hear the word of the LORD! This is what the Lord GOD
says: I am about to ignite in you a fire, and it will devour all your
trees, both green and dry. The blazing flame will not be quenched,
and by it every face from south to north will be scorched. Then all
people will see that I, the LORD, have kindled it; it will not be
quenched.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD, they are
saying of me, ‘Is he not just telling parables?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
