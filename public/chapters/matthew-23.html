<font >Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His
disciples: <font color="#a80000">“The scribes and Pharisees sit in
Moses’ seat. So practice and observe everything they tell you. But
do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.
They tie up heavy, burdensome loads and lay them on men’s
shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to
move them.</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >All their deeds are
done for men to see. They broaden their phylacteries and lengthen
their tassels. They love the places of honor at banquets, the chief
seats in the synagogues, the greetings in the marketplaces, and the
title of ‘Rabbi’ by which they are addressed. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But you are not to
be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all
brothers. And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have
one Father, who is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors,
for you have one Instructor, the Christ. The greatest among you shall
be your servant. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and
whoever humbles himself will be exalted. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Woe to you, scribes
and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in
men’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let in those
who wish to enter. </font></font>

single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a
son of hell as you are. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Woe to you, blind
guides! You say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing;
but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his
oath.’ You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple
that makes it sacred? And you say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar,
it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound
by his oath.’ You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the
altar that makes it sacred? So then, he who swears by the altar
swears by it and by everything on it. And he who swears by the temple
swears by it and by the One who dwells in it. And he who swears by
heaven swears by God’s throne and by the One who sits on it. </font></font>

and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You pay tithes of mint, dill, and
cumin. But you have disregarded the weightier matters of the law:
justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practiced the
latter, without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain
out a gnat but swallow a camel. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Woe to you, scribes

look beautiful on the outside, but on the inside are full of dead
men’s bones and every kind of impurity. In the same way, on the
outside you appear to be righteous, but on the inside you are full of
hypocrisy and wickedness. </font></font>

decorate the monuments of the righteous. And you say, ‘If we had
lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners
with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’ So you testify
against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the
prophets. Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your fathers. You
snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape the sentence of
hell? </font></font>

will kill and crucify, and others you will flog in your synagogues
and persecute in town after town. And so upon you will come all the
righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to
the blood of Zechariah son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between
the temple and the altar. Truly I tell you, all these things will
come upon this generation. </font></font>

Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her, how
often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen
gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling! Look,
your house is left to you desolate. For I tell you that you will not
see Me again until you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of
the Lord.’” </font></font>
