disciples: <font color="#a80000">“The scribes and Pharisees sit in
Moses’ seat. So practice and observe everything they tell you. But
do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.
They tie up heavy, burdensome loads and lay them on men’s
shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to
move them.</font> </font>

be your servant. For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and
whoever humbles himself will be exalted. </font></font>

it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound

altar that makes it sacred? So then, he who swears by the altar
swears by it and by everything on it. And he who swears by the temple
swears by it and by the One who dwells in it. And he who swears by
heaven swears by God’s throne and by the One who sits on it. </font></font>
