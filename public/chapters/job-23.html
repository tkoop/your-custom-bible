</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Even today my complaint is bitter. </p><p class="indent"> His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>If only I knew where to find Him, </p><p class="indent"> so that I could go to His seat.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I would plead my case before Him </p><p class="indent"> and fill my mouth with arguments.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>I would learn how He would answer, </p><p class="indent"> and consider what He would say.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Would He contend with me in His great power? </p><p class="indent"> No, He would certainly take note of me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then an upright man could reason with Him, </p><p class="indent"> and I would be delivered forever from my Judge.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>If I go east, He is not there, </p><p class="indent"> and if I go west, I cannot find Him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>When He is at work in the north, I cannot behold Him; </p><p class="indent"> when He turns to the south, I cannot see Him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Yet He knows the way I have taken; </p><p class="indent"> when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>My feet have followed in His tracks; </p><p class="indent"> I have kept His way without turning aside.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>I have not departed from the command of His lips; </p><p class="indent"> I have treasured the words of His mouth </p><p class="indent"> more than my daily bread.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>But He is unchangeable, and who can oppose Him? </p><p class="indent"> He does what He desires.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>For He carries out His decree against me, </p><p class="indent"> and He has many such plans.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Therefore I am terrified in His presence; </p><p class="indent"> when I consider this, I fear Him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>God has made my heart faint; </p><p class="indent"> the Almighty has terrified me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, </p><p class="indent"> by the thick darkness that covers my face.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
