<span class="reftext">2</span>“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are now prophesying. Tell those who prophesy out of their own imagination: Hear the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>!
<span class="reftext">3</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, yet have seen nothing.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Your prophets, O Israel, are like foxes among the ruins.
<span class="reftext">5</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> did not go up to the gaps or restore the wall around the house of Israel so that it would stand in the battle on the <span class='cap'>Day</span><span class='nocap'>day</span> of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>They see false visions and speak lying divinations. They claim, ‘Thus declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,’ when <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> did not send them; yet they wait for the <span class='spell ca'>fulfillment</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfilment</span><span class='spell us'>fulfillment</span> of their message.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Haven’t <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> seen a false vision and spoken a lying divination when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> proclaim, ‘Thus declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,’ even though I have not spoken?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have uttered vain words and seen false visions, I am against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, declares the Lord GOD.
<span class="reftext">9</span>My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and speak lying divinations. They will not belong to the council of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people or be recorded in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will know that I am the Lord GOD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Because they have led <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people astray, saying, ‘Peace,’ when there is no peace, and whitewashing any flimsy wall that is built,
<span class="reftext">11</span>tell those whitewashing the wall that it will fall. Rain will come in torrents, I will send hailstones plunging down, and a windstorm will burst forth.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Surely when the wall has fallen, you will not be asked, ‘Where is the whitewash with which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> covered it?’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: In <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> wrath I will release a windstorm, and in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> anger torrents of rain and hail will fall with destructive fury.
<span class="reftext">14</span>I will tear down the wall <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> whitewashed and level it to the ground, so that its foundation is exposed. The city will fall, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be destroyed within it. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And after I have vented <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> wrath against the wall and against those who whitewashed it, I will say to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>: ‘The wall is gone, and so are those who whitewashed it—
<span class="reftext">16</span>those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw a vision of peace for her when there was no peace, declares the Lord GOD.’
</p><p class="hdg">Reproof of False Prophetesses</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Now, O son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own imagination. Prophesy against them
<span class="reftext">18</span>and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: Woe to the women who sew magic charms on their wrists and make veils for the heads of people of every height, in order to ensnare their souls. Will <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> ensnare the souls of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people but preserve <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> own?
<span class="reftext">19</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have profaned <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> among <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people for handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. By lying to <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people who would listen, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have killed those who should not have died and spared those who should not have lived.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: See, I am against the magic charms with which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> ensnare souls like birds, and I will tear them from <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> arms. So I will free the souls <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have ensnared like birds.
<span class="reftext">21</span>I will also tear off <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> veils and deliver <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people from your hands, so that they will no longer be prey in your hands. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Because you have disheartened the righteous with your lies, even though I have caused them no grief, and because you have encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil ways to save their lives,
<span class="reftext">23</span>therefore you will no longer see false visions <span class='spell ca'>or practise</span><span class='spell gb'>or practise</span><span class='spell us'>or practice</span> divination. I will deliver <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people from your hands. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
