<font ><b>Reproof of False Prophets</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who
are now prophesying. Tell those who prophesy out of their own
imagination: Hear the word of the LORD! This is what the Lord GOD
says: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, yet
have seen nothing. Your prophets, O Israel, are like foxes among the
ruins. You did not go up to the gaps or restore the wall around the
house of Israel so that it would stand in the battle on the Day of
the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They see false visions and speak lying
divinations. They claim, ‘Thus declares the LORD,’ when the LORD
did not send them; yet they wait for the fulfillment of their
message. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Haven’t you seen a false vision and
spoken a lying divination when you proclaim, ‘Thus declares the
LORD,’ even though I have not spoken? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
Because you have uttered vain words and seen false visions, I am
against you, declares the Lord GOD. My hand will be against the
prophets who see false visions and speak lying divinations. They will
not belong to the council of My people or be recorded in the register
of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then
you will know that I am the Lord GOD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because they have led My people astray,
saying, ‘Peace,’ when there is no peace, and whitewashing any
flimsy wall that is built, tell those whitewashing the wall that it
will fall. Rain will come in torrents, I will send hailstones
plunging down, and a windstorm will burst forth. Surely when the wall
has fallen, you will not be asked, ‘Where is the whitewash with
which you covered it?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
In My wrath I will release a windstorm, and in My anger torrents of
rain and hail will fall with destructive fury. I will tear down the
wall you whitewashed and level it to the ground, so that its
foundation is exposed. The city will fall, and you will be destroyed
within it. Then you will know that I am the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And after I have vented My wrath against
the wall and against those who whitewashed it, I will say to you:
‘The wall is gone, and so are those who whitewashed it— those
prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw a vision of
peace for her when there was no peace, declares the Lord GOD.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now, O son of man, set your face against
the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own
imagination. Prophesy against them and tell them that this is what
the Lord GOD says: Woe to the women who sew magic charms on their
wrists and make veils for the heads of people of every height, in
order to ensnare their souls. Will you ensnare the souls of My people
but preserve your own? You have profaned Me among My people for
handfuls of barley and scraps of bread. By lying to My people who
would listen, you have killed those who should not have died and
spared those who should not have lived. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
See, I am against the magic charms with which you ensnare souls like
birds, and I will tear them from your arms. So I will free the souls
you have ensnared like birds. I will also tear off your veils and
deliver My people from your hands, so that they will no longer be
prey in your hands. Then you will know that I am the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because you have disheartened the
righteous with your lies, even though I have caused them no grief,
and because you have encouraged the wicked not to turn from their
evil ways to save their lives, therefore you will no longer see false
visions or practice divination. I will deliver My people from your
hands. Then you will know that I am the LORD.” </font>
