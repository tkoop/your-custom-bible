<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Call to Justice and Mercy</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Chislev.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech, along with their men,<span class="fn">b</span>  to plead before the LORD
<span class="reftext">3</span>by asking the priests of the house of the LORD of Hosts, as well as the prophets, “Should I weep and fast in the fifth month, as I have done these many years?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">5</span>“Ask all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for these seventy years, was it really for Me that you fasted?
<span class="reftext">6</span>And when you were eating and drinking, were you not doing so simply for yourselves?
<span class="reftext">7</span>Are these not the words that the LORD proclaimed through the earlier prophets, when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were populous and prosperous, and the Negev and the foothills<span class="fn">c</span>  were inhabited?’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,
<span class="reftext">9</span>“This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Administer true justice. Show loving devotion<span class="fn">d</span>  and compassion to one another.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. And do not plot evil in your hearts against one another.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder; they stopped up their ears from hearing.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">12</span>They made their hearts like flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the LORD of Hosts had sent by His Spirit through the earlier prophets. Therefore great anger came from the LORD of Hosts.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And just as I had called and they would not listen, so when they called I would not listen, says the LORD of Hosts.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations that they had not known, and the land was left desolate behind them so that no one could come or go. Thus they turned the pleasant land into a desolation.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Chislev</i> is the ninth month of the Hebrew lunar calendar, usually occurring within the months of November and December.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Bethel-sharezer had sent Regem-melech, along with his men,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Shephelah</i> or <i class="calibre6">lowlands</i>; that is, the western foothills of Judea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">chesed</i> are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as <i class="calibre6">loving devotion</i>; the range of meaning includes <i class="calibre6">love</i>, <i class="calibre6">goodness</i>, <i class="calibre6">kindness</i>, <i class="calibre6">faithfulness</i>, and <i class="calibre6">mercy</i>, as well as <i class="calibre6">loyalty to a covenant</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">they made their ears too heavy to hear</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
