<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the fourth year of King Darius, the
word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth
month, the month of Chislev. Now the people of Bethel had sent
Sharezer and Regem-melech, along with their men, to plead before the
LORD by asking the priests of the house of the LORD of Hosts, as well
as the prophets, “Should I weep and fast in the fifth month, as I
have done these many years?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the word of the LORD of Hosts came to
me, saying, “Ask all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When
you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for these
seventy years, was it really for Me that you fasted? And when you
were eating and drinking, were you not doing so simply for
yourselves? Are these not the words that the LORD proclaimed through
the earlier prophets, when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were
populous and prosperous, and the Negev and the foothills were
inhabited?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the word of the LORD came to
Zechariah, saying, “This is what the LORD of Hosts says:
‘Administer true justice. Show loving devotion and compassion to
one another. Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the
foreigner or the poor. And do not plot evil in your hearts against
one another.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But they refused to pay attention and
turned a stubborn shoulder; they stopped up their ears from hearing.
They made their hearts like flint and would not listen to the law or
to the words that the LORD of Hosts had sent by His Spirit through
the earlier prophets. Therefore great anger came from the LORD of
Hosts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And just as I had called and they would
not listen, so when they called I would not listen, says the LORD of
Hosts. But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations
that they had not known, and the land was left desolate behind them
so that no one could come or go. Thus they turned the pleasant land
into a desolation.” </font>
