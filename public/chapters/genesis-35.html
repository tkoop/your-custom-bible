<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jacob Returns to Bethel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and settle there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>So Jacob told his household and all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Purify yourselves and change your garments.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then let us arise and go to Bethel. I will build an altar there to God, who answered me in my day of distress. He has been with me wherever I have gone.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So they gave Jacob all their foreign gods and all their earrings, and Jacob buried them under the oak<span class="fn">a</span>  near Shechem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>As they set out, a terror from God fell over the surrounding cities, so that they did not pursue Jacob’s sons.
<span class="reftext">6</span>So Jacob and everyone with him arrived in Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.
<span class="reftext">7</span>There Jacob built an altar, and he called that place El-bethel,<span class="fn">b</span>  because it was there that God had revealed Himself to Jacob as he fled from his brother.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak<span class="fn">c</span>  below Bethel. So Jacob named it Allon-bachuth.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>After Jacob had returned from Paddan-aram,<span class="fn">e</span>  God appeared to him again and blessed him.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And God said to him, “Though your name is Jacob,<span class="fn">f</span>  you will no longer be called Jacob. Instead, your name will be Israel.<span class="fn">g</span>” So God named him Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And God told him, “I am God Almighty.<span class="fn">h</span>  Be fruitful and multiply. A nation—even a company of nations—shall come from you, and kings shall descend from you.
<span class="reftext">12</span>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then God went up from the place where He had spoken with him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God had spoken with him—a stone marker—and he poured out a drink offering on it and anointed it with oil.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Benjamin Born, Rachel Dies</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Later, they set out from Bethel, and while they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labour was difficult.
<span class="reftext">17</span>During her severe labour, the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you are having another son.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And with her last breath—for she was dying—she named him Ben-oni.<span class="fn">j</span>  But his father called him Benjamin.<span class="fn">k</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
<span class="reftext">20</span>Jacob set up a pillar on her grave; it marks Rachel’s tomb to this day.
</p><p class="hdg">The Sons of Jacob<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 2:1–2)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Israel again set out and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder.
<span class="reftext">22</span>While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it. </p><p class="reg1"> Jacob had twelve sons:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>The sons of Leah were Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>The sons of Rachel’s maidservant Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>And the sons of Leah’s maidservant Zilpah were Gad and Asher. </p><p class="reg1"> These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
</p><p class="hdg">The Death of Isaac</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Jacob returned to his father Isaac at Mamre, near Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>And Isaac lived 180 years.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">terebinth</i> or <i class="calibre6">great tree</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">El-bethel</i> means <i class="calibre6">God of Bethel</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">great tree</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Allon-bacuth</i> means <i class="calibre6">oak of weeping</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, northwest Mesopotamia; also in verse 26<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">Jacob</i> means <i class="calibre6">he grasps the heel</i> or <i class="calibre6">he deceives</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">Israel</i> means <i class="calibre6">he struggles with God</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">El-Shaddai</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> <i class="calibre6">Bethel</i> means <i class="calibre6">house of God</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> <i class="calibre6">Ben-oni</i> could mean <i class="calibre6">son of my sorrow</i> or <i class="calibre6">son of my strength</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> <i class="calibre6">Benjamin</i> means <i class="calibre6">son of my right hand</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
