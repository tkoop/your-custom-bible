<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Love</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a ringing gong or a clanging cymbal.
<span class="reftext">2</span>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have absolute faith so as to move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
<span class="reftext">3</span>If I give all I possess to the poor and exult in the surrender of my body,<span class="fn">a</span>  but have not love, I gain nothing.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
<span class="reftext">5</span>It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no account of wrongs.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Love takes no pleasure in evil, but rejoices in the truth.
<span class="reftext">7</span>It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be restrained; where there is knowledge, it will be dismissed.
<span class="reftext">9</span>For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
<span class="reftext">10</span>but when the perfect comes, the partial passes away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside childish ways.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Now we see but a dim <span class='spell ca'>reflection</span><span class='spell gb'>reflection, reflexion</span><span class='spell us'>reflection</span> as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> SBL, NE, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">surrender my body to be burned</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
