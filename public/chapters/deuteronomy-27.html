</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And on the day you cross the Jordan into the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is giving you, set up large stones and coat them with plaster.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And when you have crossed the Jordan, you are to set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I am commanding you today, and you are to coat them with plaster.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Moreover, you are to build there an altar to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, an altar of stones. You must not use any iron tool on them.
<span class="reftext">6</span>You shall build the altar of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God with uncut stones and offer upon it burnt offerings to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.
<span class="reftext">7</span>There you are to sacrifice your peace offerings, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And you shall write distinctly upon these stones all the words of this law.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel: “Be silent, O Israel, and listen! This day you have become the people of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.
<span class="reftext">10</span>You shall therefore obey the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God and follow His commandments and statutes I am giving you today.”
