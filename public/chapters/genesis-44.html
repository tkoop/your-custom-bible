<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Joseph instructed his steward: “Fill
the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each
one’s silver in the mouth of his sack. Put my cup, the silver one,
in the mouth of the youngest one’s sack, along with the silver for
his grain.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the steward did as Joseph had
instructed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At daybreak, the men were sent on their
way with their donkeys. They had not gone far from the city when
Joseph told his steward, “Pursue the men at once, and when you
overtake them, ask, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil? Is this
not the cup my master drinks from and uses for divination? What you
have done is wicked!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the steward overtook them, he relayed
these words to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Why does my lord say these things?”
they asked. “Your servants could not possibly do such a thing. We
even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found
in the mouths of our sacks. Why would we steal silver or gold from
your master’s house? If any of your servants is found to have it,
he must die, and the rest will become slaves of my lord.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">As you say,” replied the steward.
“But only the one who is found with the cup will be my slave, and
the rest of you shall be free of blame.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So each one quickly lowered his sack to
the ground and opened it. The steward searched, beginning with the
oldest and ending with the youngest—and the cup was found in
Benjamin’s sack. Then they all tore their clothes, loaded their
donkeys, and returned to the city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Judah and his brothers arrived at
Joseph’s house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground
before him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">What is this deed you have done?”
Joseph declared. “Do you not know that a man like me can surely
divine the truth?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">What can we say to my lord?” Judah
replied. “How can we plead? How can we justify ourselves? God has
exposed the iniquity of your servants. We are now my lord’s
slaves—both we and the one who was found with the cup.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Joseph replied, “Far be it from me
to do this. The man who was found with the cup will be my slave. The
rest of you may return to your father in peace.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Judah approached Joseph and said,
“Sir, please let your servant speak personally to my lord. Do not
be angry with your servant, for you are equal to Pharaoh himself. My
lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And we answered, ‘We have an elderly
father and a younger brother, the child of his old age. The boy’s
brother is dead. He is the only one of his mother’s sons left, and
his father loves him.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then you told your servants, ‘Bring him
down to me so that I can see him for myself.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot
leave his father. If he were to leave, his father would die.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But you said to your servants, ‘Unless
your younger brother comes down with you, you will not see my face
again.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when we returned to your servant my
father, we relayed your words to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then our father said, ‘Go back and buy
us some food.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But we answered, ‘We cannot go down
there unless our younger brother goes with us. So if our younger
brother is not with us, we cannot see the man.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And your servant my father said to us,
‘You know that my wife bore me two sons. When one of them was gone,
I said: “Surely he has been torn to pieces.” And I have not seen
him since. Now if you also take this one from me and harm comes to
him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So if the boy is not with us when I return
to your servant, and if my father, whose life is wrapped up in the
boy’s life, sees that the boy is not with us, he will die. Then
your servants will have brought the gray hair of your servant our
father down to Sheol in sorrow. Indeed, your servant guaranteed the
boy’s safety to my father, saying, ‘If I do not return him to
you, I will bear the guilt before you, my father, all my life.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now please let your servant stay here as
my lord’s slave in place of the boy. Let him return with his
brothers. For how can I go back to my father without the boy? I could
not bear to see the misery that would overwhelm him.” </font>
