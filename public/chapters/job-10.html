</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>I will say to God: </p><p class="indent"> Do not condemn me! </p><p class="indent"> Let me know why You prosecute me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Does it please You to oppress me, </p><p class="indent"> to reject the work of Your hands </p><p class="indent"> and favour the schemes of the wicked?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Do You have eyes of flesh? </p><p class="indent"> Do You see as man sees?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Are Your days like those of a mortal, </p><p class="indent"> or Your years like those of a man,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>that You should seek my iniquity </p><p class="indent"> and search out my sin—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>though You know that I am not guilty, </p><p class="indent"> and there is no deliverance from Your hand?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Your hands shaped me and altogether formed me. </p><p class="indent"> Would You now turn and destroy me?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Please remember that You molded me like clay. </p><p class="indent"> Would You now return me to dust?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Did You not pour me out like milk, </p><p class="indent"> and curdle me like cheese?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>You clothed me with skin and flesh, </p><p class="indent"> and knit me together with bones and sinews.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>You have granted me life and loving devotion,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and Your care has preserved my spirit.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Yet You concealed these things in Your heart, </p><p class="indent"> and I know that this was in Your mind:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>If I sinned, You would take note, </p><p class="indent"> and would not acquit me of my iniquity.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>If I am guilty, woe to me! </p><p class="indent"> And even if I am righteous, I cannot lift my head. </p><p class="indent1"> I am full of shame </p><p class="indent"> and aware of my affliction.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Should I hold my head high, </p><p class="indent"> You would hunt me like a lion, </p><p class="indent"> and again display Your power against me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>You produce new witnesses against me </p><p class="indent"> and multiply Your anger toward me. </p><p class="indent1"> Hardships assault me </p><p class="indent"> in wave after wave.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>Why then did You bring me from the womb? </p><p class="indent"> Oh, that I had died, and no eye had seen me!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>If only I had never come to be, </p><p class="indent"> but had been carried from the womb to the grave.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Are my days not few? </p><p class="indent"> Withdraw from me, that I may have a little comfort,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>before I go—never to return—</p><p class="indent"> to a land of darkness and gloom,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>to a land of utter darkness, </p><p class="indent"> of deep shadow and disorder, </p><p class="indent"> where even the light is like darkness.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">chesed</i> are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as <i class="calibre6">loving devotion</i>; the range of meaning includes <i class="calibre6">love</i>, <i class="calibre6">goodness</i>, <i class="calibre6">kindness</i>, <i class="calibre6">faithfulness</i>, and <i class="calibre6">mercy</i>, as well as <i class="calibre6">loyalty to a covenant</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
