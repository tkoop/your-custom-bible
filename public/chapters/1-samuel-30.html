<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font ><b>David Destroys the Amalekites</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the third day David and his men arrived
in Ziklag, and the Amalekites had raided the Negev, attacked Ziklag,
and burned it down. They had taken captive the women and all who were
there, both young and old. They had not killed anyone, but had
carried them off as they went on their way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When David and his men came to the city,
they found it burned down and their wives and sons and daughters
taken captive. So David and the troops with him lifted up their
voices and wept until they had no strength left to weep. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David’s two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel
and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel, had been taken captive. And
David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him,
because the soul of every man grieved for his sons and daughters. But
David found strength in the LORD his God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David said to Abiathar the priest,
the son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Abiathar brought it to him, and David
inquired of the LORD: “Should I pursue these raiders? Will I
overtake them?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Pursue them,” the LORD replied, “for
you will surely overtake them and rescue the captives.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David and his six hundred men went to
the Brook of Besor, where some stayed behind because two hundred men
were too exhausted to cross the brook. But David and four hundred men
continued in pursuit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now his men found an Egyptian in the field
and brought him to David. They gave the man water to drink and food
to eat— a piece of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins. So he
ate and was revived, for he had not had any food or water for three
days and three nights. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David asked him, “To whom do you
belong, and where are you from?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I am an Egyptian,” he replied, “the
slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me three days ago when I
fell ill. We raided the Negev of the Cherethites, the territory of
Judah, and the Negev of Caleb, and we burned down Ziklag.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Will you lead me to these raiders?”
David asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the man replied, “Swear to me by God
that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hand of my master,
and I will lead you to them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he led David down, and there were the
Amalekites spread out over all the land, eating, drinking, and
celebrating the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land
of the Philistines and the land of Judah. And David struck them down
from twilight until the evening of the next day. Not a man escaped,
except four hundred young men who fled, riding off on camels. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David recovered everything the
Amalekites had taken, including his two wives. Nothing was missing,
young or old, son or daughter, or any of the plunder the Amalekites
had taken. David brought everything back. And he recovered all the
flocks and herds, which his men drove ahead of the other livestock,
calling out, “This is David’s plunder!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When David came to the two hundred men who
had been too exhausted to follow him from the Brook of Besor, they
came out to meet him and the troops with him. As David approached the
men, he greeted them, but all the wicked and worthless men among
those who had gone with David said, “Because they did not go with
us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered, except for
each man’s wife and children. They may take them and go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But David said, “My brothers, you must
not do this with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and
delivered into our hands the raiders who came against us. Who will
listen to your proposal? The share of the one who went to battle will
match the share of the one who stayed with the supplies. They will
share alike.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And so it has been from that day forward.
David established this statute as an ordinance for Israel to this
very day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When David arrived in Ziklag, he sent some
of the plunder to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, “Here
is a gift for you from the plunder of the LORD’s enemies.” He
sent gifts to those in Bethel, Ramoth Negev, and Jattir; to those in
Aroer, Siphmoth, and Eshtemoa; to those in Racal and in the cities of
the Jerahmeelites and Kenites; to those in Hormah, Bor-ashan, and
Athach; and to those in Hebron and in all the places where David and
his men had roamed. </font>
