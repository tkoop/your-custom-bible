<font >Jesus said to His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“It
is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the one
through whom they come! It would be better for him to have a
millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the sea than to
cause one of these little ones to stumble.</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Watch yourselves. If
your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. Even
if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times returns
to say, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.” </font></font>

servant comes in from plowing or shepherding in the field will say to
him, ‘Come at once and sit down to eat’? Instead, won’t he tell
him, ‘Prepare my meal and dress yourself to serve me while I eat
and drink; and afterward you may eat and drink’? Does he thank the
servant because he did what he was told? So you also, when you have
done everything commanded of you, should say, ‘We are unworthy
servants; we have only done our duty.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”

<font >While Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem,
He was passing between Samaria and Galilee. As He entered one of the
villages, He was met by ten lepers. They stood at a distance and
raised their voices, shouting, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”
</font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus saw them, He said, <font color="#a80000">“Go,
show yourselves to the priests.”</font> And as they were on their
way, they were cleansed. </font>

<font >When asked by the Pharisees when the
kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“The
kingdom of God will not come with observable signs. Nor will people
say, ‘Look, here it is,’ or ‘There it is.’ For you see, the
kingdom of God is in your midst.”</font> </font>

<font >Then He said to the disciples, <font color="#a80000">“The
time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son
of Man, but you will not see it. People will tell you, ‘Look, there
He is!’ or ‘Look, here He is!’ Do not go out or chase after
them. For just as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from
one end to the other, so will be the Son of Man in His day. But first
He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >It will be just like
that on the day the Son of Man is revealed. On that day, let no one
on the housetop come down to retrieve his possessions. Likewise, let
no one in the field return for anything he has left behind. Remember
Lot’s wife! Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but
whoever loses his life will preserve it. I tell you, on that night
two people will be in one bed: One will be taken and the other left.
Two women will be grinding grain together: One will be taken and the
other left.” </font></font>
