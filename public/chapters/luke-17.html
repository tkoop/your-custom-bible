<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Temptations and Trespasses<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 18:6–9; Mark 9:42–48)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Jesus said to His disciples, <span>“It is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the one through whom they come!
<span class="reftext">2</span>It would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the sea than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">3</span>Watch yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Even if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times returns to say, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Power of Faith<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 17:19–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>And the Lord answered, <span>“If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">7</span>Which of you whose servant comes in from plowing or shepherding in the field will say to him, ‘Come at once and sit down to eat’?
<span class="reftext">8</span>Instead, won’t he tell him, ‘Prepare my meal and dress yourself to serve me while I eat and drink; and afterward you may eat and drink’?
<span class="reftext">9</span>Does he thank the servant because he did what he was told?
<span class="reftext">10</span>So you also, when you have done everything commanded of you, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Ten Lepers<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 5:1–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>While Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem, He was passing between Samaria and Galilee.
<span class="reftext">12</span>As He entered one of the villages, He was met by ten lepers.<span class="fn">a</span>  They stood at a distance
<span class="reftext">13</span>and raised their voices, shouting, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When Jesus saw them, He said, <span>“Go, show yourselves to the priests.”</span><span class="fn">b</span>  And as they were on their way, they were cleansed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>When one of them saw that he was healed, he came back, praising God in a loud voice.
<span class="reftext">16</span>He fell facedown at Jesus’ feet in thanksgiving to Him—and he was a Samaritan.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">17</span>“Were not all ten cleansed?”</span> Jesus asked. <span>“Where then are the other nine?
<span class="reftext">18</span>Was no one found except this foreigner to return and give glory to God?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then Jesus said to him, <span>“Rise and go; your faith has made you well!<span class="fn">c</span>”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Coming of the Kingdom<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Genesis 19:24–29)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>When asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, <span>“The kingdom of God will not come with observable signs.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Nor will people say, ‘Look, here it is,’ or ‘There it is.’ For you see, the kingdom of God is in your midst.<span class="fn">d</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then He said to the disciples, <span>“The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
<span class="reftext">23</span>People will tell you, ‘Look, there He is!’ or ‘Look, here He is!’ Do not go out or chase after them.
<span class="reftext">24</span>For just as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other, so will be the Son of Man in His day.
<span class="reftext">25</span>But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">26</span>Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man:
<span class="reftext">27</span>People were eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>It was the same in the days of Lot: People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.
<span class="reftext">29</span>But on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">30</span>It will be just like that on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
<span class="reftext">31</span>On that day, let no one on the housetop come down to retrieve his possessions. Likewise, let no one in the field return for anything he has left behind.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Remember Lot’s wife!
<span class="reftext">33</span>Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it.
<span class="reftext">34</span>I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed: one will be taken and the other left.
<span class="reftext">35</span>Two women will be grinding grain together: one will be taken and the other left.”<span class="fn">e</span> 

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>“Where, Lord?” they asked. </p><p class="reg1"> Jesus answered, <span>“Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.”</span></p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> A <i class="calibre6">leper</i> was one afflicted with a skin disease.
