</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>When one of them saw that he was healed, he came back, praising God in a loud voice.
<span class="reftext">16</span>He fell facedown at Jesus’ feet in thanksgiving to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>—and he was a Samaritan.

<span class="reftext">21</span>Nor will people say, ‘Look, here it is,’ or ‘There it is.’ For you see, the kingdom of God is in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> midst.<span class="fn">d</span>”</span>

<span class="reftext">24</span>For just as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other, so will be the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of Man in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> day.

</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">26</span>Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of Man:

</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>It was the same in the days of Lot: People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.

</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">30</span>It will be just like that on the day the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of Man is revealed.
<span class="reftext">31</span>On that day, let no one on the housetop come down to retrieve his possessions. Likewise, let no one in the field return for anything he has left behind.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Remember Lot’s wife!
<span class="reftext">33</span>Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it.
