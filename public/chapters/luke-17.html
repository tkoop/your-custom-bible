is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the one

He is!’ or ‘Look, here He is!’ Do not go out or chase after
them. For just as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from
one end to the other, so will be the Son of Man in His day. But first
He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</font>

Lot’s wife! Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but
whoever loses his life will preserve it. I tell you, on that night
two people will be in one bed: One will be taken and the other left.
Two women will be grinding grain together: One will be taken and the
