<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the Philistines fought against Israel,
and the men of Israel fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount
Gilboa. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Philistines followed hard after Saul
and his sons, and they killed Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and
Malchishua. When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers
overtook him and wounded him. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw
your sword and run it through me, or these uncircumcised men will
come and torture me!” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was
dead, he too fell on his own sword and died. So Saul died together

that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they
abandoned their cities and ran away. So the Philistines came and
occupied their cities. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The next day, when the Philistines came to
strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
They stripped Saul, cut off his head, took his armor, and sent
messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the
news in the temple of their idols and among their people. They put
his armor in the temple of their gods and hung his head in the temple
of Dagon. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard
about everything the Philistines had done to Saul, all their men of
valor set out and retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons and
brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak in
Jabesh and fasted seven days. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Saul died for his unfaithfulness to the
LORD, because he did not keep the word of the LORD and even consulted
a medium for guidance, and he failed to inquire of the LORD. So the
LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of
Jesse. </font>
