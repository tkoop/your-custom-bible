</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>The Philistines followed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua.
<span class="reftext">3</span>When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers overtook him and wounded him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Saul said to his armour-bearer, “Draw your sword and run it through me, or these uncircumcised men will come and torture me!” </p><p class="reg1"> But his armour-bearer was terrified and refused to do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his own sword and died.
<span class="reftext">6</span>So Saul died together with his three sons and all his house.
</p><p class="hdg">The Philistines Possess the Towns<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Samuel 31:7–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their cities and ran away. So the Philistines came and occupied their cities.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
<span class="reftext">9</span>They stripped Saul, cut off his head, took his armour, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people.
<span class="reftext">10</span>They put his armour in the temple of their gods and hung his head in the temple of Dagon.

<span class="reftext">12</span>all their men of valour set out and retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. And they buried their bones under the oak<span class="fn">a</span>  in Jabesh and fasted seven days.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Saul died for his unfaithfulness to the LORD, because he did not keep the word of the LORD and even consulted a medium for guidance,
<span class="reftext">14</span>and he failed to inquire of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">terebinth</i> or <i class="calibre6">great tree</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
