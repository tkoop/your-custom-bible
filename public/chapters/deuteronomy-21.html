<span class="reftext">2</span>your elders and judges must come out and measure the distance from the victim to the neighboring cities.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then the elders of the city nearest the victim shall take a heifer that has never been yoked or used for work,
<span class="reftext">4</span>bring the heifer to a valley with running water that has not been plowed or sown, and break its neck there by the stream.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has chosen them to serve Him and pronounce blessings in His name and to give a ruling in every dispute and case of assault.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then all the elders of the city nearest the victim shall wash their hands by the stream over the heifer whose neck has been broken,
<span class="reftext">7</span>and they shall declare, “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Accept this atonement, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, for Your people Israel whom You have redeemed, and do not hold the shedding of innocent blood against them.” </p><p class="reg1"> And the bloodshed will be atoned for.
<span class="reftext">9</span>So you shall purge from among you the guilt of shedding innocent blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="hdg">Marrying a Captive Woman</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>When you go to war against your enemies and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God delivers them into your hand and you take them captive,
<span class="reftext">11</span>if you see a beautiful woman among them, and you desire her and want to take her as your wife,
<span class="reftext">12</span>then you shall bring her into your house. She must shave her head, trim her nails,
<span class="reftext">13</span>and put aside the clothing of her captivity. </p><p class="reg1"> After she has lived in your house a full month and mourned her father and mother, you may have relations with her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And if you are not pleased with her, you are to let her go wherever she wishes. But you must not sell her for money or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.
</p><p class="hdg">Inheritance Rights of the Firstborn</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>If a man has two wives, one beloved and the other unloved, and both bear him sons, but the unloved wife has the firstborn son,
<span class="reftext">16</span>when that man assigns his inheritance to his sons he must not appoint the son of the beloved wife as the firstborn over the son of the unloved wife.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Instead, he must acknowledge the firstborn, the son of his unloved wife, by giving him a double portion of all that he has. For that son is the firstfruits of his father’s strength; the right of the firstborn belongs to him.
</p><p class="hdg">A Rebellious Son<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 15:11–32)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and does not listen to them when disciplined,
<span class="reftext">19</span>his father and mother are to lay hold of him and bring him to the elders of his city, to the gate of his hometown,
<span class="reftext">20</span>and say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he does not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then all the men of his city will stone him to death. So you must purge the evil from among you,<span class="fn">a</span>  and all Israel will hear and be afraid.
