<font ><b>The Message of the Watchman</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, speak to your people and tell them: ‘Suppose
I bring the sword against a land, and the people of that land choose
a man from among them, appointing him as their watchman, and he sees
the sword coming against that land and blows the ram’s horn to warn
the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then if anyone hears the sound of the horn
but fails to heed the warning, and the sword comes and takes him
away, his blood will be on his own head. Since he heard the sound of
the horn but failed to heed the warning, his blood will be on his own
head. If he had heeded the warning, he would have saved his life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if the watchman sees the sword coming
and fails to blow the horn to warn the people, and the sword comes
and takes away a life, then that one will be taken away in his
iniquity, but I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for you, O son of man, I have made you
a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word from My mouth
and give them the warning from Me. If I say to the wicked, ‘O
wicked man, you will surely die,’ but you do not speak out to
dissuade him from his way, then that wicked man will die in his
iniquity, yet I will hold you accountable for his blood. But if you
warn the wicked man to turn from his way, and he does not turn from
it, he will die in his iniquity, but you will have saved your life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now as for you, son of man, tell the house
of Israel that this is what they have said: ‘Our transgressions and
our sins are heavy upon us, and we are wasting away because of them!
How can we live?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Say to them: ‘As surely as I live,
declares the Lord GOD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked,
but rather that the wicked should turn from their ways and live.
Turn! Turn from your evil ways! For why should you die, O house of
Israel?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, son of man, say to your people:
‘The righteousness of the righteous man will not deliver him in the
day of his transgression; neither will the wickedness of the wicked
man cause him to stumble on the day he turns from his wickedness. Nor
will the righteous man be able to survive by his righteousness on the
day he sins.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If I tell the righteous man that he will
surely live, but he then trusts in his righteousness and commits
iniquity, then none of his righteous works will be remembered; he
will die because of the iniquity he has committed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if I tell the wicked man, ‘You will
surely die,’ and he turns from his sin and does what is just and
right— if he restores a pledge, makes restitution for what he has
stolen, and walks in the statutes of life without practicing
iniquity—then he will surely live; he will not die. None of the
sins he has committed will be held against him. He has done what is
just and right; he will surely live. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet your people say, ‘The way of the
Lord is not just.’ But it is their way that is not just. If a
righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he
will die for it. But if a wicked man turns from his wickedness and
does what is just and right, he will live because of this. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not
just.’ But I will judge each of you according to his ways, O house
of Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the twelfth year of our exile, on the
fifth day of the tenth month, a fugitive from Jerusalem came to me
and reported, “The city has been taken!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the evening before the fugitive
arrived, the hand of the LORD was upon me, and He opened my mouth
before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and
I was no longer mute. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, those living in the ruins in the land of
Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the
land. But we are many; surely the land has been given to us as a
possession.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore tell them that this is what the
Lord GOD says: ‘You eat meat with the blood in it, lift up your
eyes to your idols, and shed blood. Should you then possess the land?
You have relied on your swords, you have committed detestable acts,
and each of you has defiled his neighbor’s wife. Should you then
possess the land?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Tell them that this is what the Lord GOD
says: ‘As surely as I live, those in the ruins will fall by the
sword, those in the open field I will give to be devoured by wild
animals, and those in the strongholds and caves will die by plague. I
will make the land a desolate waste, and the pride of her strength
will come to an end. The mountains of Israel will become desolate, so
that no one will pass through. Then they will know that I am the
LORD, when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the
abominations they have committed.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for you, son of man, your people are
talking about you near the city walls and in the doorways of their
houses. One speaks to another, each saying to his brother, ‘Come
and hear the message that has come from the LORD!’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So My people come to you as usual, sit
before you, and hear your words; but they do not put them into
practice. Although they express love with their mouths, their hearts
pursue dishonest gain. Indeed, you are to them like a singer of love
songs with a beautiful voice, who skillfully plays an instrument.
They hear your words but do not put them into practice. So when it
comes to pass—and surely it will come—then they will know that a
prophet has been among them.” </font>
