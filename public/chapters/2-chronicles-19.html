<font ><b>Jehoshaphat’s Reforms</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jehoshaphat king of Judah had
returned safely to his home in Jerusalem, Jehu son of Hanani the seer
went out to confront him and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you
help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this,
the wrath of the LORD is upon you. However, some good is found in
you, for you have removed the Asherah poles from the land and have
set your heart on seeking God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and once
again he went out among the people from Beersheba to the hill country
of Ephraim and turned them back to the LORD, the God of their
fathers. He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified
cities of Judah. Then he said to the judges, “Consider carefully
what you do, for you are not judging for man, but for the LORD, who
is with you when you render judgment. And now, may the fear of the
LORD be upon you. Be careful what you do, for with the LORD our God
there is no injustice or partiality or bribery.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, Jehoshaphat appointed in
Jerusalem some of the Levites, priests, and heads of the Israelite
families to judge on behalf of the LORD and to settle disputes. And
they lived in Jerusalem. He commanded them, saying, “You must serve
faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD. For every
dispute that comes before you from your brothers who dwell in their
cities—whether it regards bloodshed or some other violation of law,
commandments, statutes, or ordinances—you are to warn them, so that
they will not incur guilt before the LORD and wrath will not come
upon you and your brothers. Do this, and you will not incur guilt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Note that Amariah, the chief priest, will
be over you in all that pertains to the LORD, and Zebadiah son of
Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all that pertains to the
king. And the Levites will serve as officers before you. Act
resolutely; may the LORD be with the upright!” </font>
