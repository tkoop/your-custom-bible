<span class="reftext">2</span>Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to confront him and said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>? Because of this, the wrath of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is upon you.
<span class="reftext">3</span>However, some good is found in you, for you have removed the Asherah poles from the land and have set your heart on seeking God.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jehoshaphat’s Reforms</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and once again he went out among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of their fathers.
<span class="reftext">5</span>He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then he said to the judges, “Consider carefully what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do, for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are not judging for man, but for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, who is with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> when you render <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span>.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And now, may the fear of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> be upon <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. Be careful what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do, for with <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Moreover, Jehoshaphat appointed in Jerusalem some of the Levites, priests, and heads of the Israelite families to judge on behalf of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and to settle disputes. And they lived in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">9</span>He commanded them, saying, “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For every dispute that comes before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers who dwell in their cities—whether it regards bloodshed or some other violation of law, commandments, statutes, or ordinances—<span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are to warn them, so that they will not incur guilt before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and wrath will not come upon <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers. Do this, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will not incur guilt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Note that Amariah, the chief priest, will be over <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in all that pertains to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all that pertains to the king. And the Levites will serve as officers before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. Act resolutely; may <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> be with the upright!”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
