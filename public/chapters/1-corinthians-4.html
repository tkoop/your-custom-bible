<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Servants of Christ</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Now it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>I care very little, however, if I am judged by <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.
<span class="reftext">4</span>My conscience is clear, but that does not vindicate me. It is the Lord who judges me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men’s hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> benefit, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may learn from us not to go beyond what is written. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will not take pride in one man over another.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For who makes you so superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Already <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have all <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> want. Already <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have become rich. Without us, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have become kings. How I wish <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> really were kings, so that we might be kings with you!
<span class="reftext">9</span>For it seems to me that God has displayed us apostles at the end of the procession, like prisoners appointed for death. We have become a spectacle to the whole world, to angels as well as to men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>We are fools for Christ, but <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are wise in Christ. We are weak, but <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are strong. <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are <span class='spell ca'>honoured</span><span class='spell gb'>honoured</span><span class='spell us'>honored</span>, but we are dishonored.
<span class="reftext">11</span>To this very hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed, we are brutally treated, we are homeless.
<span class="reftext">12</span>We work hard with our own hands. When we are vilified, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;
<span class="reftext">13</span>when we are slandered, we answer gently. Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Fatherly Warning</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I am not writing this to shame <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, but to warn you as my beloved children.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Even if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have ten thousand guardians in Christ, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore I urge <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to imitate me.
<span class="reftext">17</span>That is why I have sent <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> of my way of life in Christ Jesus,<span class="fn">a</span>  which is exactly what I teach everywhere in every church.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Some of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But I will come to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> shortly, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only what these arrogant people are saying, but what power they have.
<span class="reftext">20</span>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Which do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> prefer? Shall I come to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> with a rod, or in love and with a gentle spirit?</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">my way of life in Christ,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
