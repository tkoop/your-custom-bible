servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. Now it is
required of stewards that they be found faithful. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">I care very little, however, if I am
judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge
myself. My conscience is clear, but that does not vindicate me. It is
the Lord who judges me. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore judge nothing before the
appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light
what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men’s
hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Brothers, I have applied these things to
myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us
not to go beyond what is written. Then you will not take pride in one
man over another. For who makes you so superior? What do you have
that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast
as though you did not? </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Already you have all you want. Already you
have become rich. Without us, you have become kings. How I wish you
really were kings, so that we might be kings with you! For it seems
to me that God has displayed us apostles at the end of the
procession, like prisoners appointed for death. We have become a
spectacle to the whole world, to angels as well as to men. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">We are fools for Christ, but you are wise
in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we
are dishonored. To this very hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are
poorly clothed, we are brutally treated, we are homeless. We work
hard with our own hands. When we are vilified, we bless; when we are
persecuted, we endure it; when we are slandered, we answer gently. Up
to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of
the world. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am not writing this to shame you, but to
warn you as my beloved children. Even if you have ten thousand
guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers; for in Christ
Jesus I became your father through the gospel. Therefore I urge you
to imitate me. That is why I have sent you Timothy, my beloved and
faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in
Christ Jesus, which is exactly what I teach everywhere in every
church. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Some of you have become arrogant, as if I
were not coming to you. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord
is willing, and then I will find out not only what these arrogant
people are saying, but what power they have. For the kingdom of God
is not a matter of talk but of power. Which do you prefer? Shall I
come to you with a rod, or in love and with a gentle spirit? </font>
