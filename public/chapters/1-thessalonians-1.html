God and Father your work of faith, your labor of love, and your

<font >Brothers who are beloved by God, we know
that He has chosen you, because our gospel came to you not only in
word, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit, and with great
conviction—just as you know we lived among you for your sake. And
you became imitators of us and of the Lord when you welcomed the
message with the joy of the Holy Spirit, in spite of your great
suffering. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As a result, you have become an example to
all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia. For not only did the
message of the Lord ring out from you to Macedonia and Achaia, but
your faith in God has gone out to every place, so that we have no
need to say anything more. For they themselves report what kind of
welcome you gave us, and how you turned to God from idols to serve
the living and true God and to await His Son from heaven, whom He
raised from the dead—Jesus our deliverer from the coming wrath. </font>
