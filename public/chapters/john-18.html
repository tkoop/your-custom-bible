<font ><b>The Betrayal of Jesus</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Jesus had spoken these words, He
went out with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where they
entered a garden. Now Judas His betrayer also knew the place, because
Jesus had often met there with His disciples. So Judas brought a band
of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees. They
arrived at the garden carrying lanterns, torches, and weapons. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus, knowing all that was coming upon
Him, stepped forward and asked them, <font color="#a80000">“Whom
are you seeking?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“I am
He.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Judas His betrayer was standing there
with them. When Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“I am He,”</font>
they drew back and fell to the ground. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So He asked them again, <font color="#a80000">“Whom
are you seeking?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >I told you that I
am He,”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“So if you
are looking for Me, let these men go.”</font> This was to fulfill
the word He had spoken: <font color="#a80000">“I have not lost one
of those You have given Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Simon Peter drew his sword and struck
the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. The
servant’s name was Malchus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Put your sword
back in its sheath!”</font> Jesus said to Peter. <font color="#a80000">“Shall
I not drink the cup the Father has given Me?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the band of soldiers, with its
commander and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound Him.
They brought Him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of
Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas was the one who had
advised the Jews that it would be better if one man died for the
people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Simon Peter and another disciple were
following Jesus. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he
also went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest. But Peter
stood outside at the door. Then the disciple who was known to the
high priest went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter
in. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, the servant girl watching the
door said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of this man’s
disciples?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I am not,” he answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because it was cold, the servants and
officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had made to keep
warm. And Peter was also standing with them, warming himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, the high priest questioned
Jesus about His disciples and His teaching. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >I have spoken
openly to the world,”</font> Jesus answered. <font color="#a80000">“I
always taught in the synagogues and at the temple, where all the Jews
come together. I said nothing in secret. Why are you asking Me? Ask
those who heard My message. Surely they know what I said.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus had said this, one of the
officers standing nearby slapped Him in the face and said, “Is this
how You answer the high priest?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“If
I said something wrong, testify as to what was wrong. But if I spoke
correctly, why did you strike Me?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Annas sent Him, still bound, to
Caiaphas the high priest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Simon Peter was still standing and warming
himself. So they asked him, “Aren’t you also one of His
disciples?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He denied it and said, “I am not.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One of the high priest’s servants, a
relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Didn’t I
see you with Him in the garden?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter denied it once more, and immediately
a rooster crowed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they led Jesus away from Caiaphas
into the Praetorium. By now it was early morning, and the Jews did
not enter the Praetorium, to avoid being defiled and unable to eat
the Passover. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Pilate went out to them and asked,
“What accusation are you bringing against this man?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >If He were not a criminal,” they
replied, “we would not have handed Him over to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >You take Him and judge Him by your own
law,” Pilate told them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >We are not permitted to execute
anyone,” the Jews replied. This was to fulfill the word that Jesus
had spoken to indicate the kind of death He was going to die. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Pilate went back into the Praetorium,
summoned Jesus, and asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Are you saying
this on your own,”</font> Jesus asked, <font color="#a80000">“or
did others tell you about Me?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Am I a Jew?” Pilate replied. “Your
own people and chief priests handed You over to me. What have You
done?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“My
kingdom is not of this world; if it were, My servants would fight to
prevent My arrest by the Jews. But now My kingdom is not of this
realm.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Then You are a king!” Pilate said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >You say that I am
a king,”</font> Jesus answered. <font color="#a80000">“For this
reason I was born and have come into the world, to testify to the
truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to My voice.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What is truth?” Pilate asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And having said this, he went out again to
the Jews and told them, “I find no basis for a charge against Him.
But it is your custom that I release to you one prisoner at the
Passover. So then, do you want me to release to you the King of the
Jews?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Not this man,” they shouted, “but
Barabbas!” (Now Barabbas was an insurrectionist.) </font>
