<font ><b>Temple Construction Begins</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Solomon began to build the house of
the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to
his father David. This was the place that David had prepared on the
threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. Solomon began construction on
the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The foundation that Solomon laid for the
house of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide, according
to the old standard. The portico at the front, extending across the
width of the temple, was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits high.
He overlaid the inside with pure gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He paneled the main room with cypress,
which he overlaid with fine gold and decorated with palm trees and
chains. He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty, and
its gold was from Parvaim. He overlaid its beams, thresholds, walls,
and doors with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he made the Most Holy Place; its
length corresponded to the width of the templeâ€”twenty cubits long
and twenty cubits wide. And he overlaid the inside with six hundred
talents of fine gold. The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of
gold. He also overlaid the upper area with gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the Most Holy Place he made two
cherubim of sculptured work, and he overlaid them with gold. The
total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the
first cherub was five cubits long and touched the wall of the temple,
and its other wing was five cubits long and touched the wing of the
other cherub. The wing of the second cherub also measured five cubits
and touched the wall of the temple, while its other wing measured
five cubits and touched the wing of the first cherub. So the total
wingspan of these cherubim was twenty cubits. They stood on their
feet, facing the main room. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He made the veil of blue, purple, and
crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim woven into it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In front of the temple he made two
pillars, which together were thirty-five cubits high, each with a
capital on top measuring five cubits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He made interwoven chains and put them on
top of the pillars. He made a hundred pomegranates and fastened them
into the chainwork. Then he set up the pillars in front of the
temple, one on the south and one on the north. The pillar on the
south he named Jachin, and the pillar on the north he named Boaz. </font>
