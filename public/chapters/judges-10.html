<span class="reftext">4</span>He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys. And they had thirty towns in the land of Gilead, which to this day are called Havvoth-jair.<span class="fn">b</span>

They served the Baals, the Ashtoreths, the gods of Aram, Sidon, and Moab, and the gods of the Ammonites and Philistines. Thus they forsook <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and did not serve <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>So the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against Israel, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> sold them into the hands of the Philistines and Ammonites,
<span class="reftext">8</span>who that very year harassed and oppressed the Israelites, and did so for eighteen years to all the Israelites on the other side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, and Israel was in deep distress.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then the Israelites cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, saying, “We have sinned against <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>, for we have indeed forsaken our God and served the Baals.”

<span class="reftext">14</span>Go and cry out to the gods <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have chosen. Let them save <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in your time of trouble.”
