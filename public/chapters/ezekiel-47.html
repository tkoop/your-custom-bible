<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Waters from under the Temple</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the man brought me back to the entrance of the temple, and I saw water flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Next he brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and there I saw the water trickling out from the south side.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits<span class="fn">a</span>  and led me through ankle-deep water.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then he measured off a thousand cubits and led me through knee-deep water. </p><p class="reg1"> Again he measured a thousand cubits and led me through waist-deep water.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Once again he measured off a thousand cubits, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough for swimming—a river that could not be crossed on foot.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>“Son of man, do you see this?” he asked. Then he led me back to the bank of the river.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>When I arrived, I saw a great number of trees along both banks of the river.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he said to me, “This water flows out to the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah. When it empties into the Sea,<span class="fn">b</span>  the water there becomes fresh.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Wherever the river flows, there will be swarms of living creatures and a great number of fish, because it flows there and makes the waters fresh; so wherever the river flows, everything will flourish.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Fishermen will stand by the shore; from En-gedi to En-eglaim they will spread their nets to catch fish of many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Along both banks of the river, fruit trees of all kinds will grow. Their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. Each month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will be used for food and their leaves for healing.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Borders of the Land</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: “These are the boundaries by which you are to divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph shall receive two portions.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">14</span>You are to divide it equally among them. Because I swore with an uplifted hand to give it to your forefathers, this land will fall to you as an inheritance.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>This shall be the boundary of the land: </p><p class="list1stline"> On the north side it will extend from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon through Lebo-hamath to Zedad,
<span class="reftext">16</span>Berothah, and Sibraim<span class="fn">f</span>  (which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.
<span class="reftext">17</span>So the border will run from the Sea to Hazar-enan, along the northern border of Damascus, with the territory of Hamath to the north. This will be the northern boundary.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>On the east side the border will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the Eastern Sea and as far as Tamar.<span class="fn">g</span>  This will be the eastern boundary.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>On the south side it will run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, and along the Brook of Egypt<span class="fn">h</span>  to the Great Sea. This will be the southern boundary.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>And on the west side, the Great Sea will be the boundary up to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This will be the western boundary.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>You are to divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
<span class="reftext">22</span>You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners who dwell among you and who have children. You are to treat them as native-born Israelites; along with you, they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
<span class="reftext">23</span>In whatever tribe a foreigner dwells, you are to assign his inheritance there,” declares the Lord GOD.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">1,000 (long) cubits</i> is approximately 1,750 feet or 533.4 meters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, the Dead Sea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">is healed</i>; also in verses 9 and 11<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> That is, the Mediterranean Sea; also in verses 15, 19, and 20<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Since Levi had no portion, Joseph’s sons Ephraim and Manasseh received land as two tribes.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> LXX; MT <i class="calibre6"><span class="fnv">15</span>...through Lebo to Zedad, <span class="fnv">16</span>Hamath, Berothah, and Sibraim</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> See Syriac; that is, <i class="calibre6">of Israel, to the Dead Sea and as far as Tamar</i>; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">of Israel.
