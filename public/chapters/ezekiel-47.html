<font ><b>Waters from under the Temple</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the man brought me back to the
entrance of the temple, and I saw water flowing from under the
threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east).
The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple,
south of the altar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next he brought me out through the north
gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and
there I saw the water trickling out from the south side. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the man went eastward with a measuring
line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits and led me
through ankle-deep water. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he measured off a thousand cubits and
led me through knee-deep water. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again he measured a thousand cubits and
led me through waist-deep water. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once again he measured off a thousand
cubits, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the
water had risen and was deep enough for swimming—a river that could
not be crossed on foot. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Son of man, do you see this?” he
asked. Then he led me back to the bank of the river. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When I arrived, I saw a great number of
trees along both banks of the river. And he said to me, “This water
flows out to the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah. When
it empties into the Sea, the water there becomes fresh. Wherever the
river flows, there will be swarms of living creatures and a great
number of fish, because it flows there and makes the waters fresh; so
wherever the river flows, everything will flourish. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Fishermen will stand by the shore; from
En-gedi to En-eglaim they will spread their nets to catch fish of
many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the swamps and marshes will not become
fresh; they will be left for salt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Along both banks of the river, fruit trees
of all kinds will grow. Their leaves will not wither, and their fruit
will not fail. Each month they will bear fruit, because the water
from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will be used for food
and their leaves for healing.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the Lord GOD says: “These
are the boundaries by which you are to divide the land as an
inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel; Joseph shall receive
two portions. You are to divide it equally among them. Because I
swore with an uplifted hand to give it to your forefathers, this land
will fall to you as an inheritance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This shall be the boundary of the land: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.4cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >On the north side it will extend from the
Great Sea by way of Hethlon through Lebo-hamath to Zedad, Berothah,
and Sibraim (which is on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as
far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. So the
border will run from the Sea to Hazar-enan, along the northern border
of Damascus, with the territory of Hamath to the north. This will be
the northern boundary. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >On the east side the border will run
between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the
land of Israel, to the Eastern Sea and as far as Tamar. This will be
the eastern boundary. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >On the south side it will run from Tamar
to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, and along the Brook of Egypt to the
Great Sea. This will be the southern boundary. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >And on the west side, the Great Sea will
be the boundary up to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This will be the
western boundary. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are to divide this land among
yourselves according to the tribes of Israel. You shall allot it as
an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners who dwell among
you and who have children. You are to treat them as native-born
Israelites; along with you, they shall be allotted an inheritance
among the tribes of Israel. In whatever tribe a foreigner dwells, you
are to assign his inheritance there,” declares the Lord GOD. </font>
