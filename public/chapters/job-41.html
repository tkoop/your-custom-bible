</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Can you put a cord through his nose </p><p class="indent"> or pierce his jaw with a hook?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Will he beg you for mercy </p><p class="indent"> or speak to you softly?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Will he make a covenant with you </p><p class="indent"> to take him as a slave for life?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Can you pet him like a bird </p><p class="indent"> or put him on a <span class='spell ca'>leash</span><span class='spell gb'>lead</span><span class='spell us'>leash</span> for your maidens?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Will traders barter for him </p><p class="indent"> or divide him among the merchants?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Can you fill his hide with harpoons </p><p class="indent"> or his head with fishing spears?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>If you lay a hand on him, </p><p class="indent"> you will remember the battle and never repeat it!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Surely hope of overcoming him is false. </p><p class="indent"> Is not the sight of him overwhelming?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>No one is so fierce as to rouse Leviathan. </p><p class="indent"> Then who is able to stand against Me?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Who has given to Me that I should repay him?<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> Everything under heaven is Mine.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>I cannot keep silent about his limbs, </p><p class="indent"> his power and graceful form.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Who can strip off his outer coat? </p><p class="indent"> Who can approach him with a bridle?<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Who can open his jaws, </p><p class="indent"> ringed by his fearsome teeth?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>His rows of scales are his pride, </p><p class="indent"> tightly sealed together.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>One scale is so near to another </p><p class="indent"> that no air can pass between them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>They are joined to one another; </p><p class="indent"> they clasp and cannot be separated.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>His snorting flashes with light, </p><p class="indent"> and his eyes are like the rays of dawn.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Firebrands stream from his mouth; </p><p class="indent"> fiery sparks shoot forth!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Smoke billows from his nostrils </p><p class="indent"> as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>His breath sets coals ablaze, </p><p class="indent"> and flames pour from his mouth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Strength resides in his neck, </p><p class="indent"> and dismay leaps before him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; </p><p class="indent"> they are firm and immovable.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>His chest is as hard as a rock, </p><p class="indent"> as hard as a lower millstone!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>When Leviathan rises up, the mighty are terrified; </p><p class="indent"> they withdraw before his thrashing.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>The sword that reaches him has no effect, </p><p class="indent"> nor does the spear or dart or arrow.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>He regards iron as straw </p><p class="indent"> and bronze as rotten wood.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>No arrow can make him flee; </p><p class="indent"> slingstones become like chaff to him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>A club is regarded as straw, </p><p class="indent"> and he laughs at the sound of the lance.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>His undersides are jagged potsherds, </p><p class="indent"> spreading out the mud like a threshing sledge.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; </p><p class="indent"> he makes the sea like a jar of ointment.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>He leaves a glistening wake behind him; </p><p class="indent"> one would think the deep had white hair!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Nothing on earth is his equal—</p><p class="indent"> a creature devoid of fear!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">34</span>He looks down on all the haughty; </p><p class="indent"> he is king over all the proud.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in Romans 11:35<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Who can come within his double <span class='spell ca'>mail</span><span class='spell gb'>post</span><span class='spell us'>mail</span>?</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">29</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">javelin</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
