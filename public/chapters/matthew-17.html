<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Transfiguration<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 9:1–13; Luke 9:28–36; 2 Peter 1:16–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After six days Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
<span class="reftext">2</span>There He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared before them, talking with Jesus.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If You wish, I will put up three shelters<span class="fn">a</span>—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>While Peter was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<span class="fn">b</span>  Listen to Him!”
<span class="reftext">6</span>When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown in terror.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then Jesus came over and touched them. <span>“Get up,”</span> He said. <span>“Do not be afraid.”</span>
<span class="reftext">8</span>And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, <span>“Do not tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>The disciples asked Him, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Elijah does indeed come, and he will restore all things.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not <span class='spell ca'>recognize</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognize</span> him, but have done to him whatever they wished. In the same way, the Son of Man will suffer at their hands.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then the disciples understood that He was speaking to them about John the Baptist.
</p><p class="hdg">The Boy with a Demon<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 9:14–29; Luke 9:37–42)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When they came to the crowd, a man came up to Jesus and knelt before Him.
<span class="reftext">15</span>“Lord, have mercy on my son,” he said. “He has seizures and is suffering terribly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
<span class="reftext">16</span>I brought him to Your disciples, but they could not heal him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">17</span>“O unbelieving and perverse generation!”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“How long must I remain with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to Me.”</span>
<span class="reftext">18</span>Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed from that moment.
</p><p class="hdg">The Power of Faith<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 17:5–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Afterward the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">20</span>“Because you have so little faith,”</span> He answered. <span>“For truly I tell you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”</span><span class="fn">c</span> 

</p><p class="hdg">The Second Prediction of the Passion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 9:30–32; Luke 9:43–45)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>When they gathered together in Galilee, Jesus told them, <span>“The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.
<span class="reftext">23</span>They will kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised to life.”</span> And the disciples were deeply grieved.
</p><p class="hdg">The Temple Tax</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>After they had arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax<span class="fn">d</span>  came to Peter and asked, “Does your Teacher pay the two drachmas?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>“Yes,” he answered. </p><p class="reg1"> When Peter entered the house, Jesus preempted him. <span>“What do you think, Simon?”</span> He asked. <span>“From whom do the kings of the earth collect customs and taxes: from their own sons, or from others?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>“From others,” Peter answered. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“Then the sons are exempt,”</span> Jesus declared.
<span><span class="reftext">27</span>“But so that we may not offend them, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take the first fish you catch. When you open its mouth, you will find a four-drachma coin.<span class="fn">e</span>  Take it and give it to them for My tax and yours.”</span></p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">three tabernacles</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Cited in 2 Peter 1:17<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6"><span class="fnv">21</span>But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting</i>; see Mark 9:29.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">the didrachma</i>; twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">a stater</i>; that is, a silver coin worth approximately one shekel<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
