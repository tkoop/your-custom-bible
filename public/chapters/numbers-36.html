<span class="reftext">2</span>saying, “When the LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, He also commanded him to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But if they marry any of the men from the other tribes of Israel, their inheritance will be withdrawn from the portion of our fathers and added to the tribe into which they marry. So our allotted inheritance would be taken away.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And when the Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to the tribe into which they marry and taken away from the tribe of our fathers.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So at the word of the LORD, Moses commanded the Israelites: “The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks correctly.
<span class="reftext">6</span>This is what the LORD has commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad: They may marry anyone they please, provided they marry within a clan of the tribe of their father.
<span class="reftext">7</span>No inheritance in Israel may be transferred from tribe to tribe, because each of the Israelites is to retain the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Every daughter who possesses an inheritance from any Israelite tribe must marry within a clan of the tribe of her father, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers.
<span class="reftext">9</span>No inheritance may be transferred from one tribe to another, for each tribe of Israel must retain its inheritance.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So the daughters of Zelophehad did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to cousins on their father’s side.
<span class="reftext">12</span>They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained within the tribe of their father’s clan.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>These are the commandments and ordinances that the LORD gave the Israelites through Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
