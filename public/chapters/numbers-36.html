<font ><b>Zelophehad’s Daughters Marry</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the family heads of the clan of Gilead
son of Machir son of Manasseh, one of the clans of Joseph, approached
Moses and the leaders who were the heads of the Israelite families
and addressed them, saying, “When the LORD commanded my lord to
give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, He also
commanded him to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to
his daughters. But if they marry any of the men from the other tribes
of Israel, their inheritance will be withdrawn from the portion of
our fathers and added to the tribe into which they marry. So our
allotted inheritance would be taken away. And when the Jubilee for
the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to the tribe
into which they marry and taken away from the tribe of our fathers.”

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So at the word of the LORD, Moses
commanded the Israelites: “The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks
correctly. This is what the LORD has commanded concerning the
daughters of Zelophehad: They may marry anyone they please, provided
they marry within a clan of the tribe of their father. No inheritance
in Israel may be transferred from tribe to tribe, because each of the
Israelites is to retain the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
Every daughter who possesses an inheritance from any Israelite tribe
must marry within a clan of the tribe of her father, so that every
Israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers. No inheritance
may be transferred from one tribe to another, for each tribe of
Israel must retain its inheritance.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the daughters of Zelophehad did as the
LORD had commanded Moses. Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah,
the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to cousins on their
father’s side. They married within the clans of the descendants of
Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained within the
tribe of their father’s clan. </font>

<font >These are the commandments and ordinances
that the LORD gave the Israelites through Moses on the plains of Moab
by the Jordan across from Jericho. </font>
