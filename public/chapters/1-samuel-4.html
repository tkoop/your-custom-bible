<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font ><b>The Philistines Capture the Ark</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus the word of Samuel came to all
Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Israelites went out to meet the
Philistines in battle and camped at Ebenezer, while the Philistines
camped at Aphek. The Philistines arrayed themselves against Israel,
and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who
struck down about four thousand men on the battlefield. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the troops returned to the camp, the
elders of Israel asked, “Why has the LORD brought defeat on us
before the Philistines today? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of
the LORD from Shiloh, so that it may go with us to save us from the
hand of our enemies.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they
brought back the ark of the covenant of the LORD of Hosts, who sits
enthroned between the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the ark of the covenant of the LORD
entered the camp, all the Israelites raised such a great shout that
it shook the ground. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On hearing the noise of the shout, the
Philistines asked, “What is this loud shouting in the camp of the
Hebrews?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when they realized that the ark of the
LORD had entered the camp, the Philistines were afraid. “The gods
have entered their camp!” they said. “Woe to us, for nothing like
this has happened before. Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the
hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the
Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. Take courage
and be men, O Philistines! Otherwise, you will serve the Hebrews just
as they served you. Now be men and fight!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the Philistines fought, and Israel was
defeated, and each man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very
great—thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell. The ark of God
was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That same day a Benjamite ran from the
battle line all the way to Shiloh, with his clothes torn and dirt on
his head. When he arrived, there was Eli, sitting on his chair beside
the road and watching, because his heart trembled for the ark of God.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the man entered the city to give a
report, the whole city cried out. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Eli heard the outcry and asked, “Why
this commotion?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the man hurried over and reported to
Eli. Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his gaze was fixed
because he could not see. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I have just come from the battle,”
the man said to Eli. “I fled from there today.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What happened, my son?” Eli asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The messenger answered, “Israel has fled
before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among
the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are both dead, and
the ark of God has been captured.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As soon as the ark of God was mentioned,
Eli fell backward from his chair by the city gate, and being old and
heavy, he broke his neck and died. And Eli had judged Israel forty
years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of
Phinehas, was pregnant and about to give birth. When she heard the
news of the capture of God’s ark and the deaths of her
father-in-law and her husband, she collapsed and gave birth, for her
labor pains overtook her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As she was dying, the women attending to
her said, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But she did not respond or pay any heed.
And she named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from
Israel,” because the ark of God had been captured and her
father-in-law and her husband had been killed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >The glory has departed from Israel,”
she said, “for the ark of God has been captured.” </font>
