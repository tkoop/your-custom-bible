<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Philistines Capture the Ark</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Thus the word of Samuel came to all Israel. </p><p class="reg1"> Now the Israelites went out to meet the Philistines in battle and camped at Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped at Aphek.
<span class="reftext">2</span>The Philistines arrayed themselves against Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who struck down about four thousand men on the battlefield.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>When the troops returned to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why has <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> brought defeat on us before the Philistines today? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> from Shiloh, so that it may go<span class="fn">a</span>  with us to save us from the hand of our enemies.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, who sits enthroned between the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> entered the camp, all the Israelites raised such a great shout that it shook the ground.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>On hearing the noise of the shout, the Philistines asked, “What is this loud shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?” </p><p class="reg1"> And when they <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had entered the camp,
<span class="reftext">7</span>the Philistines were afraid. “The gods have entered<span class="fn">b</span>  their camp!” they said. “Woe to us, for nothing like this has happened before.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Take courage and be men, O Philistines! Otherwise, you will serve the Hebrews just as they served you. Now be men and fight!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great—thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell.
<span class="reftext">11</span>The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
</p><p class="hdg">The Death of Eli</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line all the way to Shiloh, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head.
<span class="reftext">13</span>When he arrived, there was Eli, sitting on his chair beside the road and watching, because his heart trembled for the ark of God. </p><p class="reg1"> When the man entered the city to give a report, the whole city cried out.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Eli heard the outcry and asked, “Why this commotion?” </p><p class="reg1"> So the man hurried over and reported to Eli.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his gaze was fixed because he could not see.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>“I have just come from the battle,” the man said to Eli. “I fled from there today.” </p><p class="reg1">“What happened, my son?” Eli asked.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>The messenger answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are both dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>As soon as the ark of God was mentioned, Eli fell backward from his chair by the city gate, and being old and heavy, he broke his neck and died. And Eli had judged<span class="fn">c</span>  Israel forty years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Now Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and about to give birth. When she heard the news of the capture of God’s ark and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband, she collapsed and gave birth, for her <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> pains overtook her.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>As she was dying, the women attending to her said, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son!” </p><p class="reg1"> But she did not respond or pay any heed.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And she named the boy Ichabod,<span class="fn">d</span>  saying, “The glory has departed<span class="fn">e</span>  from Israel,” because the ark of God had been captured and her father-in-law and her husband had been killed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>“The glory has departed from Israel,” she said, “for the ark of God has been captured.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">He may go</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">A god has entered</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">governed</i> or <i class="calibre6">led</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Ichabod</i> means <i class="calibre6">no glory</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">gone into exile</i>; also in verse 22<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
