<font ><b>The Axe Head Floats</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the sons of the prophets said to
Elisha, “Please take note that the place where we meet with you is
too small for us. Please let us go to the Jordan, where each of us
can get a log so we can build ourselves a place to live there.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Go,” said Elisha. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then one of them said, “Please come with
your servants.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I will come,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Elisha went with them, and when they
came to the Jordan, they began to cut down some trees. As one of them
was cutting down a tree, the iron axe head fell into the water. “Oh,
my master,” he cried out, “it was borrowed!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Where did it fall?” asked the man of
God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when he showed him the place, the man
of God cut a stick, threw it there, and made the iron float. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Lift it out,” he said, and the man
reached out his hand and took it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the king of Aram was at war against
Israel. After consulting with his servants, he said, “My camp will
be in such and such a place.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the man of God sent word to the king
of Israel: “Be careful passing by this place, for the Arameans are
going down there.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king of Israel sent word to the
place the man of God had pointed out. Time and again Elisha warned
the king, so that he was on his guard in such places. For this reason
the king of Aram became enraged and called his servants to demand of
them, “Tell me, which one of us is on the side of the king of
Israel?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But one of his servants replied, “No
one, my lord the king. For Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the
king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king said, “Go and see where he
is, that I may send men to capture him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On receiving the report, “Elisha is in
Dothan,” the king of Aram sent horses, chariots, and a great army.
They went there by night and surrounded the city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the servant of the man of God got up
and went out early in the morning, an army with horses and chariots
had surrounded the city. So he asked Elisha, “Oh, my master, what
are we to do?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Do not be afraid,” Elisha answered,
“for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Elisha prayed, “O LORD, please open
his eyes that he may see.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD opened the eyes of the young
man, and he saw that the hills were full of horses and chariots of
fire all around Elisha. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the Arameans came down against him,
Elisha prayed to the LORD, “Please strike these people with
blindness.” So He struck them with blindness, according to the word
of Elisha. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Elisha told them, “This is not the
way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will take you to the
man you are seeking.” And he led them to Samaria. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they had entered Samaria, Elisha
said, “O LORD, open the eyes of these men that they may see.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD opened their eyes, and they
looked around and discovered that they were in Samaria. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when the king of Israel saw them, he
asked Elisha, “My father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Do not kill them,” he replied. “Would
you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food
and water before them, that they may eat and drink and then return to
their master.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king prepared a great feast for
them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them
away, and they returned to their master. And the Aramean raiders did
not come into the land of Israel again. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some time later, Ben-hadad king of Aram
assembled his entire army and marched up to besiege Samaria. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So there was a great famine in Samaria.
Indeed, they besieged the city so long that a donkey’s head sold
for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter cab of dove’s dung sold
for five shekels of silver. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the king of Israel was passing by on
the wall, a woman cried out to him, “Help me, my lord the king!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He answered, “If the LORD does not help
you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or the
winepress?” Then the king asked her, “What is the matter?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And she answered, “This woman said to
me, ‘Give up your son, that we may eat him, and tomorrow we will
eat my son.’ So we boiled my son and ate him, and the next day I
said to her, ‘Give up your son, that we may eat him.’ But she had
hidden her son.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the king heard the words of the
woman, he tore his clothes. And as he passed by on the wall, the
people saw the sackcloth under his clothes next to his skin. He
announced, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if the head of
Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders through this day!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and
the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead,
but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, “Do you see how
this murderer has sent someone to cut off my head? Look, when the
messenger comes, shut the door to keep him out. Is not the sound of
his master’s footsteps behind him?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Elisha was still speaking with them,
the messenger came down to him. And the king said, “This calamity
is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?” </font>
