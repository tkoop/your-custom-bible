<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Defiling of Dinah</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land.
<span class="reftext">2</span>When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw her, he took her and lay with her by force.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And his soul was drawn to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob. He loved the young girl and spoke to her tenderly.
<span class="reftext">4</span>So Shechem told his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as a wife.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah, but since his sons were with his livestock in the field, he remained silent about it until they returned.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Meanwhile, Shechem’s father Hamor came to speak with Jacob.
<span class="reftext">7</span>When Jacob’s sons heard what had happened, they returned from the field. They were filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had committed an outrage in Israel<span class="fn">a</span>  by lying with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not be done.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Intermarry with us; give us your daughters, and take our daughters for yourselves.
<span class="reftext">10</span>You may settle among us, and the land will be open to you. Live here, move about freely, and acquire your own property.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Grant me this favor, and I will give you whatever you ask.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Demand a high dowry and an expensive gift, and I will give you whatever you ask. Only give me the girl as my wife!”
</p><p class="hdg">The Revenge of Dinah’s Brothers</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But because Shechem had defiled their sister Dinah, Jacob’s sons answered him and his father Hamor deceitfully.
<span class="reftext">14</span>“We cannot do such a thing,” they said. “To give our sister to an uncircumcised man would be a disgrace to us.
<span class="reftext">15</span>We will consent to this on one condition, that you become circumcised like us—every one of your males.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We will dwell among you and become one people.
<span class="reftext">17</span>But if you will not agree to be circumcised, then we will take our sister and go.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Their offer seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.
<span class="reftext">19</span>The young man, who was the most respected of all his father’s household, did not hesitate to fulfill this request, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city and addressed the men of their city:
<span class="reftext">21</span>“These men are at peace with us. Let them live and trade in our land; indeed, it is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage and give our daughters to them.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But only on this condition will the men agree to dwell with us and be one people: if all our men are circumcised as they are.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Will not their livestock, their possessions, and all their animals become ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell among us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>All the men who went out of the city gate listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male of the city was circumcised.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Three days later, while they were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons (Dinah’s brothers Simeon and Levi) took their swords, went into the unsuspecting city, and slaughtered every male.
<span class="reftext">26</span>They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords, took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Jacob’s other sons came upon the slaughter and looted the city, because their sister had been defiled.
<span class="reftext">28</span>They took their flocks and herds and donkeys, and everything else in the city or in the field.
<span class="reftext">29</span>They carried off all their possessions and women and children, and they plundered everything in their houses.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble upon me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people of this land. We are few in number; if they unite against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">against Israel</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
