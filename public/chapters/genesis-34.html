<font ><b>The Revenge of Dinah’s Brothers</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to
Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land. When Shechem son
of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the region, saw her, he took her
and lay with her by force. And his soul was drawn to Dinah, the
daughter of Jacob. He loved the young girl and spoke to her tenderly.
So Shechem told his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as a wife.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his
daughter Dinah, but since his sons were with his livestock in the
field, he remained silent about it until they returned. Meanwhile,
Shechem’s father Hamor came to speak with Jacob. When Jacob’s
sons heard what had happened, they returned from the field. They were
filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had committed an outrage
in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not
be done. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem
longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.
Intermarry with us; give us your daughters, and take our daughters
for yourselves. You may settle among us, and the land will be open to
you. Live here, move about freely, and acquire your own property.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and
brothers, “Grant me this favor, and I will give you whatever you
ask. Demand a high dowry and an expensive gift, and I will give you
whatever you ask. Only give me the girl as my wife!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But because Shechem had defiled their
sister Dinah, Jacob’s sons answered him and his father Hamor
deceitfully. “We cannot do such a thing,” they said. “To give
our sister to an uncircumcised man would be a disgrace to us. We will
consent to this on one condition, that you become circumcised like
us—every one of your males. Then we will give you our daughters and
take your daughters for ourselves. We will dwell among you and become
one people. But if you will not agree to be circumcised, then we will
take our sister and go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Their offer seemed good to Hamor and his
son Shechem. The young man, who was the most respected of all his
father’s household, did not hesitate to fulfill this request,
because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the
gate of their city and addressed the men of their city: “These men
are at peace with us. Let them live and trade in our land; indeed, it
is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters in marriage and
give our daughters to them. But only on this condition will the men
agree to dwell with us and be one people: if all our men are
circumcised as they are. Will not their livestock, their possessions,
and all their animals become ours? Only let us consent to them, and
they will dwell among us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All the men who went out of the city gate
listened to Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male of the city was
circumcised. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Three days later, while they were still in
pain, two of Jacob’s sons (Dinah’s brothers Simeon and Levi) took
their swords, went into the unsuspecting city, and slaughtered every
male. They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords, took
Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jacob’s other sons came upon the
slaughter and looted the city, because their sister had been defiled.
They took their flocks and herds and donkeys, and everything else in
the city or in the field. They carried off all their possessions and
women and children, and they plundered everything in their houses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You
have brought trouble upon me by making me a stench to the Canaanites
and Perizzites, the people of this land. We are few in number; if
they unite against me and attack me, I and my household will be
destroyed.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But they replied, “Should he have
treated our sister like a prostitute?” </font>
