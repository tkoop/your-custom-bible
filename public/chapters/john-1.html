<span class="reftext">2</span>He was with God in the beginning.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made.
<span class="reftext">4</span>In Him was life, and that life was the light of men.
<span class="reftext">5</span>The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome<span class="fn">a</span>  it.
</p><p class="hdg">The Witness of John</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>There came a man who was sent from God. His name was John.
<span class="reftext">7</span>He came as a witness to testify about the Light, so that through him everyone might believe.
<span class="reftext">8</span>He himself was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The true Light who gives light to every man was coming into the world.
<span class="reftext">10</span>He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him.
<span class="reftext">11</span>He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But to all who did receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God—
<span class="reftext">13</span>children born not of blood, nor of the desire or will of man, but born of God.
</p><p class="hdg">The Word Became Flesh<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 84:1–12)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.<span class="fn">b</span>  We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son<span class="fn">c</span>  from the Father, full of grace and truth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>John testified concerning Him. He cried out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>From His fullness we have all received grace upon grace.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext">18</span>No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is Himself God and<span class="fn">d</span>  is at the Father’s side,<span class="fn">e</span>  has made Him known.
</p><p class="hdg">The Mission of John the Baptist<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 40:1–5; Matthew 3:1–12; Mark 1:1–8; Luke 3:1–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And this was John’s testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?”
<span class="reftext">20</span>He did not refuse to confess, but openly declared, “I am not the Christ.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>“Then who are you?” they inquired. “Are you Elijah?” </p><p class="reg1"> He said, “I am not.” </p><p class="reg1">“Are you the Prophet?” </p><p class="reg1"> He answered, “No.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So they said to him, “Who are you? We need an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I am a voice of one calling in the wilderness, </p><p class="indent">‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then the Pharisees who had been sent
<span class="reftext">25</span>asked him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>“I baptize with<span class="fn">g</span>  water,” John replied, “but among you stands One you do not know.
<span class="reftext">27</span>He is the One who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>All this happened at Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus the Lamb of God<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 3:13–17; Mark 1:9–11; Luke 3:21–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
<span class="reftext">30</span>This is He of whom I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because He was before me.’
<span class="reftext">31</span>I myself did not know Him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that He might be revealed to Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and resting on Him.
<span class="reftext">33</span>I myself did not know Him, but the One who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is He who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’
<span class="reftext">34</span>I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.<span class="fn">h</span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The First Disciples<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 4:18–22; Mark 1:16–20; Luke 5:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.
<span class="reftext">36</span>When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”
<span class="reftext">37</span>And when the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>Jesus turned and saw them following. <span>“What do you want?”</span> He asked. </p><p class="reg1"> They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are You staying?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">39</span>“Come and see,”</span> He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and spent that day with Him. It was about the tenth hour.<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard John’s testimony and followed Jesus.
<span class="reftext">41</span>He first found his brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated as Christ).
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>Andrew brought him to Jesus, who looked at him and said, <span>“You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas”</span> (which is translated as Peter).
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>The next day Jesus decided to set out for Galilee. Finding Philip, He told him, <span>“Follow Me.”</span>
<span class="reftext">44</span>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law, the One the prophets foretold—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>“Can anything good come from Nazareth?” Nathanael asked. </p><p class="reg1">“Come and see,” said Philip.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, He said of him, <span>“Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>“How do You know me?” Nathanael asked. </p><p class="reg1"> Jesus replied, <span>“Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">49</span>“Rabbi,” Nathanael answered, “You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>Jesus said to him, <span>“Do you believe just because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than these.”</span>
<span class="reftext">51</span>Then He declared, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, you will all see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”</span><span class="fn">j</span> </p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">comprehended</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">and tabernacled among us</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Only Begotten</i> or <i class="calibre6">the Unique One</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">but the only begotten God, who</i>; BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">but the only begotten Son, who</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">in the Father’s bosom</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Isaiah 40:3 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in</i>; also in verse 31 and twice in 33<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">34</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> SBL <i class="calibre6">the Chosen One of God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">39</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> That is, about four in the afternoon<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">51</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> See Genesis 28:12.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
