1</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font ><b>The Word Became Flesh</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the
beginning. Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing
was made that has been made. In Him was life, and that life was the
light of men. The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has
not overcome it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There came a man who was sent from God.
His name was John. He came as a witness to testify about the Light,
so that through him everyone might believe. He himself was not the
Light, but he came to testify about the Light. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The true Light who gives light to every
man was coming into the world. He was in the world, and though the
world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him. He came
to His own, and His own did not receive Him. But to all who did
receive Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to
become children of God— children born not of blood, nor of the
desire or will of man, but born of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Word became flesh and made His
dwelling among us. We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and
only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >John testified concerning Him. He cried
out, saying, “This is He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me
has surpassed me because He was before me.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From His fullness we have all received
grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and
truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God, but the
one and only Son, who is Himself God and is at the Father’s side,
has made Him known. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And this was John’s testimony when the
Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are
you?” He did not refuse to confess, but openly declared, “I am
not the Christ.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Then who are you?” they inquired.
“Are you Elijah?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He said, “I am not.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Are you the Prophet?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He answered, “No.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they said to him, “Who are you? We
need an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about
yourself?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >John replied in the words of Isaiah the
prophet: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >I am a voice of one calling in the
wilderness, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Make straight the way for the Lord.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Pharisees who had been sent asked
him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor
Elijah, nor the Prophet?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I baptize with water,” John replied,
“but among you stands One you do not know. He is the One who comes
after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All this happened at Bethany beyond the
Jordan, where John was baptizing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day John saw Jesus coming toward
him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the
world! This is He of whom I said, ‘A man who comes after me has
surpassed me because He was before me.’ I myself did not know Him,
but the reason I came baptizing with water was that He might be
revealed to Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit
descending from heaven like a dove and resting on Him. I myself did
not know Him, but the One who sent me to baptize with water told me,
‘The man on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is He who will
baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ I have seen and testified that this
is the Son of God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day John was there again with two
of his disciples. When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, “Look, the
Lamb of God!” And when the two disciples heard him say this, they
followed Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus turned and saw them following. <font color="#a80000">“What
do you want?”</font> He asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They said to Him, “Rabbi” (which means
Teacher), “where are You staying?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Come and see,”</font>
He replied. So they went and saw where He was staying, and spent that
day with Him. It was about the tenth hour. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one
of the two who heard John’s testimony and followed Jesus. He first
found his brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah”
(which is translated as Christ). </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Andrew brought him to Jesus, who looked at
him and said, <font color="#a80000">“You are Simon son of John. You
will be called Cephas”</font> (which is translated as Peter). </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day Jesus decided to set out for
Galilee. Finding Philip, He told him, <font color="#a80000">“Follow
Me.”</font> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew
and Peter. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We
have found the One Moses wrote about in the Law, the One the prophets
foretold—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Can anything good come from Nazareth?”
Nathanael asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Come and see,” said Philip. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, He
said of him, <font color="#a80000">“Here is a true Israelite, in
whom there is no deceit.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >How do You know me?” Nathanael asked.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Before
Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Rabbi,” Nathanael answered, “You
are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus said to him, <font color="#a80000">“Do
you believe just because I told you I saw you under the fig tree? You
will see greater things than these.”</font> Then He declared,
<font color="#a80000">“Truly, truly, I tell you, you will all see
heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son
of Man.”</font> </font>
