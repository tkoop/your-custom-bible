<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Assurance of Victory</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Hear, O Israel: Today you are about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities fortified to the heavens.
<span class="reftext">2</span>The people are strong and tall, the descendants of the Anakim. You know about them, and you have heard it said, “Who can stand up to the sons of Anak?”
<span class="reftext">3</span>But understand that today <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God goes across ahead of you as a consuming fire; He will destroy them and subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them swiftly, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has promised you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has driven them out before you, do not say in your heart, “Because of my righteousness <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has brought me in to possess this land.” Rather, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is driving out these nations before you because of their wickedness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>It is not because of your righteousness or uprightness of heart that you are going in to possess their land, but it is because of their wickedness that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is driving out these nations before you, to keep the promise He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.
</p><p class="hdg">The Golden Calf<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 32:1–35; Acts 7:39–43)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Remember this, and never forget how you provoked <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God in the wilderness. From the day you left the land of Egypt until you reached this place, you have been rebelling against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>At Horeb<span class="fn">a</span>  you provoked <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and He was angry enough to destroy you.
<span class="reftext">9</span>When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I ate no bread and drank no water.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gave me the two stone tablets, inscribed by the finger of God with the exact words that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> spoke to you out of the fire on the mountain on the day of the assembly.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And at the end of forty days and forty nights, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me, “Get up and go down from here at once, for your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have corrupted themselves. How quickly they have turned aside from the way that I commanded them! They have made for themselves a molten image.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> also said to me, “I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Leave Me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. Then I will make you into a nation mightier and greater than they are.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So I went back down the mountain while it was blazing with fire, with the two tablets of the covenant in my hands.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And I saw how you had sinned against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God; you had made for yourselves a molten calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded you.
<span class="reftext">17</span>So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, shattering them before your eyes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then I fell down before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> for forty days and forty nights, as I had done the first time. I did not eat bread or drink water because of all the sin you had committed in doing what was evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and provoking Him to anger.
<span class="reftext">19</span>For I was afraid<span class="fn">b</span>  of the anger and wrath that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had directed against you, enough to destroy you. But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> listened to me this time as well.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I also prayed for Aaron.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And I took that sinful thing, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust, and I cast it into the stream that came down from the mountain.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>You continued to provoke <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> at Taberah,<span class="fn">c</span>  at Massah,<span class="fn">d</span>  and at Kibroth-hattaavah.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And when <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> sent you out from Kadesh-barnea, He said, “Go up and possess the land that I have given you.” </p><p class="reg1"> But you rebelled against the command of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God. You neither believed Him nor obeyed Him.
<span class="reftext">24</span>You have been rebelling against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> since the day I came to know you.
<span class="reftext">25</span>So I fell down before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> for forty days and forty nights, because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had said He would destroy you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>And I prayed to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and said, “O Lord GOD, do not destroy Your people, Your inheritance, whom You redeemed through Your greatness and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people and the wickedness of their sin.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Otherwise, those in the land from which You brought us out will say, ‘Because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was not able to bring them into the land He had promised them, and because He hated them, He has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’
<span class="reftext">29</span>But they are Your people, Your inheritance, whom You brought out by Your great power and outstretched arm.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, Mount Sinai, or possibly a mountain in the range containing Mount Sinai<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">And I am greatly terrified</i>; cited in Hebrews 12:21<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Taberah</i> means <i class="calibre6">burning</i>; see Numbers 11:3.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Massah</i> means <i class="calibre6">testing</i>; see Exodus 17:7.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Kibroth-hattaavah</i> means <i class="calibre6">graves of craving</i>; see Numbers 11:34.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
