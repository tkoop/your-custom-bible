<span class="reftext">9</span>He had begun the journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, for the gracious hand of his God was upon him.

</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>Artaxerxes, king of kings. </p><p class="tab1stline"> To Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven: </p><p class="tab1stline"> Greetings.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>I hereby decree that any volunteers among the Israelites in my kingdom, including the priests and Levites, may go up with you to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">14</span>You are sent by the king and his seven counselors to evaluate Judah and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God, which is in your hand.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
<span class="reftext">16</span>together with all the silver and gold you may find in all the province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests to the house of their God in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">17</span>With this money, therefore, you are to buy as many bulls, rams, and lambs as needed, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and offer them on the altar at the house of your God in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">18</span>You and your brothers may do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold, according to the will of your God.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>You must deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles given to you for the service of the house of your God.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And if anything else is needed for the house of your God that you may have occasion to supply, you may pay for it from the royal treasury.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>I, King Artaxerxes, decree to all the treasurers west of the Euphrates:<span class="fn">e</span>  Whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, may require of you, it must be provided promptly,

<span class="reftext">23</span>Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven must be done diligently for His house. For why should wrath fall on the realm of the king and his sons?
<span class="reftext">24</span>And be advised that you have no authority to impose tribute, duty, or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, temple servants, or other servants of this house of God.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which you possess, are to appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people west of the Euphrates—all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach these laws to anyone who does not know them.
<span class="reftext">26</span>If anyone does not keep the law of your God and the law of the king, let a strict <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> be executed against him, whether death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.
