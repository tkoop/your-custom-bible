<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Message to Ahaz</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now in the days that Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, Rezin king of Aram<span class="fn">a</span>  marched up to wage war against Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Pekah son of Remaliah the king of Israel, but he could not overpower the city.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>When it was reported to the house of David that Aram was in league with Ephraim,<span class="fn">b</span>  the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled like trees in the forest shaken by the wind.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear-jashub<span class="fn">c</span>  to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct that feeds the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field,
<span class="reftext">4</span>and say to him: Calm down and be quiet. Do not be afraid or disheartened over these two smoldering stubs of firewood—over the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted your ruin, saying:
<span class="reftext">6</span>‘Let us invade Judah, terrorize it, and divide it<span class="fn">d</span>  among ourselves. Then we can install the son of Tabeal over it as king.’
<span class="reftext">7</span>But this is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘It will not arise; </p><p class="indent"> it will not happen.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>For the head of Aram is Damascus, </p><p class="indent"> and the head of Damascus is Rezin. </p><p class="indent1"> Within sixty-five years </p><p class="indent"> Ephraim will be shattered as a people.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, </p><p class="indent"> and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. </p><p class="indent1"> If you do not stand firm in your faith, </p><p class="indent"> then you will not stand at all.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Sign of Immanuel<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 1:18–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying,
<span class="reftext">11</span>“Ask for a sign from the LORD your God, whether from the depths of Sheol or the heights of heaven.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But Ahaz replied, “I will not ask; I will not test the LORD.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, O house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God as well?
<span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin<span class="fn">e</span>  will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call Him Immanuel.<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span>By the time He knows enough to reject evil and choose good, He will be eating curds and honey.
<span class="reftext">16</span>For before the boy knows enough to reject evil and choose good, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.
</p><p class="hdg">Judgment to Come<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Micah 1:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since the day Ephraim separated from Judah—He will bring the king of Assyria.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>On that day the LORD will whistle to the flies at the farthest streams of the Nile and to the bees in the land of Assyria.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And they will all come and settle </p><p class="indent"> in the steep ravines and clefts of the rocks, </p><p class="indent"> in all the thornbushes and watering holes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>On that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates<span class="fn">g</span>—the king of Assyria—to shave your head and the hair of your legs, and to remove your beard as well.
<span class="reftext">21</span>On that day a man will raise a young cow and two sheep,
<span class="reftext">22</span>and from the abundance of milk they give, he will eat curds; for all who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>And on that day, in every place that had a thousand vines worth a thousand shekels of silver,<span class="fn">h</span>  only briers and thorns will be found.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Men will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns.
<span class="reftext">25</span>For fear of the briers and thorns, you will no longer traverse the hills once tilled by the hoe; they will become places for oxen to graze and sheep to trample.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, Syria<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">had set up camp in Ephraim</i>, that is, the northern kingdom of Israel<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Shear-jashub</i> means <i class="calibre6">a remnant shall return</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">split it open</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">young woman</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">Immanuel</i> means <i class="calibre6">God with us</i>; literally <i class="calibre6">and she will call His name Immanuel</i>; DSS <i class="calibre6">and His name will be called Immanuel</i> or <i class="calibre6">and he will call His name Immanuel</i>; LXX <i class="calibre6">you will call His name Immanuel</i>; cited in Matthew 1:23.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the River</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">a thousand of silver</i>; that is, approximately 25.1 pounds or 11.4 kilograms of silver<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
