<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Uzziah Reigns in Judah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who
was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father
Amaziah. Uzziah was the one who rebuilt Eloth and restored it to
Judah after King Amaziah rested with his fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Uzziah was sixteen years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His
mother’s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem. And he did what
was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had
done. He sought God throughout the days of Zechariah, who instructed
him in the fear of God. And as long as he sought the LORD, God gave
him success. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Uzziah went out to wage war against the
Philistines, and he tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod.
Then he built cities near Ashdod and among the Philistines. God
helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabs living in
Gur-baal, and against the Meunites. The Ammonites brought tribute to
Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, for he had
become exceedingly powerful. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the
Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and the angle in the wall, and he
fortified them. Since he had much livestock in the foothills and in
the plain, he built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns. And
since he was a lover of the soil, he had farmers and vinedressers in
the hill country and in the fertile fields. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Uzziah had an army ready for battle that
went out to war by assigned divisions, as recorded by Jeiel the
scribe and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one
of the royal officers. The total number of family leaders of the
mighty men of valor was 2,600. Under their authority was an army of
307,500 trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against
his enemies. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Uzziah supplied the entire army with
shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and slingstones. And in
Jerusalem he made skillfully designed devices to shoot arrows and
catapult large stones from the towers and corners. So his fame spread
far and wide, for he was helped tremendously so that he became
powerful. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when Uzziah grew powerful, his
arrogance led to his own destruction. He was unfaithful to the LORD
his God, for he entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the
altar of incense. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Azariah the priest, along with eighty
brave priests of the LORD, went in after him. They took their stand
against King Uzziah and said, “Uzziah, you have no right to offer
incense to the LORD. Only the priests, the descendants of Aaron, are
consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have acted
unfaithfully; you will not receive honor from the LORD God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Uzziah, with a censer in his hand to offer
incense, was enraged. But while he raged against the priests in their
presence in the house of the LORD before the altar of incense,
leprosy broke out on his forehead. When Azariah the chief priest and
all the priests turned to him and saw his leprous forehead, they
rushed him out. Indeed, he himself hurried to get out, because the
LORD had afflicted him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So King Uzziah was a leper until the day
of his death. He lived in isolation, leprous and cut off from the
house of the LORD, while his son Jotham had charge of the royal
palace to govern the people of the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As for the rest of the acts of Uzziah,
from beginning to end, they are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of
Amoz. And Uzziah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in
a field of burial that belonged to the kings; for the people said,
“He was a leper.” And his son Jotham reigned in his place. </font>
