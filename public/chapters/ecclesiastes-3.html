</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>a time to be born and a time to die, </p><p class="indent"> a time to plant and a time to uproot,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>a time to kill and a time to heal, </p><p class="indent"> a time to break down and a time to build,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>a time to weep and a time to laugh, </p><p class="indent"> a time to mourn and a time to dance,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together, </p><p class="indent"> a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>a time to search and a time to count as lost, </p><p class="indent"> a time to keep and a time to discard,

</p><p class="hdg">God’s Works Remain Forever</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>What does the worker gain from his toil?
<span class="reftext">10</span>I have seen the burden that God has laid upon the sons of men to occupy them.
<span class="reftext">11</span>He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men, yet they cannot fathom the work that God has done from beginning to end.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and do good while they live,
<span class="reftext">13</span>and also that every man should eat and drink and find satisfaction in all his <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>—this is the gift of God.
<span class="reftext">14</span>I know that everything God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it or taken from it. God does it so that they should fear Him.
<span class="reftext">15</span>What exists has already been, and what will be has already been, for God will call to account what has passed.
</p><p class="hdg">From Dust to Dust</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Furthermore, I saw under the sun that in the place of <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> there is wickedness, and in the place of righteousness there is wickedness.
<span class="reftext">17</span>I said in my heart, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked, since there is a time for every activity and every deed.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>I said to myself, “As for the sons of men, God tests them so that they may see for themselves that they are but beasts.”
<span class="reftext">19</span>For the fates of both men and beasts are the same: As one dies, so dies the other—they all have the same breath.<span class="fn">a</span>  Man has no advantage over the animals, since everything is futile.
<span class="reftext">20</span>All go to one place; all come from dust, and all return to dust.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and the spirit of the animal descends into the earth?
<span class="reftext">22</span>I have seen that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will come after him?</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">spirit</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
