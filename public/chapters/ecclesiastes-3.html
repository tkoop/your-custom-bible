<font >What does the worker gain from his toil? I
have seen the burden that God has laid upon the sons of men to occupy
them. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set
eternity in the hearts of men, yet they cannot fathom the work that
God has done from beginning to end. </font>

them than to rejoice and do good while they live, and also that every
man should eat and drink and find satisfaction in all his labor—this
is the gift of God. I know that everything God does endures forever;
nothing can be added to it or taken from it. God does it so that they
should fear Him. What exists has already been, and what will be has
already been, for God will call to account what has passed. </font>

<font >Furthermore, I saw under the sun that in
the place of judgment there is wickedness, and in the place of
righteousness there is wickedness. I said in my heart, “God will
judge the righteous and the wicked, since there is a time for every
activity and every deed.” </font>

<font >I said to myself, “As for the sons of
men, God tests them so that they may see for themselves that they are
but beasts.” For the fates of both men and beasts are the same: As
one dies, so dies the other—they all have the same breath. Man has
no advantage over the animals, since everything is futile. All go to
one place; all come from dust, and all return to dust. </font>

upward and the spirit of the animal descends into the earth? I have
seen that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work,
because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will come
after him? </font>
