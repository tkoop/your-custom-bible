<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David reviewed his troops and
appointed over them commanders of hundreds and of thousands. He sent
out the troops, a third under Joab, a third under Joab’s brother
Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. And the
king said to the troops, “I will surely march out with you as
well.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the people pleaded, “You must not go
out! For if we have to flee, they will pay no attention to us. Even
if half of us die, they will not care; but you are worth ten thousand
of us. It is better for now if you support us from the city.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will do whatever seems best to you,”
the king replied. So he stood beside the gate, while all the troops
marched out by hundreds and by thousands. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the king had commanded Joab, Abishai,
and Ittai, “Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.” And
all the people heard the king’s orders to each of the commanders
regarding Absalom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David’s army marched into the field
to engage Israel in the battle, which took place in the forest of
Ephraim. There the people of Israel were defeated by David’s
servants, and the slaughter was great that day—twenty thousand men.
The battle spread over the whole countryside, and that day the forest
devoured more people than the sword. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Absalom was riding on his mule when he
met the servants of David, and as the mule went under the thick
branches of a large oak, Absalom’s head was caught fast in the
tree. The mule under him kept going, so that he was suspended in
midair. When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, “I just saw
Absalom hanging in an oak tree!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You just saw him!” Joab exclaimed.
“Why did you not strike him to the ground right there? I would have
given you ten shekels of silver and a warrior’s belt!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The man replied, “Even if a thousand
shekels of silver were weighed out into my hands, I would not raise
my hand against the son of the king. For we heard the king command
you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my
sake.’ If I had jeopardized my own life—and nothing is hidden
from the king—you would have abandoned me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Joab declared, “I am not going to
wait like this with you!” And he took three spears in his hand and
thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in
the oak tree. And ten young men who carried Joab’s armor surrounded
Absalom, struck him, and killed him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Joab blew the ram’s horn, and the
troops broke off their pursuit of Israel because Joab had restrained
them. They took Absalom, cast him into a large pit in the forest, and
piled a huge mound of stones over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites
fled, each to his home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">During his lifetime, Absalom had set up
for himself a pillar in the King’s Valley, for he had said, “I
have no son to preserve the memory of my name.” So he gave the
pillar his name, and to this day it is called Absalom’s Monument. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, “Please
let me run and tell the king the good news that the LORD has avenged
him of his enemies.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Joab replied, “You are not the man
to take good news today. You may do it another day, but you must not
do so today, because the king’s son is dead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Joab said to a Cushite, “Go, tell the
king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed to Joab and took off
running. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ahimaaz son of Zadok, however, persisted
and said to Joab, “Regardless of whatever may happen, please let me
also run behind the Cushite!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">My son,” Joab replied, “why do you
want to run, since you will not receive a reward?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">No matter what, I want to run!” he
replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then run!” Joab told him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and
outran the Cushite. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now David was sitting between the two
gates when the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the
wall, looked out, and saw a man running alone. So he called out and
told the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">If he is alone,” the king replied,
“he bears good news.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As the first runner drew near, the
watchman saw another man running, and he called out to the
gatekeeper, “Look! Another man is running alone!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">This one also brings good news,” said
the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The watchman said, “The first man
appears to me to be running like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is a good man,” said the king.
“He comes with good news.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All
is well!” And he bowed facedown before the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He continued, “Blessed be the LORD your
God! He has delivered up the men who raised their hands against my
lord the king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king asked, “Is the young man
Absalom all right?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Ahimaaz replied, “When Joab sent the
king’s servant and your servant, I saw a great tumult, but I do not
know what it was.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Move aside,” said the king, “and
stand here.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So he stepped aside. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Just then the Cushite came and said, “May
my lord the king hear the good news: Today the LORD has avenged you
of all who rose up against you!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king asked the Cushite, “Is the

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the Cushite replied, “May what has
become of the young man happen to the enemies of my lord the king and
to all who rise up against you to harm you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king was shaken and went up to the
gate chamber and wept. And as he walked, he cried out, “O my son
Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, O
Absalom, my son, my son!” </font>
