<span class="reftext">2</span>“Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Tell the Ammonites to hear the word of the Lord GOD, for this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you exclaimed, “Aha!” when My sanctuary was profaned, when the land of Israel was laid waste, and when the house of Judah went into exile,
<span class="reftext">4</span>therefore I will indeed give you as a possession to the people of the East. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you. They will eat your fruit and drink your milk.
<span class="reftext">5</span>I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels, and Ammon<span class="fn">a</span>  a resting place for sheep. Then you will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you clapped your hands and stomped your feet and rejoiced over the land of Israel with a heart full of contempt,
<span class="reftext">7</span>therefore I will indeed stretch out My hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and exterminate you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.’

<span class="reftext">9</span>therefore I will indeed expose the flank of Moab beginning with its frontier cities—Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim—the glory of the land.
<span class="reftext">10</span>I will give it along with the Ammonites as a possession to the people of the East, so that the Ammonites will no longer be remembered among the nations.
<span class="reftext">11</span>So I will execute <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span> on Moab, and they will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.’

<span class="reftext">13</span>therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I will stretch out My hand against Edom and cut off from it both man and beast. I will make it a wasteland, and from Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword.
<span class="reftext">14</span>I will take My vengeance on Edom by the hand of My people Israel, and they will deal with Edom according to My anger and wrath. Then they will know My vengeance, declares the Lord GOD.’
