<font >Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and
prophesy against them. Tell the Ammonites to hear the word of the
Lord GOD, for this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you
exclaimed, “Aha!” when My sanctuary was profaned, when the land
of Israel was laid waste, and when the house of Judah went into
exile, therefore I will indeed give you as a possession to the people
of the East. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among
you. They will eat your fruit and drink your milk. I will make Rabbah
a pasture for camels, and Ammon a resting place for sheep. Then you
will know that I am the LORD.’ </font>

<font >For this is what the Lord GOD says:
‘Because you clapped your hands and stomped your feet and rejoiced
over the land of Israel with a heart full of contempt, therefore I
will indeed stretch out My hand against you and give you as plunder
to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and exterminate
you from the countries. I will destroy you, and you will know that I
am the LORD.’ </font>

<font >This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because
Moab and Seir said, “Look, the house of Judah is like all the other
nations,” therefore I will indeed expose the flank of Moab
beginning with its frontier cities—Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and
Kiriathaim—the glory of the land. I will give it along with the
Ammonites as a possession to the people of the East, so that the
Ammonites will no longer be remembered among the nations. So I will
execute judgments on Moab, and they will know that I am the LORD.’ </font>

<font >This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because
Edom acted vengefully against the house of Judah, and in so doing
incurred grievous guilt, therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I
will stretch out My hand against Edom and cut off from it both man
and beast. I will make it a wasteland, and from Teman to Dedan they
will fall by the sword. I will take My vengeance on Edom by the hand
of My people Israel, and they will deal with Edom according to My
anger and wrath. Then they will know My vengeance, declares the Lord
GOD.’ </font>

the Philistines acted in vengeance, taking vengeance with malice of
soul to destroy Judah with ancient hostility, therefore this is what
the Lord GOD says: Behold, I will stretch out My hand against the
Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethites and destroy the
remnant along the coast. I will execute great vengeance against them
with furious reproof. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I
lay My vengeance upon them.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
