<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Decree of the Assembly</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came out, and the congregation assembled as one man before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> at Mizpah.
<span class="reftext">2</span>The leaders of all the people and all the tribes of Israel presented themselves in the assembly of God’s people: 400,000 men on foot, armed with swords.
<span class="reftext">3</span>(Meanwhile the Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) And the Israelites asked, “Tell us, how did this wicked thing happen?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered: “I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And during the night, the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house. They intended to kill me, but they abused my concubine, and she died.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then I took my concubine, cut her into pieces, and sent her throughout the land of Israel’s inheritance, because they had committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Behold, all <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> Israelites, give <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> advice and verdict here and now.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then all the people stood as one man and said, “Not one of us will return to his tent or to his house.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Now this is what we will do to Gibeah: We will go against it as the lot dictates.
<span class="reftext">10</span>We will take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to supply provisions for the army when they go to Gibeah<span class="fn">a</span>  in Benjamin to punish them for the atrocity they have committed in Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So all the men of Israel gathered as one man, united against the city.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And the tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that has occurred among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>?
<span class="reftext">13</span>Hand over the wicked men of Gibeah so we can put them to death and purge Israel of this evil.” </p><p class="reg1"> But the Benjamites refused to heed the voice of their fellow Israelites.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And from their cities they came together at Gibeah to go out and fight against the Israelites.
<span class="reftext">15</span>On that day the Benjamites <span class='spell ca'>mobilized</span><span class='spell gb'>mobilised</span><span class='spell us'>mobilized</span> 26,000 swordsmen from their cities, in addition to the 700 select men of Gibeah.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Among all these soldiers there were 700 select left-handers, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair without missing.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>The Israelites, apart from Benjamin, <span class='spell ca'>mobilized</span><span class='spell gb'>mobilised</span><span class='spell us'>mobilized</span> 400,000 swordsmen, each one an experienced warrior.
</p><p class="hdg">Civil War against Benjamin</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>The Israelites set out, went up to Bethel, and inquired of God, “Who of us shall go up first to fight against the Benjamites?” </p><p class="reg1">“Judah will be first,” <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>The next morning the Israelites set out and camped near Gibeah.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin and took up their battle positions at Gibeah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>And the Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down 22,000 Israelites on the battlefield that day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But the Israelite army took courage and again took their battle positions in the same place where they had arrayed themselves on the first day.
<span class="reftext">23</span>They went up and wept before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> until evening, inquiring of <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Should we again draw near for battle against our brothers the Benjamites?” </p><p class="reg1"> And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> answered, “Go up against them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>On the second day the Israelites advanced against the Benjamites.
<span class="reftext">25</span>That same day the Benjamites came out against them from Gibeah and cut down another 18,000 Israelites, all of them armed with swords.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then the Israelites, all the people, went up to Bethel, where they sat weeping before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. That day they fasted until evening and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">27</span>And the Israelites inquired of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there,
<span class="reftext">28</span>and Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, served before it.) The Israelites asked, “Should we again go out to battle against our brothers the Benjamites, or should we stop?” </p><p class="reg1"> <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> answered, “Fight, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>So Israel set up an ambush around Gibeah.
<span class="reftext">30</span>On the third day the Israelites went up against the Benjamites and arrayed themselves against Gibeah as they had done before.
<span class="reftext">31</span>The Benjamites came out against them and were drawn away from the city. They began to attack the people as before, killing about thirty men of Israel in the fields and on the roads, one of which led up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>“We are defeating them as before,” said the Benjamites. </p><p class="reg1"> But the Israelites said, “Let us retreat and draw them away from the city onto the roads.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>So all the men of Israel got up from their places and arrayed themselves at Baal-tamar, and the Israelites in ambush charged from their positions west of Gibeah.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Then 10,000 select men from all Israel made a frontal assault against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce. But the Benjamites did not <span class='spell ca'>realize</span><span class='spell gb'>realise</span><span class='spell us'>realize</span> that disaster was upon them.
<span class="reftext">35</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> defeated Benjamin in the presence of Israel, and on that day the Israelites slaughtered 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Then the Benjamites <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> they had been defeated. </p><p class="reg1"> Now the men of Israel had retreated before Benjamin because they were relying on the ambush they had set against Gibeah.
<span class="reftext">37</span>The men in ambush rushed suddenly against Gibeah; they advanced and put the whole city to the sword.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>The men of Israel had arranged a signal with the men in ambush: When they sent up a great cloud of smoke from the city,
<span class="reftext">39</span>the men of Israel would turn in the battle. </p><p class="reg1"> When the Benjamites had begun to strike them down, killing about thirty men of Israel, they said, “They are defeated before us as in the first battle.”
<span class="reftext">40</span>But when the column of smoke began to go up from the city, the Benjamites looked behind them and saw the whole city going up in smoke.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>Then the men of Israel turned back on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified when they <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that disaster had come upon them.
<span class="reftext">42</span>So they fled before the men of Israel toward the wilderness, but the battle overtook them, and the men coming out of the cities struck them down there.
<span class="reftext">43</span>They surrounded the Benjamites, pursued them, and easily overtook them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.
<span class="reftext">44</span>And 18,000 Benjamites fell, all men of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>Then the Benjamites turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and Israel cut down 5,000 men on the roads. And they overtook them at Gidom and struck down 2,000 more.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>That day 25,000 Benjamite swordsmen fell, all men of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span>.
<span class="reftext">47</span>But 600 men turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months.
<span class="reftext">48</span>And the men of Israel turned back against the other Benjamites and put to the sword all the cities, including the animals and everything else they found. And they burned down all the cities in their path.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> One Hebrew manuscript; most Hebrew manuscripts <i class="calibre6">Geba</i>, a variant of <i class="calibre6">Gibeah</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Some LXX manuscripts and Vulgate; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">charged from their positions in Maareh-geba</i> or <i class="calibre6">charged from their positions into the open space of Geba</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
