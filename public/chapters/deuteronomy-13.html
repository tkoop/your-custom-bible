<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If a prophet or dreamer of dreams arises
among you and proclaims a sign or wonder to you, and if the sign or
wonder he has spoken to you comes about, but he says, “Let us
follow other gods (which you have not known) and let us worship
them,” you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer.
For the LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love Him
with all your heart and with all your soul. You are to follow the
LORD your God and fear Him. Keep His commandments and listen to His
voice; serve Him and hold fast to Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Such a prophet or dreamer must be put to
death, because he has advocated rebellion against the LORD your God,
who brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the
house of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way in which the
LORD your God has commanded you to walk. So you must purge the evil
from among you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If your very own brother, or your son or
daughter, or the wife you embrace, or your closest friend secretly
entices you, saying, “Let us go and worship other gods” (which
neither you nor your fathers have known, the gods of the peoples
around you, whether near or far, whether from one end of the earth or
the other), you must not yield to him or listen to him. Show him no
pity, and do not spare him or shield him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Instead, you must surely kill him. Your
hand must be the first against him to put him to death, and then the
hands of all the people. Stone him to death for trying to turn you
away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of slavery. Then all Israel will hear and be
afraid, and will never again do such a wicked thing among you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If, regarding one of the cities the LORD
your God is giving you to inhabit, you hear it said that wicked men
have arisen from among you and have led the people of their city
astray, saying, “Let us go and serve other gods” (which you have
not known), then you must inquire, investigate, and interrogate
thoroughly. And if it is established with certainty that this
abomination has been committed among you, you must surely put the
inhabitants of that city to the sword. Devote to destruction all its
people and livestock. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And you are to gather all its plunder in
the middle of the public square, and completely burn the city and all
its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. The city
must remain a mound of ruins forever, never to be rebuilt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nothing devoted to destruction shall cling
to your hands, so that the LORD will turn from His fierce anger,
grant you mercy, show you compassion, and multiply you as He swore to
your fathers, because you obey the LORD your God, keeping all His
commandments I am giving you today and doing what is right in the
eyes of the LORD your God. </font>
