<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Jesus and the Samaritan Woman</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jesus realized that the Pharisees
were aware He was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John
(although it was not Jesus who baptized, but His disciples), He left
Judea and returned to Galilee. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now He had to pass through Samaria. So He
came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that
Jacob had given to his son Joseph. Since Jacob’s well was there,
Jesus, weary from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the
sixth hour. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When a Samaritan woman came to draw water,
Jesus said to her, <font color="#a80000">“Give Me a drink.”</font>
(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You are a Jew,” said the woman. “How
can You ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do
not associate with Samaritans.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“If
you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would
have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Sir,” the woman replied, “You have
nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where then will You get
this living water? Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us
this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his
livestock?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus said to her, <font color="#a80000">“Everyone
who drinks this water will be thirsty again. But whoever drinks the
water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will
become in him a fount of water springing up to eternal life.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me
this water so that I will not get thirsty and have to keep coming
here to draw water.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus told her, <font color="#a80000">“Go,
call your husband and come back.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I have no husband,” the woman
replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus said to her, <font color="#a80000">“You
are correct to say that you have no husband. In fact, you have had
five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. You have
spoken truthfully.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Sir,” the woman said, “I see that
You are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you
Jews say that the place where one must worship is in Jerusalem.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Believe Me,
woman,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“a time is
coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor
in Jerusalem. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do
know, for salvation is from the Jews. But a time is coming and has
now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit
and in truth, for the Father is seeking such as these to worship Him.
God is Spirit, and His worshipers must worship Him in spirit and in
truth.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The woman said, “I know that Messiah”
(called Christ) “is coming. When He comes, He will explain
everything to us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“I
who speak to you am He.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Just then His disciples returned and were
surprised that He was speaking with a woman. But no one asked Him,
“What do You want from her?” or “Why are You talking with her?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the woman left her water jar, went
back into the town, and said to the people, “Come, see a man who
told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?” So they
left the town and made their way toward Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile the disciples urged Him, “Rabbi,
eat something.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But He told them, <font color="#a80000">“I
have food to eat that you know nothing about.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the disciples asked one another, “Could
someone have brought Him food?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus explained, <font color="#a80000">“My
food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work. Do
you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest’? I
tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are ripe
for harvest.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Already the reaper
draws his wages and gathers a crop for eternal life, so that the
sower and the reaper may rejoice together. For in this case the
saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true. I sent you to reap
what you have not worked for; others have done the hard work, and now
you have taken up their labor.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Many of the Samaritans from that town
believed in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me
everything I ever did.” So when the Samaritans came to Him, they
asked Him to stay with them, and He stayed two days. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And many more believed because of His
message. They said to the woman, “We now believe not only because
of your words; we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man
truly is the Savior of the world.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After two days, Jesus left for Galilee.
Now He Himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own
hometown. Yet when He arrived, the Galileans welcomed Him. They had
seen all the great things He had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for
they had gone there as well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So once again He came to Cana in Galilee,
where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a royal
official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. When he heard that Jesus
had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Him to come down
and heal his son, who was about to die. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus said to him, <font color="#a80000">“Unless
you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Sir,” the official said, “come down
before my child dies.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go,”</font>
said Jesus. <font color="#a80000">“Your son will live.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The man took Jesus at His word and
departed. And while he was still on the way, his servants met him
with the news that his boy was alive. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So he inquired as to the hour when his son
had recovered, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at
the seventh hour.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the father realized that this was the
very hour in which Jesus had told him, <font color="#a80000">“Your
son will live.”</font> And he and all his household believed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This was now the second sign that Jesus
performed after coming from Judea into Galilee. </font>
