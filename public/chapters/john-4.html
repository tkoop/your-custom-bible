<span class="reftext">2</span>(although it was not Jesus who baptized, but <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples),
<span class="reftext">3</span><span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> left Judea and returned to Galilee.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had to pass through Samaria.
<span class="reftext">5</span>So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Since Jacob’s well was there, Jesus, weary from <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, <span>“Give <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> a drink.”</span>
<span class="reftext">8</span>(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“You are a Jew,” said the woman. “How can <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Jesus answered, <span>“If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> would have given you living water.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>“Sir,” the woman replied, “You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where then will <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> get this living water?
<span class="reftext">12</span>Are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Jesus said to her, <span>“Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a fount of water springing up to eternal life.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The woman said to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Jesus told her, <span>“Go, call your husband and come back.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>“I have no husband,” the woman replied. </p><p class="reg1"> Jesus said to her, <span>“You are correct to say that you have no husband.
<span class="reftext">18</span>In fact, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. You have spoken truthfully.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>“Sir,” the woman said, “I see that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> are a prophet.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where one must worship is in Jerusalem.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">21</span>“Believe <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, woman,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“a time is coming when you will worship the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">22</span>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.
<span class="reftext">23</span>But a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> in spirit and in truth, for the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> is seeking such as these to worship <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">24</span>God is <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> worshipers must worship <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in spirit and in truth.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>The woman said, “I know that <span class='cap'>Messiah</span><span class='nocap'>messiah</span>” (called Christ) “is coming. When <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> comes, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will explain everything to us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Jesus answered, <span>“I who speak to you am <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Disciples Return and Marvel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Just then <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples returned and were surprised that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was speaking with a woman. But no one asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “What do <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> want from her?” or “Why are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> talking with her?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then the woman left her water jar, went back into the town, and said to the people,
<span class="reftext">29</span>“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?”
<span class="reftext">30</span>So they left the town and made their way toward Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Meanwhile the disciples urged <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Rabbi, eat something.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>But <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> told them, <span>“I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>So the disciples asked one another, “Could someone have brought <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> food?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus explained, <span>“My food is to do the will of <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> who sent <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and to finish <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> work.
<span class="reftext">35</span>Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest’? I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are ripe<span class="fn">d</span>  for harvest.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">36</span>Already the reaper draws his wages and gathers a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.
<span class="reftext">37</span>For in this case the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true.
<span class="reftext">38</span>I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the hard work, and now you have taken up their <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>.”
</p><p class="hdg">Many Samaritans Believe</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.”
<span class="reftext">40</span>So when the Samaritans came to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, they asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> to stay with them, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> stayed two days.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>And many more believed because of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> message.
<span class="reftext">42</span>They said to the woman, “We now believe not only because of your words; we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man truly is the <span class='cap'>Savior</span><span class='nocap'>savior</span> of the world.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals the Official’s Son<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 8:5–13; Luke 7:1–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>After two days, Jesus left for Galilee.
<span class="reftext">44</span>Now <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> had testified that a prophet has no <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> in his own hometown.
<span class="reftext">45</span>Yet when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> arrived, the Galileans welcomed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. They had seen all the great things <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had gone there as well.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>So once again <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> came to Cana in Galilee, where <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had turned the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.
<span class="reftext">47</span>When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>Jesus said to him, <span>“Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">49</span>“Sir,” the official said, “come down before my child dies.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">50</span>“Go,”</span> said Jesus. <span>“Your son will live.”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> The man took Jesus at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> word and departed.
<span class="reftext">51</span>And while he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">52</span>So he inquired as to the hour when his son had recovered, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.<span class="fn">e</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">53</span>Then the father <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that this was the very hour in which Jesus had told him, <span>“Your son will live.”</span> And he and all his household believed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">54</span>This was now the second sign that Jesus performed after coming from Judea into Galilee.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">When therefore Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus</i>; NE, WH, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, about noon<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Tischendorf does not include this sentence.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">white</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">52</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, one in the afternoon<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
