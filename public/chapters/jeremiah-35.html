<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Obedience of the Rechabites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them to one of the chambers of the house of the LORD to offer them a drink of wine.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons—the entire house of the Rechabites—
<span class="reftext">4</span>and I brought them into the house of the LORD, to a chamber occupied by the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God. This room was near the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then I set pitchers full of wine and some cups before the men of the house of the Rechabites, and I said to them, “Drink some wine.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>“We do not drink wine,” they replied, “for our forefather Jonadab<span class="fn">a</span>  son of Rechab commanded us, ‘Neither you nor your descendants are ever to drink wine.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Nor are you ever to build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard. Those things are not for you. Instead, you must live in tents all your lives, so that you may live a long time in the land where you wander.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And we have obeyed the voice of our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab in all he commanded us. So we have not drunk wine all our lives—neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Nor have we built houses in which to live, and we have not owned any vineyards or fields or crops.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done exactly as our forefather Jonadab commanded us.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched into the land, we said: ‘Come, let us go into Jerusalem to escape the armies of the Chaldeans<span class="fn">b</span>  and the Arameans.’ So we have remained in Jerusalem.”
</p><p class="hdg">Judah Rebuked</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
<span class="reftext">13</span>“This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem: ‘Will you not accept discipline and obey My words?’ declares the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The words of Jonadab son of Rechab have been carried out. He commanded his sons not to drink wine, and they have not drunk it to this very day because they have obeyed the command of their forefather. But I have spoken to you again and again,<span class="fn">c</span>  and you have not obeyed Me!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Again and again I have sent you<span class="fn">d</span>  all My servants the prophets, proclaiming: ‘Turn now, each of you, from your wicked ways, and correct your actions. Do not go after other gods to serve them. Live in the land that I have given to you and your fathers.’ But you have not inclined your ear or listened to Me.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Yes, the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not listened to Me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore this is what the LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will bring to Judah and to all the residents of Jerusalem all the disaster I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them but they have not obeyed, and I have called to them but they have not answered.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites: “This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you have obeyed the command of your forefather Jonadab and have kept all his commandments and have done all that he charged you to do,
<span class="reftext">19</span>this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Jonadab son of Rechab will never fail to have a man to stand before Me.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Jonadab</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jehonadab</i>; here and throughout this chapter; see 2 Kings 10:15.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, the Babylonians<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">But I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Rising up early and sending (you), I have sent you</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
