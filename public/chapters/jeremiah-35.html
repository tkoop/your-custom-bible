<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Obedience of the Rechabites</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is the word that came to Jeremiah
from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:
“Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them, and bring them
to one of the chambers of the house of the LORD to offer them a drink
of wine.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the
son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons—the entire
house of the Rechabites— and I brought them into the house of the
LORD, to a chamber occupied by the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a
man of God. This room was near the chamber of the officials, which
was above the chamber of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I set pitchers full of wine and some
cups before the men of the house of the Rechabites, and I said to
them, “Drink some wine.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">We do not drink wine,” they replied,
“for our forefather Jonadab son of Rechab commanded us, ‘Neither
you nor your descendants are ever to drink wine. Nor are you ever to
build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard. Those things are not
for you. Instead, you must live in tents all your lives, so that you
may live a long time in the land where you wander.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And we have obeyed the voice of our
forefather Jonadab son of Rechab in all he commanded us. So we have
not drunk wine all our lives—neither we nor our wives nor our sons
and daughters. Nor have we built houses in which to live, and we have
not owned any vineyards or fields or crops. But we have lived in
tents and have obeyed and done exactly as our forefather Jonadab
commanded us. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
marched into the land, we said: ‘Come, let us go into Jerusalem to
escape the armies of the Chaldeans and the Arameans.’ So we have
remained in Jerusalem.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the word of the LORD came to
Jeremiah: “This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
Go and tell the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem: ‘Will
you not accept discipline and obey My words?’ declares the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The words of Jonadab son of Rechab have
been carried out. He commanded his sons not to drink wine, and they
have not drunk it to this very day because they have obeyed the
command of their forefather. But I have spoken to you again and
again, and you have not obeyed Me! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Again and again I have sent you all My
servants the prophets, proclaiming: ‘Turn now, each of you, from
your wicked ways, and correct your actions. Do not go after other
gods to serve them. Live in the land that I have given to you and
your fathers.’ But you have not inclined your ear or listened to
Me. Yes, the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab carried out the command
their forefather gave them, but these people have not listened to Me.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore this is what the LORD God of
Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will bring to Judah and
to all the residents of Jerusalem all the disaster I have pronounced
against them, because I have spoken to them but they have not obeyed,
and I have called to them but they have not answered.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jeremiah said to the house of the
Rechabites: “This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel,
says: ‘Because you have obeyed the command of your forefather
Jonadab and have kept all his commandments and have done all that he
charged you to do, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel,
says: Jonadab son of Rechab will never fail to have a man to stand
before Me.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
