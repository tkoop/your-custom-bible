<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Ananias and Sapphira</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property.
<span class="reftext">2</span>With his wife’s full knowledge, he kept back some of the proceeds for himself, but brought a portion and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it that Satan has filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and withhold some of the proceeds from the land?
<span class="reftext">4</span>Did it not belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How could you conceive such a deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>On hearing these words, Ananias fell down and died. And great fear came over all who heard what had happened.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then the young men stepped forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>About three hours later his wife also came in, unaware of what had happened.
<span class="reftext">8</span>“Tell me,” said Peter, “is this the price you and your husband got for the land?” </p><p class="reg1">“Yes,” she answered, “that is the price.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord?” Peter replied. “Look, the feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>At that instant she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And great fear came over the whole church and all who heard about these events.
</p><p class="hdg">The Apostles Heal Many</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>The apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people, and with one accord the believers gathered together in Solomon’s Colonnade.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Although the people regarded them highly, no one else dared to join them.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Yet more and more believers were brought to the Lord—large numbers of both men and women.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats, so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Crowds also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, and all of them were healed.
</p><p class="hdg">The Apostles Arrested and Freed</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then the high priest and all his associates, who belonged to the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy. They went out
<span class="reftext">18</span>and arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out, saying,
<span class="reftext">20</span>“Go, stand in the temple courts<span class="fn">a</span>  and tell the people the full message of this new life.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>At daybreak the apostles entered the temple courts as they had been told and began to teach the people. </p><p class="reg1"> When the high priest and his associates arrived, they convened the Sanhedrin<span class="fn">b</span>—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they returned with the report:
<span class="reftext">23</span>“We found the jail securely locked, with the guards posted at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Apostles before the Sanhedrin</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>When the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard this account, they were perplexed as to what was happening.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Then someone came in and announced, “Look, the men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>At that point, the captain went with the officers and brought the apostles—but not by force, for fear the people would stone them.
<span class="reftext">27</span>They brought them in and made them stand before the Sanhedrin, where the high priest interrogated them.
<span class="reftext">28</span>“We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” he said. “Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us responsible for this man’s blood.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>But Peter and the other apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than men.
<span class="reftext">30</span>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you had killed by hanging Him on a tree.
<span class="reftext">31</span>God exalted Him to His right hand as Prince and Savior, in order to grant repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.
<span class="reftext">32</span>We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.”
</p><p class="hdg">Gamaliel’s Advice</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>When the Council members heard this, they were enraged, and they resolved<span class="fn">d</span>  to put the apostles to death.
<span class="reftext">34</span>But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a short time.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>“Men of Israel,” he said, “consider carefully what you are about to do to these men.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men joined him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing.
<span class="reftext">37</span>After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and drew away people after him. He too perished, and all his followers were scattered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>So in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone. Let them go! For if their purpose or endeavor is of human origin, it will fail.
<span class="reftext">39</span>But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop them. You may even find yourselves fighting against God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>At this, they yielded to Gamaliel. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.
<span class="reftext">42</span>Every day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they did not stop teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i>; also in verses 21, 25, and 42<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Council</i>; also in verses 27, 34, and 41<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">as to what this might be</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> ECM, BYZ, TR, and Tischendorf; or <i class="calibre6">they took counsel</i>; NA, SBL, NE, and WH <i class="calibre6">they wanted</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
