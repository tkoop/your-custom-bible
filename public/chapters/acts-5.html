<font ><b>Ananias and Sapphira</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now a man named Ananias, together with his
wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. With his wife’s full
knowledge, he kept back some of the proceeds for himself, but brought
a portion and laid it at the apostles’ feet. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Peter said, “Ananias, how is it
that Satan has filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and
withhold some of the proceeds from the land? Did it not belong to you
before it was sold? And after it was sold, was it not at your
disposal? How could you conceive such a deed in your heart? You have
not lied to men, but to God!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On hearing these words, Ananias fell down
and died. And great fear came over all who heard what had happened.
Then the young men stepped forward, wrapped up his body, and carried
him out and buried him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >About three hours later his wife also came
in, unaware of what had happened. “Tell me,” said Peter, “is
this the price you and your husband got for the land?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Yes,” she answered, “that is the
price.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >How could you agree to test the Spirit
of the Lord?” Peter replied. “Look, the feet of the men who
buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out
also.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that instant she fell down at his feet
and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried
her out and buried her beside her husband. And great fear came over
the whole church and all who heard about these events. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The apostles performed many signs and
wonders among the people, and with one accord the believers gathered
together in Solomon’s Colonnade. Although the people regarded them
highly, no one else dared to join them. Yet more and more believers
were brought to the Lord—large numbers of both men and women. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As a result, people brought the sick into
the streets and laid them on cots and mats, so that at least Peter’s
shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. Crowds also
gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those
tormented by unclean spirits, and all of them were healed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the high priest and all his
associates, who belonged to the party of the Sadducees, were filled
with jealousy. They went out and arrested the apostles and put them
in the public jail. But during the night an angel of the Lord opened
the doors of the jail and brought them out, saying, “Go, stand in
the temple courts and tell the people the full message of this new
life.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At daybreak the apostles entered the
temple courts as they had been told and began to teach the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the high priest and his associates
arrived, they convened the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the
elders of Israel—and sent to the jail for the apostles. But on
arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they
returned with the report: “We found the jail securely locked, with
the guards posted at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no
one inside.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the captain of the temple guard and
the chief priests heard this account, they were perplexed as to what
was happening. Then someone came in and announced, “Look, the men
you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the
people!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that point, the captain went with the
officers and brought the apostles—but not by force, for fear the
people would stone them. They brought them in and made them stand
before the Sanhedrin, where the high priest interrogated them. “We
gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” he said. “Yet
you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to
make us responsible for this man’s blood.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Peter and the other apostles replied,
“We must obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up
Jesus, whom you had killed by hanging Him on a tree. God exalted Him
to His right hand as Prince and Savior, in order to grant repentance
and forgiveness of sins to Israel. We are witnesses of these things,
and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Council members heard this, they
were enraged, and they resolved to put the apostles to death. But a
Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was honored by all
the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put
outside for a short time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Men of Israel,” he said, “consider
carefully what you are about to do to these men. Some time ago
Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men
joined him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it
all came to nothing. After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the
days of the census and drew away people after him. He too perished,
and all his followers were scattered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So in the present case I advise you: Leave
these men alone. Let them go! For if their purpose or endeavor is of
human origin, it will fail. But if it is from God, you will not be
able to stop them. You may even find yourselves fighting against
God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, they yielded to Gamaliel. They
called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them
not to speak in the name of Jesus, and released them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing
that they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.
Every day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they did not
stop teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.
