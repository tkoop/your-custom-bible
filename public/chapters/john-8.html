<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Woman Caught in Adultery</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Early in the morning <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> went back into the temple courts.<span class="fn">a</span>  All the people came to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> sat down to teach them.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The scribes and Pharisees, however, brought to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before them
<span class="reftext">4</span>and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
<span class="reftext">5</span>In the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> say?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>They said this to test <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, in order to have a basis for accusing <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> finger.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>When they continued to question <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> straightened up and said to them, <span>“Let him who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.”</span>
<span class="reftext">8</span>And again <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> bent down and wrote on the ground.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>When they heard this,<span class="fn">b</span>  they began to go away one by one, beginning with the older ones, until only Jesus was left, with the woman standing there.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Then Jesus straightened up<span class="fn">c</span>  and asked her, <span>“Woman, where are your accusers?<span class="fn">d</span>  Has no one condemned you?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>“No one, Lord,” she answered. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“Then neither do I condemn you,”</span> Jesus declared. <span>“Now go and sin no more.” </span>
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus the Light of the World<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 John 1:5–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Once again, Jesus spoke to the people and said, <span>“I am the light of the world. Whoever follows <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So the Pharisees said to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “You are testifying about <span class='cap'>Yourself</span><span class='nocap'>yourself</span>; <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> testimony is not valid.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Even if I testify about <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span>, <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going.
<span class="reftext">15</span>You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
<span class="reftext">16</span>But even if I do judge, <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> is true, because I am not alone; I am with the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> who sent <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Even in your own <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">18</span>I am <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who testifies about <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span>, and the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, who sent <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, also testifies about <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>“Where is <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>?” they asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“You do not know <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> or <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>,”</span> Jesus answered. <span>“If you knew <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, you would know <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> as well.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts, near the treasury. Yet no one seized <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, because <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hour had not yet come.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Again <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said to them, <span>“I am going away, and you will look for <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So the Jews began to ask, “Will <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> kill <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span>, since <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> says, <span>‘Where I am going, you cannot come’</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> told them, <span>“You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
<span class="reftext">24</span>That is why I told you that you would die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span>, you will die in your sins.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>“Who are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>?” they asked. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,”</span> Jesus replied.
<span><span class="reftext">26</span>“I have much to say about you and much to judge. But the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who sent <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> is truthful, and what I have heard from <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, I tell the world.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>They did not understand that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was telling them about the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>.
<span class="reftext">28</span>So Jesus said, <span>“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span>, and that I do nothing on <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> own, but speak exactly what the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> has taught <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
<span class="reftext">29</span>He who sent <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> is with <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>. He has not left <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> alone, because I always do what pleases <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Truth Will Set You Free<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 John 1:4–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>As Jesus spoke these things, many believed in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">31</span>So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said to the Jews who had believed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, <span>“If you continue in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> word, you are truly <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> disciples.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>“We are Abraham’s descendants,” they answered. “We have never been slaves to anyone. How can <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> say we will be set free?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
<span class="reftext">35</span>A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son belongs to it forever.
<span class="reftext">36</span>So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">37</span>I know you are Abraham’s descendants, but you are trying to kill <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> because <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> word has no place within you.
<span class="reftext">38</span>I speak of what I have seen in the presence of the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, and you do what you have heard from your father.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>“Abraham is our father,” they replied. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“If you were children of Abraham,”</span> said Jesus, <span>“you would do the works of Abraham.
<span class="reftext">40</span>But now you are trying to kill <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing.
<span class="reftext">41</span>You are doing the works of your father.”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“We are not illegitimate children,” they declared. “Our only <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> is God <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“If God were your <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, you would love <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, for I have come here from God. I have not come on <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> own, but <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> sent <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">43</span>Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> message.
<span class="reftext">44</span>You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, refusing to uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, because he is a liar and the father of lies.
<span class="reftext">45</span>But because I speak the truth, you do not believe <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>!
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">46</span>Which of you can prove <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> guilty of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>?
<span class="reftext">47</span>Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”
</p><p class="hdg">Before Abraham Was Born, I Am</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>The Jews answered <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Are we not right to say that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> are a Samaritan and <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have a demon?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">49</span>“I do not have a demon,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“but I <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, and you dishonor <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
<span class="reftext">50</span>I do not seek <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> own glory.

<span class="reftext">51</span>Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> word, he will never see death.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">52</span>“Now we know that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have a demon!” declared the Jews. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> say that anyone who keeps <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> word will never taste death.
<span class="reftext">53</span>Are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> greater than our father Abraham? He died, as did the prophets. Who do <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> claim to be?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">54</span>Jesus answered, <span>“If I glorify <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span>, <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> glory means nothing. The <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who glorifies <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> is <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, of whom you say ‘He is our<span class="fn">g</span>  God.’
<span class="reftext">55</span>You do not know <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, but I know <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. If I said I did not know <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, I would be a liar like you. But I do know <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, and I keep <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> word.
<span class="reftext">56</span>Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> day. He saw it and was glad.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">57</span>Then the Jews said to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “You are not yet fifty years old, and <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have seen Abraham?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">58</span>“Truly, truly, I tell you,”</span> Jesus declared, <span>“before Abraham was born, I am!<span class="fn">h</span>”</span>
