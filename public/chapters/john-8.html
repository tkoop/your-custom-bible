<font ><b>The Woman Caught in Adultery</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Early in the morning He went back into the
temple courts. All the people came to Him, and He sat down to teach
them. The scribes and Pharisees, however, brought to Him a woman
caught in adultery. They made her stand before them and said,
“Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law
Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do You say?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They said this to test Him, in order to
have a basis for accusing Him. But Jesus bent down and began to write
on the ground with His finger. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they continued to question Him, He
straightened up and said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Let him
who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.”</font>
And again He bent down and wrote on the ground. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they heard this, they began to go
away one by one, beginning with the older ones, until only Jesus was
left, with the woman standing there. Then Jesus straightened up and
asked her, <font color="#a80000">“Woman, where are your accusers?
Has no one condemned you?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >No one, Lord,” she answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Then neither do I
condemn you,”</font> Jesus declared. <font color="#a80000">“Now
go and sin no more.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once again, Jesus spoke to the people and
said, <font color="#a80000">“I am the light of the world. Whoever
follows Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light
of life.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are
testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Even
if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know
where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I
came from or where I am going. You judge according to the flesh; I
judge no one. But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I
am not alone; I am with the Father who sent Me. Even in your own Law
it is written that the testimony of two men is valid. I am One who
testifies about Myself, and the Father, who sent Me, also testifies
about Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Where is Your Father?” they asked
Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >You do not know
Me or My Father,”</font> Jesus answered. <font color="#a80000">“If
you knew Me, you would know My Father as well.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He spoke these words while teaching in the
temple courts, near the treasury. Yet no one seized Him, because His
hour had not yet come. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again He said to them, <font color="#a80000">“I
am going away, and you will look for Me, but you will die in your
sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the Jews began to ask, “Will He kill
Himself, since He says, <font color="#a80000">‘Where I am going,
you cannot come’</font>?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He told them, <font color="#a80000">“You
are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of
this world. That is why I told you that you would die in your sins.
For unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Who are You?” they asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Just what I have
been telling you from the beginning,”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“I
have much to say about you and much to judge. But the One who sent Me
is truthful, and what I have heard from Him, I tell the world.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They did not understand that He was
telling them about the Father. So Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“When
you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He,
and that I do nothing on My own, but speak exactly what the Father
has taught Me. He who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone,
because I always do what pleases Him.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Jesus spoke these things, many believed
in Him. So He said to the Jews who had believed Him, <font color="#a80000">“If
you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples. Then you will
know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >We are Abraham’s descendants,” they
answered. “We have never been slaves to anyone. How can You say we
will be set free?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Truly,
truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. A slave is
not a permanent member of the family, but a son belongs to it
forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >I know you are
Abraham’s descendants, but you are trying to kill Me because My
word has no place within you. I speak of what I have seen in the
presence of the Father, and you do what you have heard from your
father.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Abraham is our father,” they replied.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >If you were
children of Abraham,”</font> said Jesus, <font color="#a80000">“you
would do the works of Abraham. But now you are trying to kill Me, a
man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham never
did such a thing. You are doing the works of your father.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >We are not illegitimate children,”
they declared. “Our only Father is God Himself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“If
God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come here from
God. I have not come on My own, but He sent Me.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Why do you not
understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept
My message. You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to
carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, refusing
to uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies,
he speaks his native language, because he is a liar and the father of
lies. But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me! </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Which of you can
prove Me guilty of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe
Me? Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you do
not hear is that you do not belong to God.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Jews answered Him, “Are we not right
to say that You are a Samaritan and You have a demon?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >I do not have a
demon,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“but I honor
My Father, and you dishonor Me. I do not seek My own glory. There is
One who seeks it, and He is the Judge. Truly, truly, I tell you, if
anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Now we know that You have a demon!”
declared the Jews. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet You
say that anyone who keeps Your word will never taste death. Are You
greater than our father Abraham? He died, as did the prophets. Who do
You claim to be?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“If
I glorify Myself, My glory means nothing. The One who glorifies Me is
My Father, of whom you say ‘He is our God.’ You do not know Him,
but I know Him. If I said I did not know Him, I would be a liar like
you. But I do know Him, and I keep His word. Your father Abraham
rejoiced that he would see My day. He saw it and was glad.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Jews said to Him, “You are not
yet fifty years old, and You have seen Abraham?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Truly, truly, I
tell you,”</font> Jesus declared, <font color="#a80000">“before
Abraham was born, I am!”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, they picked up stones to throw at
Him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple area. </font>
