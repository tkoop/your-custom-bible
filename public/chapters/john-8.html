<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Woman Caught in Adultery</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Early in the morning He went back into the temple courts.<span class="fn">a</span>  All the people came to Him, and He sat down to teach them.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The scribes and Pharisees, however, brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before them
<span class="reftext">4</span>and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
<span class="reftext">5</span>In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do You say?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>They said this to test Him, in order to have a basis for accusing Him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with His finger.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>When they continued to question Him, He straightened up and said to them, <span>“Let him who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.”</span>
<span class="reftext">8</span>And again He bent down and wrote on the ground.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>When they heard this,<span class="fn">b</span>  they began to go away one by one, beginning with the older ones, until only Jesus was left, with the woman standing there.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Then Jesus straightened up<span class="fn">c</span>  and asked her, <span>“Woman, where are your accusers?<span class="fn">d</span>  Has no one condemned you?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>“No one, Lord,” she answered. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“Then neither do I condemn you,”</span> Jesus declared. <span>“Now go and sin no more.” </span>
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus the Light of the World<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 John 1:5–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Once again, Jesus spoke to the people and said, <span>“I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going.
<span class="reftext">15</span>You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.
<span class="reftext">16</span>But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone; I am with the Father who sent Me.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Even in your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">18</span>I am One who testifies about Myself, and the Father, who sent Me, also testifies about Me.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>“Where is Your Father?” they asked Him. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“You do not know Me or My Father,”</span> Jesus answered. <span>“If you knew Me, you would know My Father as well.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts, near the treasury. Yet no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Again He said to them, <span>“I am going away, and you will look for Me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So the Jews began to ask, “Will He kill Himself, since He says, <span>‘Where I am going, you cannot come’</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then He told them, <span>“You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
<span class="reftext">24</span>That is why I told you that you would die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>“Who are You?” they asked. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,”</span> Jesus replied.
<span><span class="reftext">26</span>“I have much to say about you and much to judge. But the One who sent Me is truthful, and what I have heard from Him, I tell the world.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>They did not understand that He was telling them about the Father.
<span class="reftext">28</span>So Jesus said, <span>“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on My own, but speak exactly what the Father has taught Me.
<span class="reftext">29</span>He who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what pleases Him.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Truth Will Set You Free<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 John 1:4–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>As Jesus spoke these things, many believed in Him.
<span class="reftext">31</span>So He said to the Jews who had believed Him, <span>“If you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>“We are Abraham’s descendants,” they answered. “We have never been slaves to anyone. How can You say we will be set free?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
<span class="reftext">35</span>A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son belongs to it forever.
<span class="reftext">36</span>So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">37</span>I know you are Abraham’s descendants, but you are trying to kill Me because My word has no place within you.
<span class="reftext">38</span>I speak of what I have seen in the presence of the Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>“Abraham is our father,” they replied. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“If you were children of Abraham,”</span> said Jesus, <span>“you would do the works of Abraham.
<span class="reftext">40</span>But now you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing.
<span class="reftext">41</span>You are doing the works of your father.”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“We are not illegitimate children,” they declared. “Our only Father is God Himself.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on My own, but He sent Me.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">43</span>Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept My message.
<span class="reftext">44</span>You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, refusing to uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, because he is a liar and the father of lies.
<span class="reftext">45</span>But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me!
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">46</span>Which of you can prove Me guilty of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe Me?
<span class="reftext">47</span>Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”
</p><p class="hdg">Before Abraham Was Born, I Am</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>The Jews answered Him, “Are we not right to say that You are a Samaritan and You have a demon?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">49</span>“I do not have a demon,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“but I honour My Father, and you dishonour Me.
<span class="reftext">50</span>I do not seek My own glory. There is One who seeks it, and He is the Judge.
<span class="reftext">51</span>Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">52</span>“Now we know that You have a demon!” declared the Jews. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet You say that anyone who keeps Your word will never taste death.
<span class="reftext">53</span>Are You greater than our father Abraham? He died, as did the prophets. Who do You claim to be?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">54</span>Jesus answered, <span>“If I glorify Myself, My glory means nothing. The One who glorifies Me is My Father, of whom you say ‘He is our<span class="fn">g</span>  God.’
<span class="reftext">55</span>You do not know Him, but I know Him. If I said I did not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know Him, and I keep His word.
<span class="reftext">56</span>Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see My day. He saw it and was glad.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">57</span>Then the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and You have seen Abraham?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">58</span>“Truly, truly, I tell you,”</span> Jesus declared, <span>“before Abraham was born, I am!<span class="fn">h</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">59</span>At this, they picked up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple area.<span class="fn">i</span> </p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i>; also in verse 20<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> NE, BYZ, and TR include <i class="calibre6">and were convicted by their conscience,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> NE, BYZ, and TR include <i class="calibre6">and saw no one but the woman</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> WH and NA <i class="calibre6">where are they</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">but (it is) I and the Father who sent Me</i>; NE <i class="calibre6">but (it is) I and the One who sent Me</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> See Deuteronomy 19:15.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">54</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> WH and TR <i class="calibre6">Your</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">58</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">before Abraham was, I am!</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">59</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">going through the midst of them, and so He passed by</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
