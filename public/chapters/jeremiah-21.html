<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jerusalem Will Fall to Babylon</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malchijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Please inquire of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> on our behalf, since Nebuchadnezzar<span class="fn">a</span>  king of Babylon is waging war against us. Perhaps <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will perform for us something like all <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> past wonders, so that Nebuchadnezzar will withdraw from us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But Jeremiah answered, “You are to tell Zedekiah that
<span class="reftext">4</span>this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will turn against you the weapons of war in your hands, with which you are fighting the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans<span class="fn">b</span>  who besiege you outside the wall, and I will assemble their forces in the <span class='spell ca'>centre</span><span class='spell gb'>centre</span><span class='spell us'>center</span> of this city.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And I <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span> will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, with anger, fury, and great wrath.
<span class="reftext">6</span>I will strike down the residents of this city, both man and beast. They will die in a terrible plague.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>‘After that,’ declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, ‘I will hand over Zedekiah king of Judah, his officers, and the people in this city who survive the plague and sword and famine, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who seek their lives. He will put them to the sword; he will not spare them or show pity or compassion.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Furthermore, you are to tell this people that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Whoever stays in this city will die by sword and famine and plague, but whoever goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who besiege you will live; he will retain his life like a spoil of war.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For I have set <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> face against this city to bring disaster and not good, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. It will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, who will destroy it with fire.’
