<font >Thus the heavens and the earth were
completed in all their vast array. And by the seventh day God had
finished the work He had been doing; so on that day He rested from
all His work. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then God blessed the seventh day and
sanctified it, because on that day He rested from all the work of
creation that He had accomplished. </font>

<font >Now no shrub of the field had yet appeared
on the earth, nor had any plant of the field sprouted; for the LORD
God had not yet sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to
cultivate the ground. But springs welled up from the earth and
watered the whole surface of the ground. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD God formed man from the dust
of the ground and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils, and
the man became a living being. </font>

<font >And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden,
in the east, where He placed the man He had formed. Out of the ground
the LORD God gave growth to every tree that is pleasing to the eye
and good for food. And in the middle of the garden were the tree of
life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now a river flowed out of Eden to water
the garden, and from there it branched into four headwaters: </font>

<font >The name of the first river is Pishon; it
winds through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. And the
gold of that land is pure, and bdellium and onyx are found there. </font>

<font >Then the LORD God took the man and placed
him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it. </font>

<font >And the LORD God commanded him, “You may
eat freely from every tree of the garden, but you must not eat from
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you
eat of it, you will surely die.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD God also said, “It is not good
for the man to be alone. I will make for him a suitable helper.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And out of the ground the LORD God formed
every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and He brought
them to the man to see what he would name each one. And whatever the
man called each living creature, that was its name. The man gave
names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every
beast of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the LORD God caused the man to fall
into a deep sleep, and while he slept, He took one of the man’s
ribs and closed up the area with flesh. And from the rib that the
LORD God had taken from the man, He made a woman and brought her to
him. And the man said: </font>

“<font >This is now bone of my bones </font>
