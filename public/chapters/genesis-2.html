<span class="reftext">2</span>And by the seventh day God had finished the work <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had been doing; so on that day <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> rested from all <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> work.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on that day <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> rested from all the work of creation that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had accomplished.
</p><p class="hdg">Man and Woman in the Garden</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span><span class="fn">b</span>  God made them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth, nor had any plant of the field sprouted; for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God had not yet sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But springs<span class="fn">c</span>  welled up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils, and the man became a living being.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, where <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> placed the man <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had formed.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Out of the ground <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God gave growth to every tree that is pleasing to the eye and good for food. And in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it branched into four headwaters:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>The name of the first river is Pishon; it winds through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And the gold of that land is pure, and bdellium and onyx are found there.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>The name of the second river is Gihon; it winds through the whole land of Cush.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it runs along the east side of Assyria. </p><p class="list1stline"> And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God took the man and placed him in the <span class='cap'>Garden</span><span class='nocap'>garden</span><span class='bsb'>Garden</span> of Eden to cultivate and keep it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God commanded him, “You may eat freely from every tree of the garden,
<span class="reftext">17</span>but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> God also said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make for him a suitable helper.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And out of the ground <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> brought them to the man to see what he would name each one. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
<span class="reftext">20</span>The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam<span class="fn">e</span>  no suitable helper was found.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> took one of the man’s ribs<span class="fn">f</span>  and closed up the area with flesh.
<span class="reftext">22</span>And from the rib that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God had taken from the man, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> made a woman and brought her to him.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And the man said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“This is now bone of my bones </p><p class="indent"> and flesh of my flesh; </p><p class="indent1"> she shall be called ‘woman,’ </p><p class="indent"> for out of man she was taken.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>And the man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in Hebrews 4:4<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></i> or <i class="calibre6">GOD</i>, with capital letters, represents the proper name of the God of Israel and the one true God, transliterated from the Hebrew as <i class="calibre6">YHWH</i>; here and throughout the Scriptures.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">mist</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a living soul</i>; cited in 1 Corinthians 15:45<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the man</i>, as in verses 19 and 21<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">took part of the man’s side</i>; similarly in verse 22<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">and the two will become one flesh</i>; cited in Matthew 19:5, Mark 10:7–8, 1 Corinthians 6:16, and Ephesians 5:31<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
