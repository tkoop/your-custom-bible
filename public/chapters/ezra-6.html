<font face="Tahoma, serif">Thus King Darius ordered a search of the
archives stored in the treasury of Babylon. And a scroll was found in
the fortress of Ecbatana, in the province of Media, with the
following written on it: </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Let the house be rebuilt as a place for
offering sacrifices, and let its foundations be firmly laid. It is to
be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide, with three layers of cut
stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid from the royal
treasury. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The cost is to be paid in full to these
men from the royal treasury out of the taxes of the provinces west of

needed—young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God
of heaven, as well as wheat, salt, wine, and oil, as requested by the
priests in Jerusalem—must be given to them daily without fail. Then
they will be able to offer sacrifices of a sweet aroma to the God of
heaven and to pray for the lives of the king and his sons. </font>

up, and he is to be impaled on it. And his own house shall be made a

dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to alter
this decree or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">In response, Tattenai the governor of the
