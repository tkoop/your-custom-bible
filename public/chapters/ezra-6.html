<font ><b>The Decree of Darius</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus King Darius ordered a search of the
archives stored in the treasury of Babylon. And a scroll was found in
the fortress of Ecbatana, in the province of Media, with the
following written on it: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Memorandum: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued
a decree concerning the house of God in Jerusalem: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Let the house be rebuilt as a place for
offering sacrifices, and let its foundations be firmly laid. It is to
be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide, with three layers of cut
stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid from the royal
treasury. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Furthermore, the gold and silver articles
of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in
Jerusalem and carried to Babylon, must also be returned to the temple
in Jerusalem and deposited in the house of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore Darius decreed: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >To Tattenai governor of the region west of
the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates and officials in
the region: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You must stay away from that place! Leave
this work on the house of God alone. Let the governor and elders of
the Jews rebuild this house of God on its original site. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I hereby decree what you must do for these
elders of the Jews who are rebuilding this house of God: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The cost is to be paid in full to these
men from the royal treasury out of the taxes of the provinces west of
the Euphrates, so that the work will not be hindered. Whatever is
needed—young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God
of heaven, as well as wheat, salt, wine, and oil, as requested by the
priests in Jerusalem—must be given to them daily without fail. Then
they will be able to offer sacrifices of a sweet aroma to the God of
heaven and to pray for the lives of the king and his sons. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I also decree that if any man interferes
with this directive, a beam is to be torn from his house and raised
up, and he is to be impaled on it. And his own house shall be made a
pile of rubble for this offense. May God, who has caused His Name to
dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to alter
this decree or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I, Darius, have issued the decree. Let it
be carried out with diligence. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In response, Tattenai the governor of the
region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates
diligently carried out what King Darius had decreed. So the Jewish
elders built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the
prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They finished building according to the
command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius, and
Artaxerxes, kings of Persia. And this temple was completed on the
third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of
King Darius. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the people of Israel—the priests,
the Levites, and the rest of the exiles—celebrated the dedication
of the house of God with joy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the dedication of the house of God
they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs,
and a sin offering for all Israel of twelve male goats, one for each
tribe of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They also appointed the priests by their
divisions and the Levites by their groups to the service of God in
Jerusalem, according to what is written in the Book of Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the fourteenth day of the first month,
the exiles kept the Passover. All the priests and Levites had
purified themselves and were ceremonially clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the Levites slaughtered the Passover
lamb for all the exiles, for their priestly brothers, and for
themselves. The Israelites who had returned from exile ate it,
together with all who had separated themselves from the uncleanness
of the peoples of the land to seek the LORD, the God of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For seven days they kept the Feast of
Unleavened Bread with joy, because the LORD had made them joyful and
turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to strengthen
their hands in the work on the house of the God of Israel. </font>
