<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Solomon’s Foreign Wives</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">King Solomon, however, loved many foreign
women along with the daughter of Pharaoh—women of Moab, Ammon,
Edom, and Sidon, as well as Hittite women. These women were from the
nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, “You must not
intermarry with them, for surely they will turn your hearts after
their gods.” Yet Solomon clung to these women in love. He had seven
hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines—and his
wives turned his heart away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For when Solomon grew old, his wives
turned his heart after other gods, and he was not wholeheartedly
devoted to the LORD his God, as his father David had been. Solomon
followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and Milcom the
abomination of the Ammonites. So Solomon did evil in the sight of the
LORD; unlike his father David, he did not follow the LORD completely.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time on a hill east of Jerusalem,
Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab and
for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites. He did the same for all
his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the LORD grew angry with Solomon,
because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel,
who had appeared to him twice. Although He had warned Solomon
explicitly not to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD’s
command. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Solomon, “Because
you have done this and have not kept My covenant and My statutes,
which I have commanded you, I will tear the kingdom away from you and
give it to your servant. Nevertheless, for the sake of your father
David, I will not do it during your lifetime; I will tear it out of
the hand of your son. Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom away from
him. I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant
David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an
adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Earlier, when David was in Edom, Joab the
commander of the army had gone to bury the dead and had struck down
every male in Edom. Joab and all Israel had stayed there six months,
until he had killed every male in Edom. But Hadad, still just a young
boy, had fled to Egypt, along with some Edomites who were servants of
his father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Hadad and his men set out from Midian and
went to Paran. They took men from Paran with them and went to Egypt,
to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and
provided him with food. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">There Hadad found such great favor in the
sight of Pharaoh that he gave to him in marriage the sister of Queen
Tahpenes, his own wife. And the sister of Tahpenes bore Hadad a son
named Genubath. Tahpenes herself weaned him in Pharaoh’s palace,
and Genubath lived there among the sons of Pharaoh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had
rested with his fathers and that Joab, the commander of the army, was
dead, he said to Pharaoh, “Let me go, that I may return to my own
country.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Pharaoh asked him, “What have you
lacked here with me that you suddenly want to go back to your own
country?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nothing,” Hadad replied, “but
please let me go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And God raised up against Solomon another
adversary, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master,
Hadadezer king of Zobah, and had gathered men to himself. When David
killed the Zobaites, Rezon captained a band of raiders and went to
Damascus, where they settled and gained control. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Rezon was Israel’s enemy throughout the
days of Solomon, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon
ruled over Aram with hostility toward Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Jeroboam son of Nebat was an
Ephraimite from Zeredah whose mother was a widow named Zeruah.
Jeroboam was a servant of Solomon, but he rebelled against the king,
and this is the account of his rebellion against the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon had built the supporting terraces
and repaired the gap in the wall of the city of his father David. Now
Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor. So when Solomon noticed that the
young man was industrious, he put him in charge of the whole labor
force of the house of Joseph. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">During that time, the prophet Ahijah the
Shilonite met Jeroboam on the road as he was going out of Jerusalem.
Now Ahijah had wrapped himself in a new cloak, and the two of them
were alone in the open field. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he
was wearing, tore it into twelve pieces, and said to Jeroboam, “Take
ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of
Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of
Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes. But one tribe will remain
for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the
city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For they have forsaken Me to worship
Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the
Moabites, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites. They have not walked
in My ways, nor done what is right in My eyes, nor kept My statutes
and judgments, as Solomon’s father David did. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nevertheless, I will not take the whole
kingdom out of Solomon’s hand, because I have made him ruler all
the days of his life for the sake of David My servant, whom I chose
because he kept My commandments and statutes. But I will take ten
tribes of the kingdom from the hand of his son and give them to you.
I will give one tribe to his son, so that My servant David will
always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to
put My Name. But as for you, I will take you, and you shall reign
over all that your heart desires, and you will be king over Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If you listen to all that I command you,
walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight in order to keep My
statutes and commandments as My servant David did, then I will be
with you. I will build you a lasting dynasty just as I built for
David, and I will give Israel to you. Because of this, I will humble
David’s descendants—but not forever.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam.
But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, where
he remained until the death of Solomon. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">As for the rest of the acts of Solomon—all
that he did, as well as his wisdom—are they not written in the Book
of the Acts of Solomon? Thus the time that Solomon reigned in
Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Solomon rested with his fathers and
was buried in the city of his father David. And his son Rehoboam
reigned in his place. </font>
