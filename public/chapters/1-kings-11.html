<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Solomon’s Foreign Wives</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women along with the daughter of Pharaoh—women of Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Sidon, as well as Hittite women.
<span class="reftext">2</span>These women were from the nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry with them, for surely they will turn your hearts after their gods.” Yet Solomon clung to these women in love.
<span class="reftext">3</span>He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines—and his wives turned his heart away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>For when Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and he was not wholeheartedly devoted to the LORD his God, as his father David had been.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Solomon followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and Milcom<span class="fn">a</span>  the abomination of the Ammonites.
<span class="reftext">6</span>So Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD; unlike his father David, he did not follow the LORD completely.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>At that time on a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites.
<span class="reftext">8</span>He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Anger against Solomon</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Now the LORD grew angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Although He had warned Solomon explicitly not to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD’s command.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then the LORD said to Solomon, “Because you have done this and have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you, I will tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Nevertheless, for the sake of your father David, I will not do it during your lifetime; I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom away from him. I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.”
</p><p class="hdg">Hadad’s Return</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Earlier, when David was in Edom, Joab the commander of the army had gone to bury the dead and had struck down every male in Edom.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Joab and all Israel had stayed there six months, until he had killed every male in Edom.
<span class="reftext">17</span>But Hadad, still just a young boy, had fled to Egypt, along with some Edomites who were servants of his father.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Hadad and his men set out from Midian and went to Paran. They took men from Paran with them and went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>There Hadad found such great <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in the sight of Pharaoh that he gave to him in marriage the sister of Queen Tahpenes, his own wife.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the sister of Tahpenes bore Hadad a son named Genubath. Tahpenes herself weaned him in Pharaoh’s palace, and Genubath lived there among the sons of Pharaoh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>When Hadad heard in Egypt that David had rested with his fathers and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead, he said to Pharaoh, “Let me go, that I may return to my own country.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But Pharaoh asked him, “What have you lacked here with me that you suddenly want to go back to your own country?” </p><p class="reg1">“Nothing,” Hadad replied, “but please let me go.”
</p><p class="hdg">Rezon’s Hostility</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah,
<span class="reftext">24</span>and had gathered men to himself. When David killed the Zobaites, Rezon captained a band of raiders and went to Damascus, where they settled and gained control.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Rezon was Israel’s enemy throughout the days of Solomon, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled over Aram with hostility toward Israel.
</p><p class="hdg">Jeroboam’s Rebellion</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Now Jeroboam son of Nebat was an Ephraimite from Zeredah whose mother was a widow named Zeruah. Jeroboam was a servant of Solomon, but he rebelled against the king,
<span class="reftext">27</span>and this is the account of his rebellion against the king. </p><p class="reg1"> Solomon had built the supporting terraces<span class="fn">b</span>  and repaired the gap in the wall of the city of his father David.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Now Jeroboam was a mighty man of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span>. So when Solomon noticed that the young man was industrious, he put him in charge of the whole <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> force of the house of Joseph.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>During that time, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met Jeroboam on the road as he was going out of Jerusalem. Now Ahijah had wrapped himself in a new cloak, and the two of them were alone in the open field.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>And Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing, tore it into twelve pieces,
<span class="reftext">31</span>and said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I will give you ten tribes.
<span class="reftext">32</span>But one tribe will remain for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>For they have<span class="fn">c</span>  forsaken Me to worship Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites. They have not walked in My ways, nor done what is right in My eyes, nor kept My statutes and <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span>, as Solomon’s father David did.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon’s hand, because I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David My servant, whom I chose because he kept My commandments and statutes.
<span class="reftext">35</span>But I will take ten tribes of the kingdom from the hand of his son and give them to you.
<span class="reftext">36</span>I will give one tribe to his son, so that My servant David will always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put My Name.
<span class="reftext">37</span>But as for you, I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your heart desires, and you will be king over Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>If you listen to all that I command you, walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight in order to keep My statutes and commandments as My servant David did, then I will be with you. I will build you a lasting dynasty just as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.
<span class="reftext">39</span>Because of this, I will humble David’s descendants—but not forever.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Solomon therefore sought to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, where he remained until the death of Solomon.
</p><p class="hdg">The Death of Solomon<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 9:29–31)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>As for the rest of the acts of Solomon—all that he did, as well as his wisdom—are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?
<span class="reftext">42</span>Thus the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>And Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. And his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Milcom</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Molech</i>; also in verse 33; see verse 7 and Leviticus 18:21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the Millo</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew; LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate <i class="calibre6">he has</i>; twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
