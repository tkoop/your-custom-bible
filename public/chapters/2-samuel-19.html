<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>David Restored as King</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then it was reported to Joab, “The king
is weeping and mourning over Absalom.” And that day’s victory was
turned into mourning for all the people, because on that day they
were told, “The king is grieving over his son.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they returned to the city quietly that
day, as people steal away in humiliation after fleeing a battle. But
the king covered his face and cried out at the top of his voice, “O
my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Joab went into the house and said to
the king, “Today you have disgraced all your servants who have
saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters, of your
wives, and of your concubines. You love those who hate you and hate
those who love you! For you have made it clear today that the
commanders and soldiers mean nothing to you. I know today that if
Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, it would have pleased
you! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now therefore get up! Go out and speak
comfort to your servants, for I swear by the LORD that if you do not
go out, not a man will remain with you tonight. This will be worse
for you than all the adversity that has befallen you from your youth
until now!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king got up and sat in the gate,
and all the people were told: “Behold, the king is sitting in the
gate.” So they all came before the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled, each
man to his home. And all the people throughout the tribes of Israel
were arguing, “The king rescued us from the hand of our enemies and
delivered us from the hand of the Philistines, but now he has fled
the land because of Absalom. But Absalom, the man we anointed over
us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about restoring the
king?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King David sent this message to Zadok
and Abiathar, the priests: “Say to the elders of Judah, ‘Why
should you be the last to restore the king to his palace, since the
talk of all Israel has reached the king at his quarters? You are my
brothers, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to
restore the king?’ And say to Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my flesh and
blood? May God punish me, and ever so severely, if from this time you
are not the commander of my army in place of Joab!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So he swayed the hearts of all the men of
Judah as though they were one man, and they sent word to the king:
“Return, you and all your servants.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king returned, and when he arrived
at the Jordan, the men of Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort
him across the Jordan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Shimei son of Gera, a Benjamite from
Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David, along
with a thousand men of Benjamin, as well as Ziba the steward of the
house of Saul and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They rushed down to the Jordan before the
king and crossed at the ford to carry over the king’s household and
to do what was good in his sight. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Shimei son of Gera crossed the
Jordan, he fell down before the king and said, “My lord, do not
hold me guilty, and do not remember your servant’s wrongdoing on
the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king not take it to
heart. For your servant knows that I have sinned, so here I am today
as the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord
the king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Abishai son of Zeruiah said,
“Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the
LORD’s anointed?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And David replied, “Sons of Zeruiah,
what have I to do with you, that you should be my adversaries today?
Should any man be put to death in Israel today? Am I not indeed aware
that today I am king over Israel?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king said to Shimei, “You shall
not die.” And the king swore an oath to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, went
down to meet the king. He had not cared for his feet or trimmed his
mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king had left until
the day he returned safely. And he came from Jerusalem to meet the
king, who asked him, “Mephibosheth, why did you not go with me?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">My lord the king,” he replied,
“because I am lame, I said, ‘I will have my donkey saddled so
that I may ride on it and go with the king.’ But my servant Ziba
deceived me, and he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Yet my lord the king is like the angel of
God, so do what is good in your eyes. For all the house of my
grandfather deserves death from my lord the king, yet you have set
your servant among those who eat at your table. What further right,
then, do I have to keep appealing to the king?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king replied, “Why say any more? I
hereby declare that you and Ziba are to divide the land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Mephibosheth said to the king,
“Instead, since my lord the king has safely come to his own house,
let Ziba take it all!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down
from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and send him on his
way from there. Barzillai was quite old, eighty years of age, and
since he was a very wealthy man, he had provided for the king while
he stayed in Mahanaim. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over
with me, and I will provide for you at my side in Jerusalem.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Barzillai replied, “How many years
of my life remain, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king? I
am now eighty years old. Can I discern what is good and what is not?
Can your servant taste what he eats or drinks? Can I still hear the
voice of singing men and women? Why should your servant be an added
burden to my lord the king? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Your servant could go with the king only a
short distance past the Jordan; why should the king repay me with
such a reward? Please let your servant return, that I may die in my
own city near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your
servant Chimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for
him what is good in your sight.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king replied, “Chimham will cross
over with me, and I will do for him what seems good in your sight,
and I will do for you whatever you desire of me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So all the people crossed the Jordan, and
then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and blessed
him, and Barzillai returned home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king went on to Gilgal, and
Chimham crossed over with him. All the troops of Judah and half the
troops of Israel escorted the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Soon all the men of Israel came to the
king and asked, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, take you
away secretly and bring the king and his household across the Jordan,
together with all of David’s men?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And all the men of Judah replied to the
men of Israel, “We did this because the king is our relative. Why
does this anger you? Have we ever eaten at the king’s expense or
received anything for ourselves?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">We have ten shares in the king,”
answered the men of Israel, “so we have more claim to David than
you. Why then do you despise us? Were we not the first to speak of
restoring our king?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the men of Judah pressed even harder
than the men of Israel. </font>
