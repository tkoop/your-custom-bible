<font ><b>I Will Send My Messenger</b></font></p>

“<font >Behold, I will send My messenger, who
will prepare the way before Me. Then the Lord whom you seek will
suddenly come to His temple—the Messenger of the covenant, in whom
you delight—see, He is coming,” says the LORD of Hosts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But who can endure the day of His coming?
And who can stand when He appears? For He will be like a refiner’s
fire, like a launderer’s soap. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And He will sit as a refiner and purifier
of silver; He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold
and silver. Then they will present offerings to the LORD in
righteousness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem
will please the LORD, as in days of old and years gone by. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Then I will draw near to you for
judgment. And I will be a swift witness against sorcerers and
adulterers and perjurers, against oppressors of the widowed and
fatherless, and against those who defraud laborers of their wages and
deny justice to the foreigner but do not fear Me,” says the LORD of
Hosts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Because I, the LORD, do not change, you
descendants of Jacob have not been destroyed. Yet from the days of
your fathers, you have turned away from My statutes and have not kept
them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,” says the LORD of
Hosts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >But you ask, ‘How can we return?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing
Me! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But you ask, ‘How do we rob You?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In tithes and offerings. You are cursed
with a curse, yet you—the whole nation—are still robbing Me.
Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food
in My house. Test Me in this,” says the LORD of Hosts. “See if I
will not open the windows of heaven and pour out for you blessing
without measure. I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will
not destroy the fruits of your land, and the vine in your field will
not fail to produce fruit,” says the LORD of Hosts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Then all the nations will call you
blessed, for you will be a land of delight,” says the LORD of
Hosts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Your words against Me have been harsh,”
says the LORD. “Yet you ask, ‘What have we spoken against You?’
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You have said, ‘It is futile to serve
God. What have we gained by keeping His requirements and walking
mournfully before the LORD of Hosts? So now we call the arrogant
blessed. Not only do evildoers prosper, they even test God and
escape.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time those who feared the LORD
spoke with one another, and the LORD listened and heard them. So a
scroll of remembrance was written before Him regarding those who
feared the LORD and honored His name. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >They will be Mine,” says the LORD of
Hosts, “on the day when I prepare My treasured possession. And I
will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him. So you
will again distinguish between the righteous and the wicked, between
those who serve God and those who do not.” </font>
