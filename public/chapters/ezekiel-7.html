<span class="reftext">2</span>“O son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says to the land of Israel: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘The end! The end has come </p><p class="indent"> upon the four corners of the land.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>The end is now upon you, </p><p class="indent"> and I will unleash My anger against you. </p><p class="indent1"> I will judge you according to your ways </p><p class="indent"> and repay you for all your abominations.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I will not look on you with pity, </p><p class="indent"> nor will I spare you, </p><p class="indent1"> but I will punish you for your ways </p><p class="indent"> and for the abominations among you. </p><p class="indent1stline"> Then you will know that I am the LORD.’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Disaster! An unprecedented disaster<span class="fn">a</span> —</p><p class="indent"> behold, it is coming!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>The end has come! </p><p class="indent"> The end has come! </p><p class="indent1"> It has roused itself against you. </p><p class="indent"> Behold, it has come!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Doom has come to you, </p><p class="indent"> O inhabitants of the land. </p><p class="indent1"> The time has come; </p><p class="indent"> the day is near; </p><p class="indent1"> there is panic on the mountains </p><p class="indent"> instead of shouts of joy.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Very soon I will pour out My wrath upon you </p><p class="indent"> and vent My anger against you; </p><p class="indent1"> I will judge you according to your ways </p><p class="indent"> and repay you for all your abominations.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>I will not look on you with pity, </p><p class="indent"> nor will I spare you, </p><p class="indent1"> but I will punish you for your ways </p><p class="indent"> and for the abominations among you. </p><p class="indent1"> Then you will know that it is I, the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> who strikes the blow.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Behold, the day is here! </p><p class="indent"> It has come! </p><p class="indent1"> Doom has gone out, </p><p class="indent"> the rod has budded, </p><p class="indent"> arrogance has bloomed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Their violence has grown into a rod </p><p class="indent"> to punish their wickedness.<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> None of them will remain: </p><p class="indent"> none of their multitude, </p><p class="indent1"> none of their wealth, </p><p class="indent"> and nothing of value.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>The time has come; </p><p class="indent"> the day has arrived. </p><p class="indent1"> Let the buyer not rejoice </p><p class="indent"> and the seller not mourn, </p><p class="indent"> for wrath is upon the whole multitude.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>The seller will surely not recover what he sold </p><p class="indent"> while both remain alive. </p><p class="indent1"> For the vision concerning the whole multitude </p><p class="indent"> will not be revoked, </p><p class="indent1"> and because of their iniquity, </p><p class="indent"> not one of them will preserve his life.
</p><p class="hdg">The Desolation of Israel</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>They have blown the trumpet </p><p class="indent"> and made everything ready, </p><p class="indent1"> but no one goes to war, </p><p class="indent"> for My wrath is upon the whole multitude.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The sword is outside; </p><p class="indent"> plague and famine are within. </p><p class="indent1"> Those in the country will die by the sword, </p><p class="indent"> and those in the city will be devoured </p><p class="indent"> by famine and plague.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>The survivors will escape </p><p class="indent"> and live in the mountains, </p><p class="indent1"> moaning like doves of the valley, </p><p class="indent"> each for his own iniquity.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Every hand will go limp, </p><p class="indent"> and every knee will turn to water.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>They will put on sackcloth, </p><p class="indent"> and terror will overwhelm them. </p><p class="indent1"> Shame will cover all their faces, </p><p class="indent"> and all their heads will be shaved.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>They will throw their silver into the streets, </p><p class="indent"> and their gold will seem unclean. </p><p class="indent1"> Their silver and gold cannot save them </p><p class="indent"> in the day of the wrath of the LORD. </p><p class="indent1"> They cannot satisfy their appetites </p><p class="indent"> or fill their stomachs with wealth, </p><p class="indent1"> for it became the stumbling block </p><p class="indent"> that brought their iniquity.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>His beautiful ornaments </p><p class="indent"> they transformed into pride </p><p class="indent1"> and used them to fashion </p><p class="indent"> their vile images and detestable idols. </p><p class="indent1"> Therefore I will make these </p><p class="indent"> into something unclean for them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>And I will hand these things over </p><p class="indent"> as plunder to foreigners </p><p class="indent1"> and loot to the wicked of the earth, </p><p class="indent"> who will defile them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>I will turn My face away from them, </p><p class="indent"> and they will defile My treasured place. </p><p class="indent1"> Violent men will enter it, </p><p class="indent"> and they will defile it.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>Forge the chain, </p><p class="indent"> for the land is full of crimes of bloodshed, </p><p class="indent"> and the city is full of violence.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So I will bring the most wicked of nations </p><p class="indent"> to take possession of their houses. </p><p class="indent1"> I will end the pride of the mighty, </p><p class="indent"> and their holy places will be profaned.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>Anguish is coming! </p><p class="indent"> They will seek peace, but find none.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Disaster upon disaster will come, </p><p class="indent"> and rumour after rumour. </p><p class="indent1"> Then they will seek a vision from a prophet, </p><p class="indent"> but instruction from the priests will perish, </p><p class="indent"> as will counsel from the elders.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>The king will mourn, </p><p class="indent"> the prince will be clothed with despair, </p><p class="indent"> and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. </p><p class="indent1"> I will deal with them according to their conduct, </p><p class="indent"> and I will judge them by their own standards. </p><p class="indent1stline"> Then they will know that I am the LORD.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">A unique disaster</i>, as in most Hebrew manuscripts; some Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac <i class="calibre6">Disaster after disaster</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">The violence has grown into a rod of wickedness</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
