<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when the people saw that Moses was
delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron
and said, “Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this
Moses who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what
has happened to him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Aaron told them, “Take off the gold
earrings that are on your wives and sons and daughters, and bring
them to me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all the people took off their gold
earrings and brought them to Aaron. He took the gold from their
hands, and with an engraving tool he fashioned it into a molten calf.
And they said, “These, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up
out of the land of Egypt!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Aaron saw this, he built an altar
before the calf and proclaimed: “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the
LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the next day they arose, offered burnt
offerings, and presented peace offerings. And the people sat down to
eat and drink, and got up to indulge in revelry. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go down at
once, for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt,
have corrupted themselves. How quickly they have turned aside from
the way that I commanded them! They have made for themselves a molten
calf and have bowed down to it. They have sacrificed to it and said,
‘These, O Israel, are your gods, who brought you up out of the land
of Egypt.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD also said to Moses, “I have
seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people. Now
leave Me alone, so that My anger may burn against them and consume
them. Then I will make you into a great nation.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his
God, saying, “O LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people,
whom You brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a
mighty hand? Why should the Egyptians declare, ‘He brought them out
with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and wipe them from
the face of the earth’? Turn from Your fierce anger and relent from
doing harm to Your people. Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and
Israel, to whom You swore by Your very self when You declared, ‘I
will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I
will give your descendants all this land that I have promised, and it
shall be their inheritance forever.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the LORD relented from the calamity He
had threatened to bring on His people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Moses turned and went down the
mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They
were inscribed on both sides, front and back. The tablets were the
work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the
tablets. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Joshua heard the sound of the people
shouting, he said to Moses, “The sound of war is in the camp.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Moses replied: </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">It is neither the cry of victory nor

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I hear the sound of singing!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As Moses approached the camp and saw the
calf and the dancing, he burned with anger and threw the tablets out
of his hands, shattering them at the base of the mountain. Then he
took the calf they had made, burned it in the fire, ground it to
powder, and scattered the powder over the face of the water. Then he
forced the Israelites to drink it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">What did this people do to you,”
Moses asked Aaron, “that you have led them into so great a sin?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not be enraged, my lord,” Aaron
replied. “You yourself know that the people are intent on evil.
They told me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this
Moses who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what
has happened to him!’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold,
let him take it off,’ and they gave it to me. And when I threw it
into the fire, out came this calf!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moses saw that the people were out of
control, for Aaron had let them run wild and become a laughingstock
to their enemies. So Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and
said, “Whoever is for the LORD, come to me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And all the Levites gathered around him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He told them, “This is what the LORD,
the God of Israel, says: ‘Each of you men is to fasten his sword to
his side, go back and forth through the camp from gate to gate, and
slay his brother, his friend, and his neighbor.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Levites did as Moses commanded, and
that day about three thousand of the people fell dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Afterward, Moses said, “Today you have
been ordained for service to the LORD, since each man went against
his son and his brother; so the LORD has bestowed a blessing on you
this day.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The next day Moses said to the people,
“You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to the LORD;
perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Moses returned to the LORD and said,
“Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made
gods of gold for themselves. Yet now, if You would only forgive their
sin.... But if not, please blot me out of the book that You have
written.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD replied to Moses, “Whoever has
sinned against Me, I will blot out of My book. Now go, lead the
people to the place I described. Behold, My angel shall go before
you. But on the day I settle accounts, I will punish them for their
sin.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD sent a plague on the people
because of what they had done with the calf that Aaron had made. </font>
