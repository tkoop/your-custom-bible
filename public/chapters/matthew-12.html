<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Lord of the Sabbath<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Samuel 21:1–7; Mark 2:23–28; Luke 6:1–5)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat them.
<span class="reftext">2</span>When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
<span class="reftext">4</span>He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread,<span class="fn">a</span>  which was not lawful for them to eat, but only for the priests.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">5</span>Or haven’t you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and yet are innocent?
<span class="reftext">6</span>But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">7</span>If only you had known the meaning of ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’<span class="fn">b</span>  you would not have condemned the innocent.
<span class="reftext">8</span>For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals on the Sabbath<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 3:1–6; Luke 6:6–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Moving on from there, Jesus entered their synagogue,
<span class="reftext">10</span>and a man with a withered hand was there. In order to accuse Jesus, they asked Him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>He replied, <span>“If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out?
<span class="reftext">12</span>How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then Jesus said to the man, <span>“Stretch out your hand.”</span> So he stretched it out, and it was restored to full use, just like the other.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Chosen Servant<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 42:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them all,
<span class="reftext">16</span>warning them not to make Him known.
<span class="reftext">17</span>This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>“Here is My Servant, </p><p class="indent"> whom I have chosen, </p><p class="indent1"> My beloved, </p><p class="indent"> in whom My soul delights. </p><p class="indent1"> I will put My Spirit on Him, </p><p class="indent"> and He will proclaim justice to the nations.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>He will not quarrel or cry out; </p><p class="indent"> no one will hear His voice in the streets.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>A bruised reed He will not break, </p><p class="indent"> and a smouldering wick He will not extinguish, </p><p class="indent1"> till He leads justice to victory.
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">21</span>In His name the nations will put their hope.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">A House Divided<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 3:20–27; Luke 11:14–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed the man so that he could speak and see.
<span class="reftext">23</span>The crowds were astounded and asked, “Could this be the Son of David?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “Only by Beelzebul,<span class="fn">d</span>  the prince of demons, does this man drive out demons.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, <span>“Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
<span class="reftext">26</span>If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
<span class="reftext">27</span>And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.
<span class="reftext">28</span>But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">29</span>Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and steal his possessions, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">30</span>He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.
</p><p class="hdg">The Unpardonable Sin<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 3:28–30)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the one to come.
</p><p class="hdg">Good and Bad Fruit<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 6:43–45)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">33</span>Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.
<span class="reftext">34</span>You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks.
<span class="reftext">35</span>The good man brings good things out of his good store of treasure, and the evil man brings evil things out of his evil store of treasure.
<span class="reftext">36</span>But I tell you that men will give an account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.
<span class="reftext">37</span>For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Sign of Jonah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jonah 3:1–10; Luke 11:29–32)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Jesus replied, <span>“A wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
<span class="reftext">40</span>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">41</span>The men of Nineveh will stand at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now One greater than Jonah is here.
<span class="reftext">42</span>The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon is here.
</p><p class="hdg">An Unclean Spirit Returns<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 11:24–26)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">43</span>When an unclean spirit comes out of a man, it passes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.
<span class="reftext">44</span>Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I left.’ On its return, it finds the house vacant, swept clean, and put in order.
<span class="reftext">45</span>Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and dwell there; and the final plight of that man is worse than the first. So will it be with this wicked generation.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus’ Mother and Brothers<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 3:31–35; Luke 8:19–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, His mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to Him.
<span class="reftext">47</span>Someone told Him, “Look, Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to You.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>But Jesus replied, <span>“Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?”</span>
<span class="reftext">49</span>Pointing to His disciples, He said, <span>“Here are My mother and My brothers.
<span class="reftext">50</span>For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.”</span></p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Bread of the Presence</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hosea 6:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Isaiah 42:1–4 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> WH <i class="calibre6">Beezeboul</i>; Vulgate <i class="calibre6">Beelzebub</i>; also in verse 27<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">47</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> WH does not include verse 47.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
