<font ><b>The Lord of the Sabbath</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Jesus went through the
grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to
pick the heads of grain and eat them. When the Pharisees saw this,
they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is unlawful
on the Sabbath.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Have
you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the
consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to eat, but only for
the priests.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Or haven’t you
read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break
the Sabbath and yet are innocent? But I tell you that something
greater than the temple is here. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >If only you had
known the meaning of ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’ you would
not have condemned the innocent. For the Son of Man is Lord of the
Sabbath.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moving on from there, Jesus entered their
synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there. In order to
accuse Jesus, they asked Him, “Is it lawful to heal on the
Sabbath?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He replied, <font color="#a80000">“If
one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will
he not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a
man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to the man, <font color="#a80000">“Stretch
out your hand.”</font> So he stretched it out, and it was restored
to full use, just like the other. But the Pharisees went out and
plotted how they might kill Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that
place. Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them all, warning
them not to make Him known. This was to fulfill what was spoken
through the prophet Isaiah: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Here is My Servant, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >whom I have chosen, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >My beloved, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >in whom My soul delights. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will put My Spirit on Him, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and He will proclaim justice to the
nations. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He will not quarrel or cry out; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >no one will hear His voice in the streets.
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >A bruised reed He will not break, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and a smoldering wick He will not
extinguish, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >till He leads justice to victory. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >In His name the nations will put their
hope.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a demon-possessed man who was blind
and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed the man so that he could
speak and see. The crowds were astounded and asked, “Could this be
the Son of David?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when the Pharisees heard this, they
said, “Only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, does this man drive
out demons.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to
them, <font color="#a80000">“Every kingdom divided against itself
will be laid waste, and every city or household divided against
itself will not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided
against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? And if I drive out
demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then,
they will be your judges. But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of
God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Or again, how can
anyone enter a strong man’s house and steal his possessions, unless
he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >He who is not with
Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Therefore I tell
you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy
against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Whoever speaks a word
against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against
the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the
one to come. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Make a tree good and
its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad;
for a tree is known by its fruit. You brood of vipers, how can you
who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart,
the mouth speaks. The good man brings good things out of his good
store of treasure, and the evil man brings evil things out of his
evil store of treasure. But I tell you that men will give an account
on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken. For
by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be
condemned.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then some of the scribes and Pharisees
said to Him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“A
wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign, but none will be
given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For as Jonah was three
days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of
Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The men of Nineveh
will stand at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for
they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now One greater than
Jonah is here. The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with
this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the
earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and now One greater than Solomon
is here. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >When an unclean
spirit comes out of a man, it passes through arid places seeking rest
and does not find it. Then it says, ‘I will return to the house I
left.’ On its return, it finds the house vacant, swept clean, and
put in order. Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits
more wicked than itself, and they go in and dwell there; and the
final plight of that man is worse than the first. So will it be with
this wicked generation.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Jesus was still speaking to the
crowds, His mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to
Him. Someone told Him, “Look, Your mother and brothers are standing
outside, wanting to speak to You.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Who
is My mother, and who are My brothers?”</font> Pointing to His
disciples, He said, <font color="#a80000">“Here are My mother and
My brothers. For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My
brother and sister and mother.”</font> </font>
