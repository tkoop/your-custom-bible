<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Jesus went through the
grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to
pick the heads of grain and eat them. When the Pharisees saw this,
they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is unlawful
on the Sabbath.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Have
you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the
consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to eat, but only for
the priests.</font> </font>

the Sabbath and yet are innocent? But I tell you that something

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moving on from there, Jesus entered their
synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there. In order to
accuse Jesus, they asked Him, “Is it lawful to heal on the
Sabbath?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He replied, <font color="#a80000">“If
one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will
he not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a
man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”</font>

out your hand.”</font> So he stretched it out, and it was restored
to full use, just like the other. But the Pharisees went out and
plotted how they might kill Jesus. </font>

they will be your judges. But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of
God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</font> </font>

the mouth speaks. The good man brings good things out of his good
