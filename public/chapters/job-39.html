</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Can you count the months they are pregnant? </p><p class="indent"> Do you know the time they give birth?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>They crouch down and bring forth their young; </p><p class="indent"> they deliver their newborn.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Their young ones thrive and grow up in the open field; </p><p class="indent"> they leave and do not return.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Who set the wild donkey free? </p><p class="indent"> Who released the swift donkey from the harness?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>I made the wilderness his home </p><p class="indent"> and the salt flats his dwelling.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>He scorns the tumult of the city </p><p class="indent"> and never hears the shouts of a driver.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>He roams the mountains for pasture, </p><p class="indent"> searching for any green thing.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Will the wild ox consent to serve you? </p><p class="indent"> Will he stay by your manger at night?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? </p><p class="indent"> Will he plow the valleys behind you?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Can you rely on his great strength? </p><p class="indent"> Will you leave your hard work to him?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Can you trust him to bring in your grain </p><p class="indent"> and gather it to your threshing floor?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, </p><p class="indent"> but cannot match the pinions<span class="fn">a</span>  and feathers of the stork.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>For she leaves her eggs on the ground </p><p class="indent"> and lets them warm in the sand.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>She forgets that a foot may crush them, </p><p class="indent"> or a wild animal may trample them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>She treats her young harshly, as if not her own, </p><p class="indent"> with no concern that her labour was in vain.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>For God has deprived her of wisdom; </p><p class="indent"> He has not endowed her with understanding.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Yet when she proudly spreads her wings, </p><p class="indent"> she laughs at the horse and its rider.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>Do you give strength to the horse </p><p class="indent"> or adorn his neck with a mane?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Do you make him leap like a locust, </p><p class="indent"> striking terror with his proud snorting?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; </p><p class="indent"> he charges into battle.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>He laughs at fear, frightened of nothing; </p><p class="indent"> he does not turn back from the sword.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>A quiver rattles at his side, </p><p class="indent"> along with a flashing spear and lance.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Trembling with excitement, he devours the distance; </p><p class="indent"> he cannot stand still when the ram’s horn sounds.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>At the blast of the horn, he snorts with fervour.<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent"> He catches the scent of battle from afar—</p><p class="indent"> the shouts of captains and the cry of war.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>Does the hawk take flight by your understanding </p><p class="indent"> and spread his wings toward the south?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Does the eagle soar at your command </p><p class="indent"> and make his nest on high?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>He dwells on a cliff and lodges there; </p><p class="indent"> his stronghold is on a rocky crag.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>From there he spies out food; </p><p class="indent"> his eyes see it from afar.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>His young ones feast on blood; </p><p class="indent"> and where the slain are, there he is.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Pinions</i> are the outer parts of a bird’s wings, including the flight feathers.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">javelin</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">he snorts, ‘Aha!’</i> <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
