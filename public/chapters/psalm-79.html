</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>They have given the corpses of Your servants </p><p class="indent"> as food to the birds of the air, </p><p class="indent"> the flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>They have poured out their blood like water </p><p class="indent"> all around Jerusalem, </p><p class="indent"> and there is no one to bury the dead.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>We have become a reproach to our neighbors, </p><p class="indent"> a scorn and derision to those around us.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>How long, O LORD? </p><p class="indent"> Will You be angry forever? </p><p class="indent"> Will Your jealousy burn like fire?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Pour out Your wrath on the nations </p><p class="indent"> that do not acknowledge You, </p><p class="indent1"> on the kingdoms </p><p class="indent"> that refuse to call on Your name,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>for they have devoured Jacob </p><p class="indent"> and devastated his homeland.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Do not hold past sins against us; </p><p class="indent"> let Your compassion come quickly, </p><p class="indent"> for we are brought low.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Help us, O God of our salvation, </p><p class="indent"> for the glory of Your name; </p><p class="indent1"> deliver us and atone for our sins, </p><p class="indent"> for the sake of Your name.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Why should the nations ask, </p><p class="indent">“Where is their God?” </p><p class="indent1"> Before our eyes, make known among the nations </p><p class="indent"> Your vengeance for the bloodshed of Your servants.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>May the groans of the captives reach You; </p><p class="indent"> by the strength of Your arm preserve those condemned to death.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Pay back into the laps of our neighbors </p><p class="indent"> sevenfold the reproach they hurled at You, O Lord.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then we Your people, the sheep of Your pasture, </p><p class="indent"> will thank You forever; </p><p class="indent1"> from generation to generation </p><p class="indent"> we will declare Your praise.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
