<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “Send out
for yourself men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to
the Israelites. From each of their fathers’ tribes send one man who
is a leader among them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So at the consent of the LORD, Moses sent
them out from the Wilderness of Paran. All the men were leaders of
the Israelites, and these were their names: </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >and from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of
Machi. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These were the names of the men Moses sent
to spy out the land; and Moses gave to Hoshea son of Nun the name
Joshua. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Moses sent them to spy out the land
of Canaan, he told them, “Go up through the Negev and into the hill
country. See what the land is like and whether its people are strong
or weak, few or many. Is the land where they live good or bad? Are
the cities where they dwell open camps or fortifications? Is the soil
fertile or unproductive? Are there trees in it or not? Be courageous,
and bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season
for the first ripe grapes.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they went up and spied out the land
from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo-hamath. They
went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai,
and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, dwelled. It had been built seven
years before Zoan in Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they came to the Valley of Eshcol,
they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes, which they
carried on a pole between two men. They also took some pomegranates
and figs. Because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut there,
that place was called the Valley of Eshcol. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After forty days the men returned from
spying out the land, and they went back to Moses, Aaron, and the
whole congregation of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh.
They brought back a report for the whole congregation and showed them
the fruit of the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And they gave this account to Moses: “We
went into the land to which you sent us, and indeed, it is flowing
with milk and honey. Here is some of its fruit! Nevertheless, the
people living in the land are strong, and the cities are large and
fortified. We even saw the descendants of Anak there. The Amalekites
live in the land of the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites
live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the sea and
along the Jordan.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses
and said, “We must go up and take possession of the land, for we
can certainly conquer it!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the men who had gone up with him
replied, “We cannot go up against the people, for they are stronger
than we are!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they gave the Israelites a bad report
about the land that they had spied out: “The land we explored
devours its inhabitants, and all the people we saw there are great in
stature. We even saw the Nephilim there—the descendants of Anak
that come from the Nephilim! We seemed like grasshoppers in our own
sight, and we must have seemed the same to them!” </font>
