</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“How long until <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> end these speeches? </p><p class="indent"> Show some sense, and then we can talk.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Why are we regarded as cattle, </p><p class="indent"> as stupid in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sight?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>You who tear yourself in anger—</p><p class="indent"> should the earth be forsaken on your account, </p><p class="indent"> or the rocks be moved from their place?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Indeed, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished; </p><p class="indent"> the flame of his fire does not glow.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>The light in his tent grows dark, </p><p class="indent"> and the lamp beside him goes out.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>His vigorous stride is shortened, </p><p class="indent"> and his own schemes trip him up.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>For his own feet lead him into a net, </p><p class="indent"> and he wanders into its mesh.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>A trap seizes his heel; </p><p class="indent"> a snare grips him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>A noose is hidden in the ground, </p><p class="indent"> and a trap lies in his path.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Terrors frighten him on every side </p><p class="indent"> and harass his every step.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>His strength is depleted, </p><p class="indent"> and calamity is ready at his side.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>It devours patches of his skin; </p><p class="indent"> the firstborn of death devours his limbs.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>He is torn from the shelter of his tent </p><p class="indent"> and is marched off to the king of terrors.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Fire resides in his tent; </p><p class="indent"> burning <span class='spell ca'>sulphur</span><span class='spell gb'>sulphur</span><span class='spell us'>sulfur</span> rains down on his dwelling.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>The roots beneath him dry up, </p><p class="indent"> and the branches above him wither away.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>The memory of him perishes from the earth, </p><p class="indent"> and he has no name in the land.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>He is driven from light into darkness </p><p class="indent"> and is chased from the inhabited world.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>He has no offspring or posterity among his people, </p><p class="indent"> no survivor where he once lived.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Those in the west are appalled at his fate, </p><p class="indent"> while those in the east tremble in horror.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Surely such is the dwelling of the wicked </p><p class="indent"> and the place of one who does not know God.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
