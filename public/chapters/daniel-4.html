<font >I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house
and flourishing in my palace. I had a dream, and it frightened me;
while in my bed, the images and visions in my mind alarmed me. So I
issued a decree that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me
to interpret the dream for me. When the magicians, enchanters,
astrologers, and diviners came in, I told them the dream, and they
could not interpret it for me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But at last, into my presence came Daniel
(whose name is Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is
the spirit of the holy gods). And I told him the dream: “O
Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the
holy gods is in you and that no mystery baffles you. So explain to me
the visions I saw in my dream, and their interpretation. In these
visions of my mind as I was lying in bed, I saw this come to pass: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >There was a tree in the midst of the land,
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and its height was great. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >The tree grew large and strong; </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As I lay on my bed, I also saw in the
visions of my mind a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven. He
called out in a loud voice: </font>

<font >This is the dream that I, King
Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation,

But you are able, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For a time, Daniel, who was also known as
Belteshazzar, was perplexed, and his thoughts alarmed him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king said, “Belteshazzar, do not
let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >My lord,” replied Belteshazzar, “may
the dream apply to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your
enemies! </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The tree you saw that grew large and
strong, whose top reached the sky and was visible to all the earth,

For you have become great and strong; your greatness has grown to
reach the sky, and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you, O king, saw a watcher, a holy

‘<font >Cut down the tree and destroy it, </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the interpretation, O king, and
this is the decree that the Most High has issued against my lord the
king: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You will be driven away from mankind, and
your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field. You will feed on
grass like an ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven, and seven
times shall pass you by, until you acknowledge that the Most High
rules over the kingdom of mankind and gives it to whom He wishes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the command to leave the stump of
the tree with its roots, your kingdom will be restored to you as soon
as you acknowledge that Heaven rules. Therefore, may my advice be
pleasing to you, O king. Break away from your sins by doing what is
right, and from your iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed.
Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
Twelve months later, as he was walking on the roof of the royal
palace of Babylon, the king exclaimed, “Is this not Babylon the
Great, which I myself have built by the might of my power as a royal
residence and for the glory of my majesty?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While the words were still in the king’s
mouth, a voice came from heaven: “It is decreed to you, King
Nebuchadnezzar, that the kingdom has departed from you. You will be
driven away from mankind to live with the beasts of the field, and
you will feed on grass like an ox. And seven times will pass you by,
until you acknowledge that the Most High rules over the kingdom of
mankind and gives it to whom He wishes.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that moment the sentence against
Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from mankind. He ate
grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven,
until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like
the claws of a bird. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But at the end of those days I,
Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity was restored to
me. Then I praised the Most High, and I honored and glorified Him who
lives forever: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >For His dominion is an everlasting
dominion, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >All the peoples of the earth </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >are counted as nothing, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and He does as He pleases </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >with the army of heaven </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and the peoples of the earth. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >There is no one who can restrain His hand </font>

</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At the same time my sanity was restored,
my honor and splendor returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My
advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne,
and surpassing greatness was added to me. Now I, Nebuchadnezzar,
praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, for all His works
are true and all His ways are just. And He is able to humble those
who walk in pride. </font>
