“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now this is what you are to do to
consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve Me as priests: Take a young
bull and two rams without blemish, along with unleavened bread,
unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with
oil. Make them out of fine wheat flour, put them in a basket, and
present them in the basket, along with the bull and the two rams. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then present Aaron and his sons at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water. Take the
garments and clothe Aaron with the tunic, the robe of the ephod, the
ephod itself, and the breastplate. Fasten the ephod on him with its
woven waistband. Put the turban on his head and attach the holy
diadem to the turban. Then take the anointing oil and anoint him by
pouring it on his head. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Present his sons as well and clothe them
with tunics. Wrap the sashes around Aaron and his sons and tie
headbands on them. The priesthood shall be theirs by a permanent
statute. In this way you are to ordain Aaron and his sons. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You are to present the bull at the front
of the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron and his sons are to lay their hands
on its head. And you shall slaughter the bull before the LORD at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Take some of the blood of the bull
and put it on the horns of the altar with your finger; then pour out
the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. Take all the fat that
covers the entrails and the lobe of the liver, and both kidneys with
the fat on them, and burn them on the altar. But burn the flesh of
the bull and its hide and dung outside the camp; it is a sin
offering. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Take one of the rams, and Aaron and his
sons shall lay their hands on its head. You are to slaughter the ram,
take its blood, and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar. Cut the
ram into pieces, wash the entrails and legs, and place them with its
head and other pieces. Then burn the entire ram on the altar; it is a
burnt offering to the LORD, a pleasing aroma, an offering made by
fire to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Take the second ram, and Aaron and his
sons are to lay their hands on its head. Slaughter the ram, take some
of its blood, and put it on the right earlobes of Aaron and his sons,
on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their
right feet. Sprinkle the remaining blood on all sides of the altar.
And take some of the blood on the altar and some of the anointing oil
and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments, as well as on his sons and
their garments. Then he and his garments will be consecrated, as well
as his sons and their garments. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Take the fat from the ram, the fat tail,
the fat covering the entrails, the lobe of the liver, both kidneys
with the fat on them, and the right thigh (since this is a ram for
ordination), along with one loaf of bread, one cake of bread made
with oil, and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread that is
before the LORD. Put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and
wave them before the LORD as a wave offering. Then take them from
their hands and burn them on the altar atop the burnt offering as a
pleasing aroma before the LORD; it is an offering made by fire to the
LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s
ordination and wave it before the LORD as a wave offering, and it
will be your portion. Consecrate for Aaron and his sons the breast of
the wave offering that is waved and the thigh of the heave offering
that is lifted up from the ram of ordination. This will belong to
Aaron and his sons as a regular portion from the Israelites, for it
is the heave offering the Israelites will make to the LORD from their
peace offerings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The holy garments that belong to Aaron
will belong to his sons after him, so they can be anointed and
ordained in them. The son who succeeds him as priest and enters the
Tent of Meeting to minister in the Holy Place must wear them for
seven days. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You are to take the ram of ordination and
boil its flesh in a holy place. At the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting, Aaron and his sons are to eat the meat of the ram and the
bread that is in the basket. They must eat those things by which
atonement was made for their ordination and consecration. But no
outsider may eat them, because these things are sacred. And if any of
the meat of ordination or any bread is left until the morning, you
are to burn up the remainder. It must not be eaten, because it is
sacred. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what you are to do for Aaron and
his sons based on all that I have commanded you, taking seven days to
ordain them. Sacrifice a bull as a sin offering each day for
atonement. Purify the altar by making atonement for it, and anoint it
to consecrate it. For seven days you shall make atonement for the
altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will become most holy;
whatever touches the altar will be holy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what you are to offer regularly on
the altar, each day: two lambs that are a year old. Offer one lamb in
the morning and the other at twilight. With the first lamb offer a
tenth of an ephah of fine flour, mixed with a quarter hin of oil from
pressed olives, and a drink offering of a quarter hin of wine. And
offer the second lamb at twilight with the same grain offering and
drink offering as in the morning, as a pleasing aroma, an offering
made by fire to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the generations to come, this burnt
offering shall be made regularly at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting before the LORD, where I will meet you to speak with you. I
will also meet with the Israelites there, and that place will be
consecrated by My glory. So I will consecrate the Tent of Meeting and
the altar, and I will consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve Me as
priests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I will dwell among the Israelites and
be their God. And they will know that I am the LORD their God, who
brought them out of the land of Egypt so that I might dwell among
them. </font>
