<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Disaster Predicted</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“You must not marry or have sons or daughters in this place.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says concerning the sons and daughters born in this place, and the mothers who bore them, and the fathers who fathered them in this land:
<span class="reftext">4</span>“They will die from deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried, but will lie like dung on the ground. They will be finished off by sword and famine, and their corpses will become food for the birds of the air and beasts of the earth.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Indeed, this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: “Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal. Do not go to mourn or show sympathy, for I have removed from this people <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> peace, <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> loving devotion, and <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> compassion,” declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>“Both great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, nor will anyone cut himself or shave his head for them.
<span class="reftext">7</span>No food will be offered to comfort those who mourn the dead; not even a cup of consolation will be given for the loss of a father or mother.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>You must not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down with them to eat and drink.
<span class="reftext">9</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am going to remove from this place, before <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> very eyes and in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> days, the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>When you tell these people all these things, they will ask you, ‘Why has <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> pronounced all this great disaster against us? What is our guilt? What is the sin that we have committed against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God?’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then you are to answer them: ‘It is because <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers have forsaken <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and followed other gods, and served and worshiped them. They abandoned <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and did not keep <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> instruction.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have done more evil than <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers. See how each of you follows the stubbornness of his evil heart instead of obeying <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
<span class="reftext">13</span>So I will cast <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> out of this land into a land that neither <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> nor <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers have known. There <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will serve other gods day and night, for I will show <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> no <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span>.’
</p><p class="hdg">God Will Restore Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Yet behold, the days are coming, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, when they will no longer say, ‘As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of Egypt.’
<span class="reftext">15</span>Instead they will say, ‘As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and all the other lands to which <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had banished them.’ For I will return them to their land that I gave to their forefathers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But for now I will send for many fishermen, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill, even from the clefts of the rocks.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>For <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> eyes are on all their ways. They are not hidden from <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> face, and their guilt is not concealed from <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> eyes.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And I will first repay them double their iniquity and their sin, because they have defiled <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> land with the carcasses of their detestable idols, and they have filled <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> inheritance with their abominations.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, my strength and my fortress, </p><p class="indent"> my refuge in the day of distress, </p><p class="indent1"> the nations will come to <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> </p><p class="indent"> from the ends of the earth, and they will say, </p><p class="indent1">“Our fathers inherited nothing but lies, </p><p class="indent"> worthless idols of no benefit at all.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Can man make gods for himself? </p><p class="indent"> Such are not gods!”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>“Therefore behold, I will inform them, </p><p class="indent"> and this time I will make them know </p><p class="indent"> My power and <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> might; </p><p class="indent1"> then they will know </p><p class="indent"> that <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
