<font><font face="Tahoma, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt"><b>Jeremiah
16</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Disaster Predicted</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “You must not marry or have sons or daughters in this
place.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For this is what the LORD says concerning
the sons and daughters born in this place, and the mothers who bore
them, and the fathers who fathered them in this land: “They will
die from deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried, but
will lie like dung on the ground. They will be finished off by sword
and famine, and their corpses will become food for the birds of the
air and beasts of the earth.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Indeed, this is what the LORD says: “Do
not enter a house where there is a funeral meal. Do not go to mourn
or show sympathy, for I have removed from this people My peace, My
loving devotion, and My compassion,” declares the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Both great and small will die in this
land. They will not be buried or mourned, nor will anyone cut himself
or shave his head for them. No food will be offered to comfort those
who mourn the dead; not even a cup of consolation will be given for
the loss of a father or mother. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You must not enter a house where there is
feasting and sit down with them to eat and drink. For this is what
the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am going to remove from
this place, before your very eyes and in your days, the sounds of joy
and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When you tell these people all these
things, they will ask you, ‘Why has the LORD pronounced all this
great disaster against us? What is our guilt? What is the sin that we
have committed against the LORD our God?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then you are to answer them: ‘It is
because your fathers have forsaken Me, declares the LORD, and
followed other gods, and served and worshiped them. They abandoned Me
and did not keep My instruction. And you have done more evil than
your fathers. See how each of you follows the stubbornness of his
evil heart instead of obeying Me. So I will cast you out of this land
into a land that neither you nor your fathers have known. There you
will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Yet behold, the days are coming, declares
the LORD, when they will no longer say, ‘As surely as the LORD
lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of Egypt.’
Instead they will say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought
the Israelites up out of the land of the north and all the other
lands to which He had banished them.’ For I will return them to
their land that I gave to their forefathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But for now I will send for many
fishermen, declares the LORD, and they will catch them. After that I
will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every
mountain and hill, even from the clefts of the rocks. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For My eyes are on all their ways. They
are not hidden from My face, and their guilt is not concealed from My
eyes. And I will first repay them double their iniquity and their
sin, because they have defiled My land with the carcasses of their
detestable idols, and they have filled My inheritance with their
abominations.” </font>
