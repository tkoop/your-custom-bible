<font ><b>David Instructs Solomon</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the time drew near for David to die, he
charged his son Solomon, “I am about to go the way of all the
earth. So be strong and prove yourself a man. And keep the charge of
the LORD your God to walk in His ways and to keep His statutes,
commandments, ordinances, and decrees, as is written in the Law of
Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you turn,
and so that the LORD may fulfill His promise to me: ‘If your
descendants take heed to walk faithfully before Me with all their
heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of
Israel.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, you know what Joab son of
Zeruiah did to me—what he did to Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of
Jether, the two commanders of the armies of Israel. He killed them in
peacetime to avenge the blood of war. He stained with the blood of
war the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. So act
according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head go down to
Sheol in peace. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But show loving devotion to the sons of
Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your
table, because they stood by me when I fled from your brother
Absalom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Keep an eye on Shimei the son of Gera, the
Benjamite from Bahurim who is with you. He called down bitter curses
against me on the day I went to Mahanaim, but when he came down to
meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: ‘I will never
put you to the sword.’ Now therefore, do not hold him guiltless,
for you are a wise man. You know what you ought to do to him to bring
his gray head down to Sheol in blood.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David rested with his fathers and was
buried in the City of David. The length of David’s reign over
Israel was forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years
in Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Solomon sat on the throne of his father
David, and his kingdom was firmly established. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Adonijah son of Haggith went to
Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, and she asked, “Do you come in
peace?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Yes, in peace,” he replied. Then he
said, “I have something to tell you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Say it,” she answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >You know that the kingship was mine,”
he said. “All Israel expected that I should reign, but the kingship
has turned to my brother, for it has come to him from the LORD. So
now I have just one request of you; do not deny me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >State your request,” she told him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Adonijah replied, “Please speak to King
Solomon, since he will not turn you down. Let him give me Abishag the
Shunammite as my wife.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Very well,” Bathsheba replied. “I
will speak to the king for you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak
to him for Adonijah. The king stood up to greet her, bowed to her,
and sat down on his throne. Then the king had a throne brought for
his mother, who sat down at his right hand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I have just one small request of you,”
she said. “Do not deny me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Make your request, my mother,” the
king replied, “for I will not deny you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Bathsheba said, “Let Abishag the
Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as his wife.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >King Solomon answered his mother, “Why
do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Since he is my
older brother, you might as well request the kingdom for him and for
Abiathar the priest and for Joab son of Zeruiah!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: “May
God punish me, and ever so severely, if Adonijah has not made this
request at the expense of his life. And now, as surely as the LORD
lives—the One who established me, who set me on the throne of my
father David, and who founded for me a dynasty as He promised—surely
Adonijah shall be put to death today!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So King Solomon sent the order to Benaiah
son of Jehoiada, who struck down Adonijah, and he died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king said to Abiathar the priest,
“Go back to your fields in Anathoth. Even though you deserve to
die, I will not put you to death at this time, since you carried the
ark of the Lord GOD before my father David, and you suffered through
all that my father suffered.” So Solomon banished Abiathar from the
priesthood of the LORD and thus fulfilled the word that the LORD had
spoken at Shiloh against the house of Eli. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the news reached Joab, who had
conspired with Adonijah but not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of
the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >It was reported to King Solomon: “Joab
has fled to the tent of the LORD and is now beside the altar.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada,
saying, “Go, strike him down!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD
and said to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Joab replied, “No, I will die here.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Benaiah relayed the message to the
king, saying, “This is how Joab answered me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the king replied, “Do just as he
says. Strike him down and bury him, and so remove from me and from
the house of my father the innocent blood that Joab shed. The LORD
will bring his bloodshed back upon his own head, for without the
knowledge of my father David he struck down two men more righteous
and better than he when he put to the sword Abner son of Ner,
commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of
Judah’s army. Their blood will come back upon the heads of Joab and
his descendants forever; but for David, his descendants, his house,
and his throne, there shall be peace from the LORD forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, struck
down Joab, and killed him. He was buried at his own home in the
wilderness. And the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada in Joab’s
place over the army, and he appointed Zadok the priest in Abiathar’s
place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king summoned Shimei and said to
him, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there, but
do not go anywhere else. On the day you go out and cross the Kidron
Valley, know for sure that you will die; your blood will be on your
own head.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >The sentence is fair,” Shimei
replied. “Your servant will do as my lord the king has spoken.”
And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After three years, however, two of
Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath. And
Shimei was told, “Look, your slaves are in Gath.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Shimei saddled his donkey and set out
to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves, and he brought them back
from Gath. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone
from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, the king summoned Shimei and
said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you,
‘On the day you leave and go elsewhere, know for sure that you will
die’? And you told me, ‘The sentence is fair; I will comply.’
So why have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the command that I
gave you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The king also said, “You know in your
heart all the evil that you did to my father David. Therefore the
LORD will bring your evil back upon your head. But King Solomon will
be blessed and David’s throne will remain secure before the LORD
forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king commanded Benaiah son of
Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down, and he died. Thus
the kingdom was firmly established in the hand of Solomon. </font>
