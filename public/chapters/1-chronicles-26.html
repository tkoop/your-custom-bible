</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,
<span class="reftext">3</span>Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, and Eliehoenai the seventh.

<span class="reftext">5</span>Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, and Peullethai the eighth. For God had blessed Obed-edom.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Also to his son Shemaiah were born sons who ruled over their families because they were strong, capable men.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Shemaiah’s sons were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad; his brothers were Elihu and Semachiah, also capable men.
<span class="reftext">8</span>All these were descendants of Obed-edom; they and their sons and brothers were capable men with strength to do the work—62 in all from Obed-edom.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Meshelemiah also had sons and brothers who were capable men—18 in all.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Hosah the Merarite also had sons: Shimri the first (although he was not the firstborn, his father had appointed him as the first),
<span class="reftext">11</span>Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth. The sons and brothers of Hosah numbered 13 in all.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>These divisions of the gatekeepers, through their chief men, had duties for ministering in the house of the LORD, just as their brothers did.
<span class="reftext">13</span>They cast lots for each gate, according to their families, young and old alike.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>The lot for the East Gate fell to Shelemiah.<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="list1stline"> Then lots were cast for his son Zechariah, a wise counsellor, and the lot for the North Gate fell to him.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>The lot for the South Gate fell to Obed-edom, and the lot for the storehouses to his sons.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>The lots for the West Gate and the Shallecheth Gate on the ascending highway<span class="fn">b</span>  fell to Shuppim and Hosah. </p><p class="reg1"> There were guards stationed at every watch.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Each day there were six Levites on the east, four on the north, four on the south, and two pairs at the storehouse.
<span class="reftext">18</span>As for the court<span class="fn">c</span>  on the west, there were four at the highway and two at the court.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>These were the divisions of the gatekeepers who were descendants of Korah and Merari.
</p><p class="hdg">The Treasurers, Officers, and Judges</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now their fellow Levites were<span class="fn">d</span>  in charge of the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries of the dedicated things.
<span class="reftext">21</span>From the descendants of Ladan, who were Gershonites through Ladan<span class="fn">e</span>  and heads of the families of Ladan the Gershonite, were Jehieli,<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">22</span>the sons of Jehieli, Zetham, and his brother Joel. They were in charge of the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>From the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>Shebuel, a descendant of Gershom son of Moses, was the officer in charge of the treasuries.
<span class="reftext">25</span>His relatives through Eliezer included Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah<span class="fn">g</span>  his son, Joram his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.
<span class="reftext">26</span>This Shelomith and his brothers were in charge of all the treasuries for the things dedicated by King David, by the heads of families who were the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and by the army commanders.
<span class="reftext">27</span>They had dedicated some of the plunder from their battles to the repair of the house of the LORD.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Everything that had been dedicated by Samuel the seer, Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner, and Joab son of Zeruiah, along with everything else that was dedicated, was under the care of Shelomith and his brothers.

<span class="reftext">31</span>As for the Hebronites, Jerijah<span class="fn">i</span>  was the chief of the Hebronites, according to the genealogies of his ancestors. In the fortieth year of David’s reign the records were searched, and strong, capable men were found among the Hebronites at Jazer in Gilead.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Among Jerijah’s relatives there were 2,700 capable men who were heads of families. King David appointed them over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh for every matter pertaining to God and to the affairs of the king.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Shelemiah</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Meshelemiah</i>; see verse 2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">on the upper road</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">parbar</i>; twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">As for the Levites, Ahijah was</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Ladan</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Libni</i>; see 1 Chronicles 6:17.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">Jehieli</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jehiel</i>; also in verse 22; see 1 Chronicles 23:8.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">Jeshaiah</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Isshiah</i>; see 1 Chronicles 24:21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">29</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the duties outside (the temple)</i> or <i class="calibre6">the duties outside (Jerusalem)</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> <i class="calibre6">Jerijah</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jeriah</i>; see 1 Chronicles 23:19.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
