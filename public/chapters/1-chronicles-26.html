who ruled over their families because they were strong, capable men.
Shemaiah’s sons were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad; his

descendants of Obed-edom; they and their sons and brothers were
capable men with strength to do the work—62 in all from Obed-edom. </font>

<font >These divisions of the gatekeepers,
through their chief men, had duties for ministering in the house of
the LORD, just as their brothers did. They cast lots for each gate,

<font >Now their fellow Levites were in charge of
the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries of the
dedicated things. From the descendants of Ladan, who were Gershonites

<font >Shebuel, a descendant of Gershom son of
Moses, was the officer in charge of the treasuries. His relatives
through Eliezer included Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram
his son, Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son. This Shelomith and
his brothers were in charge of all the treasuries for the things
dedicated by King David, by the heads of families who were the
commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and by the army commanders.
They had dedicated some of the plunder from their battles to the
repair of the house of the LORD. Everything that had been dedicated
by Samuel the seer, Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner, and Joab son
of Zeruiah, along with everything else that was dedicated, was under
the care of Shelomith and his brothers. </font>

relatives, 1,700 capable men, had charge of the affairs of Israel
west of the Jordan for all the work of the LORD and for the service
of the king. As for the Hebronites, Jerijah was the chief of the
Hebronites, according to the genealogies of his ancestors. In the
fortieth year of David’s reign the records were searched, and
strong, capable men were found among the Hebronites at Jazer in
Gilead. Among Jerijah’s relatives there were 2,700 capable men who
were heads of families. King David appointed them over the
Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh for every
matter pertaining to God and to the affairs of the king. </font>
