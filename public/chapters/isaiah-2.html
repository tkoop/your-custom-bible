<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Mountain of the House of the LORD<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Micah 4:1–5)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is the message that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>In the last days the mountain of the house of the LORD </p><p class="indent"> will be established as the chief of the mountains; </p><p class="indent1"> it will be raised above the hills, </p><p class="indent"> and all nations will stream to it.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>And many peoples will come and say: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> to the house of the God of Jacob. </p><p class="indent1"> He will teach us His ways </p><p class="indent"> so that we may walk in His paths.” </p><p class="indent1stline"> For the law will go forth from Zion, </p><p class="indent"> and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then He will judge between the nations </p><p class="indent"> and arbitrate for many peoples. </p><p class="indent1"> They will beat their swords into plowshares </p><p class="indent"> and their spears into pruning hooks. </p><p class="indent1"> Nation will no longer take up the sword against nation, </p><p class="indent"> nor train anymore for war.
</p><p class="hdg">The Day of Reckoning</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Come, O house of Jacob, </p><p class="indent"> let us walk in the light of the LORD.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For You have abandoned Your people, </p><p class="indent"> the house of Jacob, </p><p class="indent1"> because they are filled </p><p class="indent"> with influences from the east; </p><p class="indent1"> they are soothsayers like the Philistines; </p><p class="indent"> they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>Their land is full of silver and gold, </p><p class="indent"> with no limit to their treasures; </p><p class="indent1"> their land is full of horses, </p><p class="indent"> with no limit to their chariots.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Their land is full of idols; </p><p class="indent"> they bow down to the work of their hands, </p><p class="indent"> to what their fingers have made.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So mankind is brought low, </p><p class="indent"> and man is humbled—</p><p class="indent"> do not forgive them!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Go into the rocks </p><p class="indent"> and hide in the dust </p><p class="indent1"> from the terror of the LORD </p><p class="indent"> and the splendour of His majesty.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The proud look of man will be humbled, </p><p class="indent"> and the loftiness of men brought low; </p><p class="indent"> the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>For the Day of the LORD of Hosts </p><p class="indent"> will come against all the proud and lofty, </p><p class="indent1"> against all that is exalted—</p><p class="indent"> it will be humbled—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up, </p><p class="indent"> against all the oaks of Bashan,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>against all the tall mountains, </p><p class="indent"> against all the high hills,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>against every high tower, </p><p class="indent"> against every fortified wall,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>against every ship of Tarshish,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and against every stately vessel.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>So the pride of man will be brought low, </p><p class="indent"> and the loftiness of men will be humbled; </p><p class="indent1"> the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">18</span>and the idols will vanish completely.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Men will flee to caves in the rocks </p><p class="indent"> and holes in the ground, </p><p class="indent1"> away from the terror of the LORD </p><p class="indent"> and from the splendour of His majesty, </p><p class="indent"> when He rises to shake the earth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>In that day men will cast away </p><p class="indent"> to the moles and bats </p><p class="indent1"> their idols of silver and gold—</p><p class="indent"> the idols they made to worship.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>They will flee to caverns in the rocks </p><p class="indent"> and crevices in the cliffs, </p><p class="indent1"> away from the terror of the LORD </p><p class="indent"> and from the splendour of His majesty, </p><p class="indent"> when He rises to shake the earth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>Put no more trust in man, </p><p class="indent"> who has only the breath in his nostrils. </p><p class="indent"> Of what account is he?</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">every ship of trade</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
