<font >I charge you in the presence of God and of
Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of
His appearing and His kingdom: Preach the word; be prepared in season
and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and encourage with every form of
patient instruction. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the time will come when men will not
tolerate sound doctrine, but with itching ears they will gather
around themselves teachers to suit their own desires. So they will
turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But you, be sober in all things, endure
hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. For I
am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time of my
departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished
the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is laid up for me
the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will
award to me on that dayâ€”and not only to me, but to all who crave
His appearing. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make every effort to come to me quickly,
because Demas, in his love of this world, has deserted me and gone to
Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is
useful to me in the ministry. Tychicus, however, I have sent to
Ephesus. When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at
Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments. </font>

<font >Alexander the coppersmith did great harm
to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds. You too should
beware of him, for he has vigorously opposed our message. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At my first defense, no one stood with me,
but everyone deserted me. May it not be charged against them. But the
Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message
would be fully proclaimed, and all the Gentiles would hear it. So I
was delivered from the mouth of the lion. And the Lord will rescue me
from every evil action and bring me safely into His heavenly kingdom.
To Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. </font>
