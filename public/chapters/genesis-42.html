<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Joseph’s Brothers Sent to Egypt</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> staring at one another?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Look,” he added, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
<span class="reftext">4</span>But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he said, “I am afraid that harm might befall him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So the sons of Israel were among those who came to buy grain, since the famine had also spread to the land of Canaan.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Now Joseph was the ruler of the land; he was the one who sold grain to all its people. So when his brothers arrived, they bowed down before him with their faces to the ground.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And when Joseph saw his brothers, he <span class='spell ca'>recognized</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognized</span> them, but he treated them as strangers and spoke harshly to them. “Where have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> come from?” he asked. </p><p class="reg1">“From the land of Canaan,” they replied. “We are here to buy food.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Although Joseph <span class='spell ca'>recognized</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognized</span> his brothers, they did not <span class='spell ca'>recognize</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognize</span> him.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Joseph remembered his dreams about them and said, “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are spies! <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have come to see if our land is vulnerable.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>“Not so, my lord,” they replied. “Your servants have come to buy food.
<span class="reftext">11</span>We are all sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“No,” he told them. “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have come to see if our land is vulnerable.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But they answered, “Your servants are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then Joseph declared, “Just as I said, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are spies!
<span class="reftext">15</span>And this is how <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Send one of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> number to get your brother; the rest of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be confined so that the truth of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> words may be tested. If they are untrue, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are spies!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So Joseph imprisoned them for three days,
<span class="reftext">18</span>and on the third day he said to them, “I fear God. So do this and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will live:
<span class="reftext">19</span>If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are honest, leave one of your brothers in custody while the rest of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> go and take back grain to relieve the hunger of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> households.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Then bring your youngest brother to me so that <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> words can be verified, that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may not die.” </p><p class="reg1"> And to this they consented.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then they said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw his anguish when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen. That is why this distress has come upon us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And Reuben responded, “Didn’t I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not to sin against the boy? But <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> would not listen. Now we must account for his blood!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>They did not <span class='spell ca'>realize</span><span class='spell gb'>realise</span><span class='spell us'>realize</span> that Joseph understood them, since there was an interpreter between them.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And he turned away from them and wept. When he turned back and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and had him bound before their eyes.
</p><p class="hdg">Joseph’s Brothers Return to Canaan</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to return each man’s silver<span class="fn">a</span>  to his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. This order was carried out,
<span class="reftext">26</span>and they loaded the grain on their donkeys and departed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>At the place where they lodged for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of the sack.
<span class="reftext">28</span>“My silver has been returned!” he said to his brothers. “It is here in my sack.” </p><p class="reg1"> Their hearts sank, and trembling, they turned to one another and said, “What is this that God has done to us?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>When they reached their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they described to him all that had happened to them:
<span class="reftext">30</span>“The man who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the country.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>But we told him, ‘We are honest men, not spies.
<span class="reftext">32</span>We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Then the man who is lord of the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are honest: Leave one brother with me, take food to relieve the hunger of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> households, and go.
<span class="reftext">34</span>But bring your youngest brother back to me so I will know that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> can trade in the land.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>As they began emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his bag of silver! And when they and their father saw the bags of silver, they were dismayed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Their father Jacob said to them, “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have deprived me of my sons. Joseph is gone and Simeon is no more. Now <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> want to take Benjamin. Everything is going against me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>Then Reuben said to his father, “You may kill my two sons if I fail to bring him back to you. Put him in my care, and I will return him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>But Jacob replied, “My son will not go down there with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, for his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If any harm comes to him on <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> journey, you will bring my <span class='spell ca'>grey</span><span class='spell gb'>grey</span><span class='spell us'>gray</span> hair down to Sheol in sorrow.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">money</i>; here and throughout chapters 42–44<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
