<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Sin of Nadab and Abihu<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 3:1–4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense, and offered unauthorized<span class="fn">a</span>  fire before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, contrary to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> command.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So fire came out from the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and consumed them, and they died in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> meant when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘To those who come near <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> </p><p class="indent"> I will show <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> holiness, </p><p class="indent1"> and in the sight of all the people </p><p class="indent"> I will reveal <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> glory.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1"> But Aaron remained silent.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan,<span class="fn">b</span>  sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here; carry the bodies of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary.”
<span class="reftext">5</span>So they came forward and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses had directed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hair become <span class='spell ca'>dishevelled</span><span class='spell gb'>dishevelled</span><span class='spell us'>disheveled</span><span class="fn">c</span>  and do not tear <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> garments, or else <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will die, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will be angry with the whole congregation. But <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers, the whole house of Israel, may mourn on account of the fire that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has ignited.
<span class="reftext">7</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> shall not go outside the entrance to the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span><span class='bsb'>Tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span><span class='bsb'>Meeting</span>, or <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will die, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s anointing oil is on <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.” </p><p class="reg1"> So they did as Moses instructed.
</p><p class="hdg">Restrictions for Priests</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Aaron,
<span class="reftext">9</span>“You and your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> enter the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span><span class='bsb'>Tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span><span class='bsb'>Meeting</span>, or else <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will die; this is a permanent statute for the generations to come.
<span class="reftext">10</span>You must distinguish between the holy and the common, between the clean and the unclean,
<span class="reftext">11</span>so that you may teach the Israelites all the statutes that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has given them through Moses.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering that remains from the offerings made by fire to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and eat it without leaven beside the altar, because it is most holy.
<span class="reftext">13</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your share and your sons’ share of the offerings made by fire to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>; for this is what I have been commanded.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And you and your sons and daughters may eat the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution in a ceremonially clean place, because these portions have been assigned to you and your children from the peace offerings of the sons of Israel.
<span class="reftext">15</span>They are to bring the thigh of the contribution and the breast of the wave offering, together with the fat portions of the offerings made by fire, to wave as a wave offering before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. It will belong permanently to you and your children, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has commanded.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Later, Moses searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, and asked,
<span class="reftext">17</span>“Why didn’t <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> eat the sin offering in the holy place? For it is most holy; it was given to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to take away the guilt of the congregation by making atonement for them before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Since its blood was not brought inside the holy place, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> should have eaten it in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>But Aaron replied to Moses, “Behold, this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. Since these things have happened to me, if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been acceptable in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And when Moses heard this explanation, he was satisfied.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">strange</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Elzaphan</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Elizaphan</i>; see Numbers 3:30.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Do not uncover your heads</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
