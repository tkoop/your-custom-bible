<font ><b>The Sin of Nadab and Abihu</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took
their censers, put fire in them and added incense, and offered
unauthorized fire before the LORD, contrary to His command. So fire
came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they
died in the presence of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what
the LORD meant when He said: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >To those who come near Me </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will show My holiness, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and in the sight of all the people </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will reveal My glory.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Aaron remained silent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons
of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here; carry the
bodies of your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the
sanctuary.” So they came forward and carried them, still in their
tunics, outside the camp, as Moses had directed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons
Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your hair become disheveled and do
not tear your garments, or else you will die, and the LORD will be
angry with the whole congregation. But your brothers, the whole house
of Israel, may mourn on account of the fire that the LORD has
ignited. You shall not go outside the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting, or you will die, for the LORD’s anointing oil is on you.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they did as Moses instructed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You and
your sons are not to drink wine or strong drink when you enter the
Tent of Meeting, or else you will die; this is a permanent statute
for the generations to come. You must distinguish between the holy
and the common, between the clean and the unclean, so that you may
teach the Israelites all the statutes that the LORD has given them
through Moses.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Moses said to Aaron and his remaining
sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering that remains
from the offerings made by fire to the LORD and eat it without leaven
beside the altar, because it is most holy. You shall eat it in a holy
place, because it is your share and your sons’ share of the
offerings made by fire to the LORD; for this is what I have been
commanded. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you and your sons and daughters may
eat the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution
in a ceremonially clean place, because these portions have been
assigned to you and your children from the peace offerings of the
sons of Israel. They are to bring the thigh of the contribution and
the breast of the wave offering, together with the fat portions of
the offerings made by fire, to wave as a wave offering before the
LORD. It will belong permanently to you and your children, as the
LORD has commanded.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Later, Moses searched carefully for the
goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned up. He was
angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, and asked,
“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the holy place? For it is
most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the
congregation by making atonement for them before the LORD. Since its
blood was not brought inside the holy place, you should have eaten it
in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Aaron replied to Moses, “Behold,
this very day they presented their sin offering and their burnt
offering before the LORD. Since these things have happened to me, if
I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been acceptable in
the sight of the LORD?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when Moses heard this explanation, he
was satisfied. </font>
