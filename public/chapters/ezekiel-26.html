<font ><b>A Prophecy against Tyre</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the eleventh month of the twelfth year,
on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, because Tyre has said of Jerusalem, ‘Aha!
The gate to the nations is broken; it has swung open to me; now that
she lies in ruins I will be filled,’ therefore this is what the
Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, O Tyre, I am against you, and I will raise
up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves. They
will destroy the walls of Tyre and demolish her towers. I will scrape
the soil from her and make her a bare rock. She will become a place
to spread nets in the sea, for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.
She will become plunder for the nations, and the villages on her
mainland will be slain by the sword. Then they will know that I am
the LORD.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this is what the Lord GOD says:
‘Behold, I will bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, with
cavalry and a great company of troops. He will slaughter the villages
of your mainland with the sword; he will set up siege works against
you, build a ramp to your walls, and raise his shields against you.
He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and
tear down your towers with his axes. His multitude of horses will
cover you in their dust. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When he enters your gates as an army
entering a breached city, your walls will shake from the noise of
cavalry, wagons, and chariots. The hooves of his horses will trample
all your streets. He will slaughter your people with the sword, and
your mighty pillars will fall to the ground. They will plunder your
wealth and pillage your merchandise. They will demolish your walls,
tear down your beautiful homes, and throw your stones and timber and
soil into the water. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I will silence the sound of your songs,
and the music of your lyres will no longer be heard. I will make you
a bare rock, and you will become a place to spread the fishing nets.
You will never be rebuilt, for I, the LORD, have spoken, declares the
Lord GOD.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the Lord GOD says to Tyre:
‘Will not the coastlands quake at the sound of your downfall, when
the wounded groan at the slaughter in your midst? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All the princes of the sea will descend
from their thrones, remove their robes, and strip off their
embroidered garments. Clothed with terror, they will sit on the
ground, trembling every moment, appalled over you. Then they will
lament for you, saying, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >How you have perished, O city of renown

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >inhabited by seafaring men—</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >she who was powerful on the sea, along

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >who imposed terror on all peoples! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Now the coastlands tremble </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘When
I make you a desolate city like other deserted cities, and when I
raise up the deep against you so that the mighty waters cover you,
then I will bring you down with those who descend to the Pit, to the
people of antiquity. I will make you dwell in the earth below like
the ancient ruins, with those who descend to the Pit, so that you
will no longer be inhabited or set in splendor in the land of the
living. I will make you an object of horror, and you will be no more.
You will be sought, but will never be found,’ declares the Lord
GOD.” </font>
