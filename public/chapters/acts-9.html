He approached the high priest
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a><span class="reftext">2</span>and requested letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way, he could bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>As Saul drew near to Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a><span class="reftext">4</span>He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, <span>“Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>“Who are You, Lord?” Saul asked. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,”</span> He replied.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">a</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a><span><span class="reftext">6</span>“Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless. They heard the voice but did not see anyone.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a><span class="reftext">8</span>Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could not see a thing.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">b</a></span>  So they led him by the hand into Damascus.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a><span class="reftext">9</span>For three days he was without sight, and he did not eat or drink anything.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a></p><p class="hdg">Ananias Baptizes Saul</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, <span>“Ananias!”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“Here I am, Lord,” he answered.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">11</span>“Get up!”</span> the Lord told him. <span>“Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a><span class="reftext">12</span>In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But Ananias answered, “Lord, many people have told me about this man and all the harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a><span class="reftext">14</span>And now he is here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on Your name.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">15</span>“Go!”</span> said the Lord. <span>“This man is My chosen instrument to carry My name before the Gentiles and their kings, and before the people of Israel.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a><span class="reftext">16</span>I will show him how much he must suffer for My name.”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So Ananias went to the house, and when he arrived, he placed his hands on Saul. “Brother Saul,” he said, “the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>At that instant, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and his sight was restored. He got up and was baptized,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a><span class="reftext">19</span>and after taking some food, he regained his strength. And he spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="21"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>All who heard him were astounded and asked, “Isn’t this the man who wreaked havoc in Jerusalem on those who call on this name?

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But Saul was empowered all the more, and he confounded the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a><span class="reftext">25</span>One night, however, his disciples took him and lowered him in a basket through a window in the wall.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">c</a></span>

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="27"></a><span class="reftext">27</span>Then Barnabas brought him to the apostles and described how Saul had seen the Lord, who spoke to him on the road to Damascus, and how Saul had spoken boldly in that city in the name of Jesus.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="28"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>So Saul stayed with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="29"></a><span class="reftext">29</span>He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews,<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">d</a></span>  but they tried to kill him.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="30"></a><span class="reftext">30</span>When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="31"></a></p><p class="hdg">The Healing of Aeneas</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria experienced a time of peace.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="32"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>As Peter traveled throughout the area, he went to visit the saints in Lydda.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="33"></a><span class="reftext">33</span>There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="34"></a><span class="reftext">34</span>“Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ heals you! Get up and put away your mat.” Immediately Aeneas got up,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="35"></a><span class="reftext">35</span>and all who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="37"></a><span class="reftext">37</span>At that time, however, she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upper room.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="38"></a><span class="reftext">38</span>Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there and sent two men to urge him, “Come to us without delay.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="39"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>So Peter got up and went with them. On his arrival, they took him to the upper room.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="40"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Then Peter sent them all out of the room. He knelt down and prayed, and turning toward her body, he said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="41"></a><span class="reftext">41</span>Peter took her by the hand and helped her up. Then he called the saints and widows and presented her to them alive.
