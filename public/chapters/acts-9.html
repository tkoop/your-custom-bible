<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Road to Damascus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 22:1–21; Acts 26:1–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord. He approached the high priest
<span class="reftext">2</span>and requested letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way, he could bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>As Saul drew near to Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
<span class="reftext">4</span>He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, <span>“Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>“Who are You, Lord?” Saul asked. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,”</span> He replied.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span><span class="reftext">6</span>“Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>The men <span class='spell ca'>travelling</span><span class='spell gb'>travelling</span><span class='spell us'>traveling</span> with Saul stood there speechless. They heard the voice but did not see anyone.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could not see a thing.<span class="fn">b</span>  So they led him by the hand into Damascus.
<span class="reftext">9</span>For three days he was without sight, and he did not eat or drink anything.
</p><p class="hdg">Ananias Baptizes Saul</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, <span>“Ananias!”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“Here I am, Lord,” he answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">11</span>“Get up!”</span> the Lord told him. <span>“Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.
<span class="reftext">12</span>In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But Ananias answered, “Lord, many people have told me about this man and all the harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And now he is here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on Your name.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">15</span>“Go!”</span> said the Lord. <span>“This man is My chosen instrument to carry My name before the Gentiles and their kings, and before the people of Israel.
<span class="reftext">16</span>I will show him how much he must suffer for My name.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So Ananias went to the house, and when he arrived, he placed his hands on Saul. “Brother Saul,” he said, “the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>At that instant, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and his sight was restored. He got up and was baptized,
<span class="reftext">19</span>and after taking some food, he regained his strength. And he spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.
</p><p class="hdg">Saul Preaches at Damascus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Saul promptly began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, declaring, “He is the Son of God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>All who heard him were astounded and asked, “Isn’t this the man who wreaked havoc in Jerusalem on those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But Saul was empowered all the more, and he confounded the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ.
</p><p class="hdg">The Escape from Damascus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>After many days had passed, the Jews conspired to kill him,
<span class="reftext">24</span>but Saul learned of their plot. Day and night they watched the city gates in order to kill him.
<span class="reftext">25</span>One night, however, his disciples took him and lowered him in a basket through a window in the wall.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Saul in Jerusalem</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Then Barnabas brought him to the apostles and described how Saul had seen the Lord, who spoke to him on the road to Damascus, and how Saul had spoken boldly in that city in the name of Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>So Saul stayed with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
<span class="reftext">29</span>He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews,<span class="fn">d</span>  but they tried to kill him.
<span class="reftext">30</span>When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
</p><p class="hdg">The Healing of Aeneas</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria experienced a time of peace. It grew in strength and numbers, living in the fear of the Lord and the encouragement of the Holy Spirit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>As Peter <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> throughout the area, he went to visit the saints in Lydda.
<span class="reftext">33</span>There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years.
<span class="reftext">34</span>“Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ heals you! Get up and put away your mat.” Immediately Aeneas got up,
<span class="reftext">35</span>and all who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
</p><p class="hdg">The Raising of Tabitha<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(John 11:38–44)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which is translated as Dorcas),<span class="fn">e</span>  who was always occupied with works of kindness and charity.
<span class="reftext">37</span>At that time, however, she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upper room.
<span class="reftext">38</span>Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there and sent two men to urge him, “Come to us without delay.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>So Peter got up and went with them. On his arrival, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood around him, weeping and showing him the tunics and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Then Peter sent them all out of the room. He knelt down and prayed, and turning toward her body, he said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.
<span class="reftext">41</span>Peter took her by the hand and helped her up. Then he called the saints and widows and presented her to them alive.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.
<span class="reftext">43</span>And Peter stayed for several days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> TR includes <i class="calibre6">“It is hard for you to kick against the goads.”</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">he could see nothing</i> or <i class="calibre6">he could see no one</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">through the wall</i>; see 2 Corinthians 11:33.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">29</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Hellenists</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Tabitha</i> in Aramaic and <i class="calibre6">Dorcas</i> in Greek both mean <i class="calibre6">gazelle</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
