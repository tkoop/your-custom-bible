<font ><b>A Warning to the Cities of Judah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim
son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came from the LORD: “This is
what the LORD says: Stand in the courtyard of the house of the LORD
and speak all the words I have commanded you to speak to all the
cities of Judah who come to worship there. Do not omit a word.
Perhaps they will listen and turn—each from his evil way of life—so
that I may relent of the disaster I am planning to bring upon them
because of the evil of their deeds. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you are to tell them that this is what
the LORD says: ‘If you do not listen to Me and walk in My law,
which I have set before you, and if you do not listen to the words of
My servants the prophets, whom I have sent you again and again even
though you did not listen, then I will make this house like Shiloh,
and I will make this city an object of cursing among all the nations
of the earth.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the priests and prophets and all the
people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD,
and as soon as he had finished telling all the people everything the
LORD had commanded him to say, the priests and prophets and all the
people seized him, shouting, “You must surely die! How dare you
prophesy in the name of the LORD that this house will become like
Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And all the people assembled against
Jeremiah in the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the officials of Judah heard these
things, they went up from the king’s palace to the house of the
LORD and sat there at the entrance of the New Gate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the priests and prophets said to the
officials and all the people, “This man is worthy of death, for he
has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own
ears!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jeremiah said to all the officials and
all the people, “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house
and against this city all the words that you have heard. So now,
correct your ways and deeds, and obey the voice of the LORD your God,
so that He might relent of the disaster He has pronounced against
you. As for me, here I am in your hands; do to me what you think is
good and right. But know for certain that if you put me to death, you
will bring innocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, and upon
its residents; for truly the LORD has sent me to speak all these
words in your hearing.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the officials and all the people told
the priests and prophets, “This man is not worthy of death, for he
has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some of the elders of the land stood up
and said to the whole assembly of the people, “Micah the Moreshite
prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and told all the
people of Judah that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Zion will be plowed like a field, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and the temple mount a wooded ridge.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else
in Judah put him to death? Did Hezekiah not fear the LORD and seek
His favor, and did not the LORD relent of the disaster He had
pronounced against them? But we are about to bring great harm on
ourselves!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now there was another man prophesying in
the name of the LORD, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He
prophesied against this city and against this land the same things
that Jeremiah did. King Jehoiakim and all his mighty men and
officials heard his words, and the king sought to put him to death.
But when Uriah found out about it, he fled in fear and went to Egypt.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt:
Elnathan son of Achbor along with some other men. They brought Uriah
out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him put to the
sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, Ahikam son of Shaphan
supported Jeremiah, so he was not handed over to the people to be put
to death. </font>
