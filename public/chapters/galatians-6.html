<font >Brothers, if someone is caught in a
trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of
gentleness. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted. Carry one
another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of
Christ. </font>

is nothing, he deceives himself. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Each one should test his own work. Then he
will have reason to boast in himself alone, and not in someone else.
For each one should carry his own load. Nevertheless, the one who
receives instruction in the word must share in all good things with
his instructor. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not be deceived: God is not to be
mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap in return. The one who sows
to please his flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; but the
one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal
life. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Let us not grow weary in well-doing, for
in due time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore,
as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to
the family of faith. </font>

<font >Those who want to make a good impression
outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. They only do
this to avoid persecution for the cross of Christ. For the
circumcised do not even keep the law themselves, yet they want you to
be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But as for me, may I never boast, except
in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has
been crucified to me, and I to the world. For neither circumcision
nor uncircumcision means anything. What counts is a new creation. </font>
