<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Carry One Another’s Burdens</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Brothers, if someone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of gentleness. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Carry one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Each one should test his own work. Then he will have reason to boast in himself alone, and not in someone else.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For each one should carry his own load.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word must share in all good things with his instructor.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap in return.
<span class="reftext">8</span>The one who sows to please his flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; but the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to the family of faith.
</p><p class="hdg">Final Warnings and Blessings</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>See what large letters I am using to write to you with my own hand!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. They only do this to avoid persecution for the cross of Christ.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For the circumcised do not even keep the law themselves, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But as for me, may I never boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which<span class="fn">a</span>  the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything. What counts is a new creation.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Peace and mercy to all who walk by this rule, even to the Israel of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. </p><p class="reg1"> Amen.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">through whom</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
