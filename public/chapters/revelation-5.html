<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Lamb Takes the Scroll</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> seated on the throne. It had writing on both sides and was sealed with seven seals.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look inside it.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And I began to weep bitterly, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! Behold, the <span class='cap'>Lion</span><span class='nocap'>lion</span> of the tribe of Judah, the <span class='cap'>Root</span><span class='nocap'>root</span> of David, has triumphed to open the scroll and its seven seals.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then I saw a Lamb who appeared to have been slain, standing in the <span class='spell ca'>centre</span><span class='spell gb'>centre</span><span class='spell us'>center</span> of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the seven <span class='cap'>Spirits</span><span class='nocap'>spirits</span><span class="fn">a</span>  of God sent out into all the earth.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> came and took the scroll from the right hand of the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> seated on the throne.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp, and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And they sang a new song: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Worthy are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> to take the scroll and open its seals, </p><p class="indent"> because <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> were slain, </p><p class="indent1"> and by <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> blood <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> purchased for God </p><p class="indent"> those from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>You have made them to be a kingdom </p><p class="indent"> and priests to serve our God, </p><p class="indent"> and they will reign upon<span class="fn">b</span>  the earth.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Lamb Exalted</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels and living creatures and elders encircling the throne, and their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands.
<span class="reftext">12</span>In a loud voice they were saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, </p><p class="indent"> to receive power and riches </p><p class="indent1"> and wisdom and strength </p><p class="indent"> and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> and glory and blessing!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">“To <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> who sits on the throne </p><p class="indent"> and to the Lamb </p><p class="indent1"> be praise and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> and glory and power </p><p class="indent"> forever and ever!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And the four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped.<span class="fn">c</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the sevenfold Spirit</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">they will reign over</i>; WH <i class="calibre6">they reign upon</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> TR includes <i class="calibre6">Him who lives for ever and ever</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
