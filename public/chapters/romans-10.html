<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer
to God for the Israelites is for their salvation. For I testify about
them that they are zealous for God, but not on the basis of
knowledge. Because they were ignorant of God’s righteousness and
sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s
righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law, to bring
righteousness to everyone who believes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For concerning the righteousness that is
by the law, Moses writes: “The man who does these things will live
by them.” But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not
say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ (that is, to
bring Christ down) or, ‘Who will descend into the Abyss?’ (that
is, to bring Christ up from the dead).” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But what does it say? “The word is near
you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the word of
faith we are proclaiming: that if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus
is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the
dead, you will be saved. For with your heart you believe and are
justified, and with your mouth you confess and are saved. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">It is just as the Scripture says: “Anyone
who believes in Him will never be put to shame.” For there is no
difference between Jew and Greek: The same Lord is Lord of all, and
gives richly to all who call on Him, for, “Everyone who calls on
the name of the Lord will be saved.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">How then can they call on the One in whom
they have not believed? And how can they believe in the One of whom
they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone to preach?
And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How
beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But not all of them welcomed the good
news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”
Consequently, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of
Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But I ask, did they not hear? Indeed they
did: </font>
