<font ><b>The Word Brings Salvation</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer
to God for the Israelites is for their salvation. For I testify about
them that they are zealous for God, but not on the basis of
knowledge. Because they were ignorant of God’s righteousness and
sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s
righteousness. For Christ is the end of the law, to bring
righteousness to everyone who believes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For concerning the righteousness that is
by the law, Moses writes: “The man who does these things will live
by them.” But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not
say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ (that is, to
bring Christ down) or, ‘Who will descend into the Abyss?’ (that
is, to bring Christ up from the dead).” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But what does it say? “The word is near
you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the word of
faith we are proclaiming: that if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus
is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the
dead, you will be saved. For with your heart you believe and are
justified, and with your mouth you confess and are saved. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >It is just as the Scripture says: “Anyone
who believes in Him will never be put to shame.” For there is no
difference between Jew and Greek: The same Lord is Lord of all, and
gives richly to all who call on Him, for, “Everyone who calls on
the name of the Lord will be saved.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >How then can they call on the One in whom
they have not believed? And how can they believe in the One of whom
they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone to preach?
And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How
beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But not all of them welcomed the good
news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”
Consequently, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of
Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But I ask, did they not hear? Indeed they
did: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Their voice has gone out into all the
earth, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >their words to the ends of the world.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I ask instead, did Israel not understand?
First, Moses says: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >I will make you jealous by those who
are not a nation; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will make you angry by a nation without
understanding.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Isaiah boldly says: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >I was found by those who did not seek
Me; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I revealed Myself to those who did not ask
for Me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But as for Israel he says: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >All day long I have held out My hands </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >to a disobedient and obstinate people.” </font>
