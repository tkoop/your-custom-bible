<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Word Brings Salvation<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 65:1–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is for their salvation.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For I testify about them that they are zealous for God, but not on the basis of knowledge.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Because they were ignorant of God’s righteousness and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.
<span class="reftext">4</span>For Christ is the end of the law, to bring righteousness to everyone who believes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>For concerning the righteousness that is by the law, Moses writes: “The man who does these things will live by them.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’<span class="fn">b</span>  (that is, to bring Christ down)
<span class="reftext">7</span>or, ‘Who will descend into the Abyss?’<span class="fn">c</span>  (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,”<span class="fn">d</span>  that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming:
<span class="reftext">9</span>that if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For with your heart you believe and are justified, and with your mouth you confess and are saved.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>It is just as the Scripture says: “Anyone who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For there is no difference between Jew and Greek: The same Lord is Lord of all, and gives richly to all who call on Him,
<span class="reftext">13</span>for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>How then can they call on the One in whom they have not believed? And how can they believe in the One of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone to preach?
<span class="reftext">15</span>And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But not all of them welcomed the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Consequently, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>But I ask, did they not hear? Indeed they did: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Their voice has gone out into all the earth, </p><p class="indent"> their words to the ends of the world.”<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>I ask instead, did Israel not understand? First, Moses says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation; </p><p class="indent"> I will make you angry by a nation without understanding.”<span class="fn">j</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Isaiah boldly says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I was found by those who did not seek Me; </p><p class="indent"> I revealed Myself to those who did not ask for Me.”<span class="fn">k</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>But as for Israel he says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“All day long I have held out My hands </p><p class="indent"> to a disobedient and obstinate people.”<span class="fn">l</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Leviticus 18:5; see also Ezekiel 20:11, 13, and 21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Deuteronomy 30:12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> See Deuteronomy 30:13.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Deuteronomy 30:14<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Isaiah 28:16 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Joel 2:32<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">good news of good things</i>; BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of peace, who bring good news of good things</i>; Isaiah 52:7<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Isaiah 53:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Psalm 19:4 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Deuteronomy 32:21 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Isaiah 65:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> Isaiah 65:2 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
