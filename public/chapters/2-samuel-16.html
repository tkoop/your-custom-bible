<font ><b>David and Ziba</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When David had gone a little beyond the
summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him. He
had a pair of saddled donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of
bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a
skin of wine. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Why do you have these?” asked the
king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the
king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the
young men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become
exhausted in the wilderness.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Where is your master’s grandson?”
asked the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Ziba answered, “Indeed, he is
staying in Jerusalem, for he has said, ‘Today, the house of Israel
will restore to me the kingdom of my grandfather.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king said to Ziba, “All that
belongs to Mephibosheth is now yours!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I humbly bow before you,” said Ziba.
“May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As King David approached Bahurim, a man
from the family of the house of Saul was just coming out. His name
was Shimei son of Gera, and as he approached, he kept yelling out
curses. He threw stones at David and at all the servants of the king,
though the troops and all the mighty men were on David’s right and
left. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And as he yelled curses, Shimei said, “Get
out, get out, you worthless man of bloodshed! The LORD has paid you
back for all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have
reigned, and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of your
son Absalom. See, you have come to ruin because you are a man of
bloodshed!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the
king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go
over and cut off his head!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the king replied, “What have I to do
with you, O sons of Zeruiah? If he curses me because the LORD told
him, ‘Curse David,’ who can ask, ‘Why did you do this?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David said to Abishai and to all his
servants, “Behold, my own son, my own flesh and blood, seeks my
life. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone and let
him curse me, for the LORD has told him so. Perhaps the LORD will see
my affliction and repay me with good for the cursing I receive
today.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David and his men proceeded along the
road as Shimei went along the ridge of the hill opposite him. As
Shimei went, he yelled curses, threw stones, and flung dust at David.
Finally, the king and all the people with him arrived, exhausted. And
there he refreshed himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Absalom and all the men of Israel
came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him. And David’s friend
Hushai the Archite went to Absalom and said to him, “Long live the
king! Long live the king!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Is this the loyalty you show your
friend?” Absalom replied. “Why did you not go with your friend?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Not at all,” Hushai answered. “For
the one chosen by the LORD, by the people, and by all the men of
Israel—his I will be, and with him I will remain. Furthermore, whom
should I serve if not the son? As I served in your father’s
presence, so also I will serve in yours.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give
me counsel. What should we do?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ahithophel replied, “Sleep with your
father’s concubines, whom he has left to keep the palace. When all
Israel hears that you have become a stench to your father, then the
hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the
roof, and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all
Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now in those days the advice of Ahithophel
was like the consultation of the word of God. Such was the regard
that both David and Absalom had for Ahithophel’s advice. </font>
