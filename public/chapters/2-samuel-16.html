<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">David and Ziba</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When David had gone a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him. He had a pair of saddled donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a skin of wine.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Why do you have these?” asked the king. </p><p class="reg1"> Ziba replied, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the wilderness.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>“Where is your master’s grandson?” asked the king. </p><p class="reg1"> And Ziba answered, “Indeed, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he has said, ‘Today, the house of Israel will restore to me the kingdom of my grandfather.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So the king said to Ziba, “All that belongs to Mephibosheth is now yours!” </p><p class="reg1">“I humbly bow before you,” said Ziba. “May I find <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in your eyes, my lord the king!”
</p><p class="hdg">Shimei Curses David</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the family of the house of Saul was just coming out. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and as he approached, he kept yelling out curses.
<span class="reftext">6</span>He threw stones at David and at all the servants of the king, though the troops and all the mighty men were on David’s right and left.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>And as he yelled curses, Shimei said, “Get out, get out, you worthless man of bloodshed!
<span class="reftext">8</span>The LORD has paid you back for all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned, and the LORD has delivered the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, you have come to ruin because you are a man of bloodshed!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>But the king replied, “What have I to do with you, O sons of Zeruiah? If he curses me because the LORD told him, ‘Curse David,’ who can ask, ‘Why did you do this?’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Behold, my own son, my own flesh and blood, seeks my life. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone and let him curse me, for the LORD has told him so.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Perhaps the LORD will see my affliction and repay me with good for the cursing I receive today.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So David and his men proceeded along the road as Shimei went along the ridge of the hill opposite him. As Shimei went, he yelled curses, threw stones, and flung dust at David.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Finally, the king and all the people with him arrived,<span class="fn">a</span>  exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.
</p><p class="hdg">The Counsel of Ahithophel and Hushai</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And David’s friend Hushai the Archite went to Absalom and said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>“Is this the loyalty you show your friend?” Absalom replied. “Why did you not go with your friend?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>“Not at all,” Hushai answered. “For the one chosen by the LORD, by the people, and by all the men of Israel—his I will be, and with him I will remain.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Furthermore, whom should I serve if not the son? As I served in your father’s presence, so also I will serve in yours.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give me counsel. What should we do?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Ahithophel replied, “Sleep with your father’s concubines, whom he has left to keep the palace. When all Israel hears that you have become a stench to your father, then the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Now in those days the advice of Ahithophel was like the consultation of the word of God. Such was the regard that both David and Absalom had for Ahithophel’s advice.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Some LXX manuscripts <i class="calibre6">arrived at the Jordan</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
