<font ><b>Offering Firstfruits and Tithes</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When you enter the land that the LORD your
God is giving you as an inheritance, and you take possession of it
and settle in it, you are to take some of the firstfruits of all your
produce from the soil of the land that the LORD your God is giving
you and put them in a basket. Then go to the place the LORD your God
will choose as a dwelling for His Name, to the priest who is serving
at that time, and say to him, “I declare today to the LORD your God
that I have entered the land that the LORD swore to our fathers to
give us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the priest shall take the basket from
your hands and place it before the altar of the LORD your God, and
you are to declare before the LORD your God, “My father was a
wandering Aramean, and he went down to Egypt few in number and lived
there and became a great nation, mighty and numerous. But the
Egyptians mistreated us and afflicted us, putting us to hard labor.
So we called out to the LORD, the God of our fathers; and the LORD
heard our voice and saw our affliction, toil, and oppression. Then
the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an
outstretched arm, with great terror, signs, and wonders. And He
brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with
milk and honey. And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of
the land that You, O LORD, have given me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then you are to place the basket before
the LORD your God and bow down before Him. So you shall rejoice—you,
the Levite, and the foreigner dwelling among you—in all the good
things the LORD your God has given to you and your household. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When you have finished laying aside a
tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe,
you are to give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and
the widow, that they may eat and be filled within your gates. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then you shall declare in the presence of
the LORD your God, “I have removed from my house the sacred portion
and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and
the widow, according to all the commandments You have given me. I
have not transgressed or forgotten Your commandments. I have not
eaten any of the sacred portion while in mourning, or removed any of
it while unclean, or offered any of it for the dead. I have obeyed
the LORD my God; I have done everything You commanded me. Look down
from Your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel
and the land You have given us as You swore to our fathers—a land
flowing with milk and honey.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD your God commands you this day to
follow these statutes and ordinances. You must be careful to follow
them with all your heart and with all your soul. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Today you have proclaimed that the LORD is
your God and that you will walk in His ways, keep His statutes and
commandments and ordinances, and listen to His voice. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And today the LORD has proclaimed that you
are His people and treasured possession as He promised, that you are
to keep all His commandments, that He will set you high in praise and
name and honor above all the nations He has made, and that you will
be a holy people to the LORD your God, as He has promised. </font>
