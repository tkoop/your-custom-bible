<font ><b>Serving with Honor</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All who are under the yoke of slavery
should regard their masters as fully worthy of honor, so that God’s
name and our teaching will not be discredited. Those who have
believing masters should not show disrespect because they are
brothers, but should serve them all the more, since those receiving
their good service are beloved believers. Teach and encourage these
principles. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If anyone teaches another doctrine and
disagrees with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and with
godly teaching, he is conceited and understands nothing. Instead, he
has an unhealthy interest in controversies and semantics, out of
which come envy, strife, abusive talk, evil suspicions, and constant
friction between men of depraved mind who are devoid of the truth.
These men regard godliness as a means of gain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Of course, godliness with contentment is
great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, so we cannot carry
anything out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be
content with these. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Those who want to be rich, however, fall
into temptation and become ensnared by many foolish and harmful
desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction. For the love of
money is the root of all kinds of evil. By craving it, some have
wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many
sorrows. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But you, O man of God, flee from these
things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
perseverance, and gentleness. Fight the good fight of the faith. Take
hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made the
good confession before many witnesses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I charge you in the presence of God, who
gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who made the good
confession in His testimony before Pontius Pilate: Keep this
commandment without stain or reproach until the appearance of our
Lord Jesus Christ, which the blessed and only Sovereign One—the
King of kings and Lord of lords—will bring about in His own time.
He alone is immortal and dwells in unapproachable light. No one has
ever seen Him, nor can anyone see Him. To Him be honor and eternal
dominion! Amen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Instruct those who are rich in the present
age not to be conceited and not to put their hope in the uncertainty
of wealth, but in God, who richly provides all things for us to
enjoy. Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, and to be
generous and ready to share, treasuring up for themselves a firm
foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which
is truly life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted
to you. Avoid irreverent, empty chatter and the opposing arguments of
so-called “knowledge,” which some have professed and thus swerved
away from the faith. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Grace be with you all. </font>
