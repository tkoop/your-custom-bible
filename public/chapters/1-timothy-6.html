<span class="reftext">2</span>Those who have believing masters should not show disrespect because they are brothers, but should serve them all the more, since those receiving their good service are beloved believers. Teach and encourage these principles.

<span class="reftext">4</span>he is conceited and understands nothing. Instead, he has an unhealthy interest in controversies and semantics, out of which come envy, strife, abusive talk, evil suspicions,
<span class="reftext">5</span>and constant friction between men of depraved mind who are devoid of the truth. These men regard godliness as a means of gain.<span class="fn">a</span>

<span class="reftext">10</span>For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. By craving it, some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.
</p><p class="hdg">Fight the Good Fight</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But you, O man of God, flee from these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> testimony before Pontius Pilate:
<span class="reftext">14</span>Keep this commandment without stain or reproach until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ,
