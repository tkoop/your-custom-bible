</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>David also defeated the Moabites, made them lie down on the ground, and measured them off with a cord. He measured off with two lengths those to be put to death, and with one length those to be spared. So the Moabites became subject to David and brought him tribute.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>David also defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, who had marched out to restore his dominion along the Euphrates River.<span class="fn">b</span>

<span class="reftext">10</span>he sent his son Joram<span class="fn">f</span>  to greet King David and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Toi. Joram brought with him articles of silver and gold and bronze,

<span class="reftext">12</span>from Edom<span class="fn">g</span>  and Moab, from the Ammonites and Philistines and Amalekites, and from the spoil of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And David made a name for himself when he returned from striking down eighteen thousand Edomites<span class="fn">h</span>  in the Valley of Salt.
