Philistines. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David also defeated the Moabites, made
them lie down on the ground, and measured them off with a cord. He
measured off with two lengths those to be put to death, and with one
length those to be spared. So the Moabites became subject to David
and brought him tribute. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David also defeated Hadadezer son of
Rehob, king of Zobah, who had marched out to restore his dominion
along the Euphrates River. David captured from him a thousand
chariots, seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand foot
soldiers, and he hamstrung all the horses except a hundred he kept
for the chariots. </font>

<font >When the Arameans of Damascus came to help
King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand men.
Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became
subject to David and brought him tribute. So the LORD made David
victorious wherever he went. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David took the gold shields that
belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
And from Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a
large amount of bronze. </font>

<font >When King Toi of Hamath heard that David
had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer, he sent his son Joram to
greet King David and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer,
who had been at war with Toi. Joram brought with him articles of
silver and gold and bronze, and King David dedicated these to the
LORD, along with the silver and gold he had dedicated from all the
nations he had subdued— from Edom and Moab, from the Ammonites and
Philistines and Amalekites, and from the spoil of Hadadezer son of
Rehob, king of Zobah. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David made a name for himself when he
returned from striking down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley
of Salt. He placed garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites
were subject to David. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he
went. </font>
