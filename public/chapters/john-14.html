hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe in Me as well. In My
Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told
you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come back and welcome you into My
presence, so that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Philip,
I have been with you all this time, and still you do not know Me?
Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show
us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the
Father is in Me? The words I say to you, I do not speak on My own.
Instead, it is the Father dwelling in Me, performing His works.
Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me—or at
least believe on account of the works themselves.</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Truly, truly, I tell
you, whoever believes in Me will also do the works that I am doing.
He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the
Father. And I will do whatever you ask in My name, so that the Father
may be glorified in the Son. If you ask Me for anything in My name, I
will do it. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >If you love Me, you
will keep My commandments. And I will ask the Father, and He will
give you another Advocate to be with you forever— the Spirit of
truth. The world cannot receive Him, because it neither sees Him nor
knows Him. But you do know Him, for He abides with you and will be in
you. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >I will not leave you
as orphans; I will come to you. In a little while the world will see
Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you also will live.
On that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you are in Me,
and I am in you. Whoever has My commandments and keeps them is the
one who loves Me. The one who loves Me will be loved by My Father,
and I will love him and reveal Myself to him.” </font></font>

why are You going to reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?” </font>

<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“If
anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and
We will come to him and make Our home with him. Whoever does not love
Me does not keep My words. The word that you hear is not My own, but
it is from the Father who sent Me.</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Peace I leave with
you; My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives.
Do not let your hearts be troubled; do not be afraid. You heard Me
say, ‘I am going away, and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved
Me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the
Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it happens,
so that when it does happen, you will believe. </font></font>

with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming, and he

Me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. </font></font>
