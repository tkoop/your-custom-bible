<span class="reftext">2</span>In My Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and welcome you into My presence, so that you also may be where I am.
<span class="reftext">4</span>You know the way to the place where I am going.<span class="fn">c</span>”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Way, the Truth, and the Life</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>“Lord,” said Thomas, “we do not know where You are going, so how can we know the way?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Jesus answered, <span>“I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.
<span class="reftext">7</span>If you had known Me, you would know My Father as well. From now on you do know Him and have seen Him.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Philip, I have been with you all this time, and still you do not know Me? Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?
<span class="reftext">10</span>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? The words I say to you, I do not speak on My own. Instead, it is the Father dwelling in Me, performing His works.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me—or at least believe on account of the works themselves.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">12</span>Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever believes in Me will also do the works that I am doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.
<span class="reftext">13</span>And I will do whatever you ask in My name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
<span class="reftext">14</span>If you ask Me<span class="fn">d</span>  for anything in My name, I will do it.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(John 16:5–16)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">15</span>If you love Me, you will keep<span class="fn">e</span>  My commandments.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate<span class="fn">f</span>  to be with you forever—
<span class="reftext">17</span>the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive Him, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. But you do know Him, for He abides with you and will be in you.<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">18</span>I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.
<span class="reftext">19</span>In a little while the world will see Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you also will live.
<span class="reftext">20</span>On that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you are in Me, and I am in you.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Whoever has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me. The one who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and reveal Myself to him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Judas (not Iscariot) asked Him, “Lord, why are You going to reveal Yourself to us and not to the world?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Jesus replied, <span>“If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word. My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Whoever does not love Me does not keep My words. The word that you hear is not My own, but it is from the Father who sent Me.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">25</span>All this I have spoken to you while I am still with you.
<span class="reftext">26</span>But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have told you.
</p><p class="hdg">Peace I Leave with You</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">27</span>Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled; do not be afraid.
<span class="reftext">28</span>You heard Me say, ‘I am going away, and I am coming back to you.’ If you loved Me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I.
<span class="reftext">29</span>And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it does happen, you will believe.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">30</span>I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming, and he has no claim on Me.
<span class="reftext">31</span>But I do exactly what the Father has commanded Me, so that the world may know that I love the Father. </p><p class="calibre3"> Get up!
