<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Philip,
I have been with you all this time, and still you do not know Me?
Anyone who has seen Me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show
us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the
Father is in Me? The words I say to you, I do not speak on My own.
Instead, it is the Father dwelling in Me, performing His works.
Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me—or at
least believe on account of the works themselves.</font> </font>

you, whoever believes in Me will also do the works that I am doing.
He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the
Father. And I will do whatever you ask in My name, so that the Father
may be glorified in the Son. If you ask Me for anything in My name, I
will do it. </font></font>

knows Him. But you do know Him, for He abides with you and will be in
you. </font></font>

one who loves Me. The one who loves Me will be loved by My Father,

Me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the
Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it happens,
