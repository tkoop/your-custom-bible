<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King David said to the whole
assembly, “My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young
and inexperienced. The task is great because this palace is not for
man, but for the LORD God. Now with all my ability I have made
provision for the house of my God—gold for the gold articles,
silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron, and
wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise,
stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and slabs of
marble—all in abundance. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moreover, because of my delight in the
house of my God, I now give for it my personal treasures of gold and
silver, over and above all that I have provided for this holy temple:
three thousand talents of gold (the gold of Ophir) and seven thousand
talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the buildings, for
the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by
the craftsmen. Now who will volunteer to consecrate himself to the
LORD today?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the leaders of the households, the
officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of
hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave
willingly. Toward the service of God’s house they gave 5,000
talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000
talents of bronze, and 100,000 talents of iron. Whoever had precious
stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, under the
care of Jehiel the Gershonite. And the people rejoiced at the willing
response of their leaders, for they had given to the LORD freely and
wholeheartedly. And King David also rejoiced greatly. </font>

thanks, and we praise Your glorious name. But who am I, and who are
my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For

all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without

given willingly and with an upright heart, and now I have seen Your
people who are present here giving joyfully and willingly to You. </font>

and Israel, keep this desire forever in the intentions of the hearts

Solomon a whole heart to keep and carry out all Your commandments,
