The task is great because this palace is not for man, but for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Now with all my ability I have made provision for the house of my God—gold for the gold articles, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron, and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise, stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and slabs of marble—all in abundance.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Moreover, because of my delight in the house of my God, I now give for it my personal treasures of gold and silver, over and above all that I have provided for this holy temple:
<span class="reftext">4</span>three thousand talents of gold<span class="fn">a</span>  (the gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents of refined silver,<span class="fn">b</span>  to overlay the walls of the buildings,
<span class="reftext">5</span>for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now who will volunteer to consecrate himself to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> today?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then the leaders of the households, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king’s work gave willingly.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Toward the service of God’s house they gave 5,000 talents<span class="fn">c</span>  and 10,000 darics of gold,<span class="fn">d</span>  10,000 talents of silver,<span class="fn">e</span>  18,000 talents of bronze,<span class="fn">f</span>  and 100,000 talents of iron.<span class="fn">g</span> 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, under the care of Jehiel<span class="fn">h</span>  the Gershonite.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> freely and wholeheartedly. And King David also rejoiced greatly.

</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Now therefore, our God, we give You thanks, and we praise Your glorious name.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from You, and from Your own hand we have given to You.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For we are foreigners and strangers in Your presence, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span> our God, from Your hand comes all this abundance that we have provided to build You a house for Your holy Name, and all of it belongs to You.
<span class="reftext">17</span>I know, my God, that You test the heart and delight in uprightness. All these things I have given willingly and with an upright heart, and now I have seen Your people who are present here giving joyfully and willingly to You.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep this desire forever in the intentions of the hearts of Your people, and direct their hearts toward You.

<span class="reftext">24</span>All the officials and mighty men, as well as all of King David’s sons, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him royal majesty such as had not been bestowed on any king in Israel before him.
