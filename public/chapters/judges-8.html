<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Gideon Defeats Zebah and Zalmunna</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the men of Ephraim said to Gideon, “Why have you done this to us? Why did <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> fail to call us when you went to fight against Midian?” And they contended with him violently.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>But Gideon answered them, “Now what have I accomplished compared to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?
<span class="reftext">3</span>God has delivered Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian, into your hand. What was I able to do compared to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>?” When he had said this, their anger<span class="fn">a</span>  against him subsided.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Gideon and his three hundred men came to the Jordan and crossed it, exhausted yet still in pursuit.
<span class="reftext">5</span>So Gideon said to the men of Succoth, “Please give my troops some bread, for they are exhausted, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>But the leaders of Succoth asked, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession, that we should give bread to your army?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>“Very well,” Gideon replied, “when <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with the thorns and briers of the wilderness!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>From there he went up to Penuel<span class="fn">b</span>  and asked the same from them, but the men of Penuel gave the same response as the men of Succoth.
<span class="reftext">9</span>So Gideon told the men of Penuel, “When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army of about fifteen thousand men—all that were left of the armies of the people of the east. A hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had already fallen.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Gideon went up by way of the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he attacked their army, taking them by surprise.
<span class="reftext">12</span>When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, Gideon pursued and captured these two kings of Midian, routing their entire army.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>After this, Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle along the Ascent of Heres.
<span class="reftext">14</span>There he captured a young man of Succoth and interrogated him. The young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven leaders and elders of Succoth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And Gideon went to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> taunted me, saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your possession, that we should give bread to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> weary men?’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
<span class="reftext">16</span>Then he took the elders of the city, and using the thorns and briers of the wilderness, he disciplined the men of Succoth.
<span class="reftext">17</span>He also pulled down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Next, Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> kill at Tabor?” </p><p class="reg1">“Men like you,” they answered, “each one resembling the son of a king.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>“They were my brothers,” Gideon replied, “the sons of my mother! As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives, if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> had let them live, I would not kill <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So he said to Jether, his firstborn, “Get up and kill them.” But the young man did not draw his sword; he was fearful because he was still a youth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Get up and kill us yourself, for as the man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments from the necks of their camels.
</p><p class="hdg">Gideon’s Ephod</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then the Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you and your son and grandson—for you have saved us from the hand of Midian.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But Gideon replied, “I will not rule over <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, nor will my son. <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> shall rule over <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then he added, “Let me make a request of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, that each of you give me an earring from his plunder.” (For the enemies had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites.)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>“We will give them gladly,” they replied. </p><p class="reg1"> So they spread out a garment, and each man threw an earring from his plunder onto it.
<span class="reftext">26</span>The weight of the gold earrings he had requested was 1,700 shekels,<span class="fn">c</span>  in addition to the crescent ornaments, the pendants, the purple garments of the kings of Midian, and the chains from the necks of their camels.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>From all this Gideon made an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his hometown. But soon all Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his household.
</p><p class="hdg">Forty Years of Peace</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>In this way Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. So the land had rest for forty years in the days of Gideon,
<span class="reftext">29</span>and he—Jerubbaal<span class="fn">d</span>  son of Joash—returned home and settled down.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Gideon had seventy sons of his own,<span class="fn">e</span>  since he had many wives.
<span class="reftext">31</span>His concubine, who dwelt in Shechem, also bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech.
</p><p class="hdg">Gideon’s Death</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Later, Gideon son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>And as soon as Gideon was dead, the Israelites turned and prostituted themselves with the Baals, and they set up Baal-berith as their god.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>The Israelites failed to remember <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> their God who had delivered them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.
<span class="reftext">35</span>They did not show kindness to the house of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) for all the good things he had done for Israel.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">their spirit</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Penuel</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Peniel</i>; also in verses 9 and 17; see Genesis 32:30.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">1,700 shekels</i> is approximately 42.7 pounds or 19.4 kilograms.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">29</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Jerubbaal</i> is another name for <i class="calibre6">Gideon</i> and probably means <i class="calibre6">let Baal contend</i>; also in verse 35; see Judges 6:32.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">who came from his own loins</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
