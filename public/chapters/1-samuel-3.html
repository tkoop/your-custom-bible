<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg"><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> Calls Samuel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the boy Samuel ministered to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> before Eli. </p><p class="reg1"> Now in those days the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was rare and visions were scarce.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And at that time Eli, whose eyesight had grown so dim that he could not see, was lying in his room.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Before the lamp of God had gone out, Samuel was lying down in the temple of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, where the ark of God was located.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> called to Samuel, and he answered, “Here I am.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” </p><p class="reg1">“I did not call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.” </p><p class="reg1"> So he went and lay down.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Once again <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> called, “Samuel!” </p><p class="reg1"> So Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” </p><p class="reg1">“My son, I did not call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now Samuel did not yet know <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, because the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had not yet been revealed to him.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Once again, for the third time, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> called to Samuel. He got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you have called me.” </p><p class="reg1"> Then Eli <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that it was <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> who was calling the boy.
<span class="reftext">9</span>“Go and lie down,” he said to Samuel, “and if <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> calls you, say, ‘Speak, <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, for <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> servant is listening.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1"> So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came and stood there, calling as before, “Samuel! Samuel!” </p><p class="reg1"> And Samuel answered, “Speak, for <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> servant is listening.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Samuel, “I am about to do something in Israel at which the ears of all who hear it will tingle.
<span class="reftext">12</span>On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I have spoken about his family, from beginning to end.
<span class="reftext">13</span>I told him that I would judge his house forever for the iniquity of which he knows, because his sons blasphemed God<span class="fn">a</span>  and he did not restrain them.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, ‘The iniquity of Eli’s house shall never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">Samuel Shares the Vision</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,
<span class="reftext">16</span>but Eli called to him and said, “Samuel, my son.” </p><p class="reg1">“Here I am,” answered Samuel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>“What was the message <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> gave you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide it from me. May God punish you, and ever so severely, if you hide from me anything <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said to you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>So Samuel told him everything and did not hide a thing from him. </p><p class="reg1">“He is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,” replied Eli. “Let <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> do what is good in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> eyes.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And Samuel grew, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was with him, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> continued to appear at Shiloh, because there <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> revealed <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> to Samuel by <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> word.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">made themselves contemptible</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
