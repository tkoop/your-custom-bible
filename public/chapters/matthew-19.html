<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus had finished saying these
things, He left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the
Jordan. Large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then some Pharisees came and tested Him by
asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any
reason?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“Have
you not read that from the beginning the Creator ‘made them male
and female,’ and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his
father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become
one flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore
what God has joined together, let man not separate.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Why then,” they asked, “did Moses
order a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her
away?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Moses
permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of
heart; but it was not this way from the beginning. Now I tell you
that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and
marries another woman, commits adultery.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >His disciples said to Him, “If this is
the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Not everyone can
accept this word,”</font> He replied, <font color="#a80000">“but
only those to whom it has been given. For there are eunuchs who were
born that way; others were made that way by men; and still others
live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who
can accept this should accept it.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the little children were brought to
Jesus for Him to place His hands on them and pray for them. And the
disciples rebuked those who brought them. But Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“Let
the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the
kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”</font> And after He
had placed His hands on them, He went on from there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Just then a man came up to Jesus and
inquired, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal
life?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Why do you ask Me
about what is good?” </font>Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“There
is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the
commandments.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Which ones?” the man asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font color="#880000"> </font></font><font color="#a80000">‘Do
not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false
witness, honor your father and mother, and love your neighbor as
yourself.’”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >All these I have kept,” said the
young man. “What do I still lack?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus told him, <font color="#a80000">“If
you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the
poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the young man heard this, he went
away in sorrow, because he had great wealth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“Truly
I tell you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of
a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the disciples heard this, they were
greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus looked at them and said, <font color="#a80000">“With
man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Look,” Peter replied, “we have left
everything to follow You. What then will there be for us?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Truly
I tell you, in the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on
His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve
thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has
left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or
children or fields for the sake of My name will receive a hundredfold
and will inherit eternal life. But many who are first will be last,
and the last will be first.</font> </font>
