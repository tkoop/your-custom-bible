<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Teachings about Divorce<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 10:1–12)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When Jesus had finished saying these things, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> left Galilee and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Large crowds followed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> healed them there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then some Pharisees came and tested <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> by asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Jesus answered, <span>“Have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not read that from the beginning the <span class='cap'>Creator</span><span class='nocap'>creator</span> ‘made them male and female,’<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">5</span>and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’<span class="fn">b</span>?
<span class="reftext">6</span>So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>“Why then,” they asked, “did Moses order a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?<span class="fn">c</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Moses permitted <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to divorce <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> wives because of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hardness of heart; but it was not this way from the beginning.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Now I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman, commits adultery.<span class="fn">d</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>His disciples said to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “If this is the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">11</span>“Not everyone can accept this word,”</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> replied, <span>“but only those to whom it has been given.
<span class="reftext">12</span>For there are eunuchs who were born that way; others were made that way by men; and still others live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Blesses the Children<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 10:13–16; Luke 18:15–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then the little children were brought to Jesus for <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> to place <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hands on them and pray for them. And the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But Jesus said, <span>“Let the little children come to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”</span>
<span class="reftext">15</span>And after <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had placed <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hands on them, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> went on from there.
</p><p class="hdg">The Rich Young Man<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 10:17–31; Luke 18:18–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Just then a man came up to Jesus and inquired, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">17</span>“Why do you ask <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> about what is good?”<span class="fn">e</span> </span> Jesus replied. <span>“There is only <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>“Which ones?” the man asked. </p><p class="reg1"> Jesus answered, <span>“<span class="thinq"> </span>‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness,
<span class="reftext">19</span><span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> your father and mother, and love your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> as yourself.’<span class="fn">f</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>“All these I have kept,” said the young man. “What do I still lack?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Jesus told him, <span>“If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>When the young man heard this, he went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then Jesus said to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples, <span>“Truly I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Again I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Jesus looked at them and said, <span>“With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>“Look,” Peter replied, “we have left everything to follow <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>. What then will there be for us?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“Truly I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, in the renewal of all things,<span class="fn">g</span>  when the Son of Man sits on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> glorious throne, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> who have followed <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
<span class="reftext">29</span>And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife<span class="fn">h</span>  or children or fields for the sake of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.
<span class="reftext">30</span>But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.</span></p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Genesis 1:27; Genesis 5:2<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Genesis 2:24 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> See Deuteronomy 24:1.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> SBL and BYZ include <i class="calibre6">And he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery</i>; see Matthew 5:32.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6"><span class="fnv">16</span>...“Good Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?” <span class="fnv">17</span>“Why do you call Me good?”</i> See Mark 10:17–18 and Luke 18:18–19.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Exodus 20:12–16; Leviticus 19:18; Deuteronomy 5:16–20<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the regeneration</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">29</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> NE, WH, and NA do not include <i class="calibre6">or wife</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
