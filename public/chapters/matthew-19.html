<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then some Pharisees came and tested Him by
asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any
reason?” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“Have
you not read that from the beginning the Creator ‘made them male
and female,’ and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his
father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become
one flesh’? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore
what God has joined together, let man not separate.”</font> </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Why then,” they asked, “did Moses
order a man to give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her
away?” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Moses
permitted you to divorce your wives because of your hardness of
heart; but it was not this way from the beginning. Now I tell you
that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and
marries another woman, commits adultery.”</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Not everyone can
accept this word,”</font> He replied, <font color="#a80000">“but
only those to whom it has been given. For there are eunuchs who were
born that way; others were made that way by men; and still others
live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who
can accept this should accept it.”</font> </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the little children were brought to
Jesus for Him to place His hands on them and pray for them. And the

kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”</font> And after He
