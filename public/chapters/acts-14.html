<font ><b>The Visit to Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At Iconium, Paul and Barnabas went as
usual into the Jewish synagogue, where they spoke so well that a
great number of Jews and Greeks believed. But the unbelieving Jews
stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the
brothers. So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there,
speaking boldly for the Lord, who affirmed the message of His grace
by enabling them to perform signs and wonders. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The people of the city were divided. Some
sided with the Jews, and others with the apostles. But when the
Gentiles and Jews, together with their rulers, set out to mistreat
and stone them, they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian
cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding region, where they
continued to preach the gospel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In Lystra there sat a man crippled in his
feet, who was lame from birth and had never walked. This man was
listening to the words of Paul, who looked intently at him and saw
that he had faith to be healed. In a loud voice Paul called out,
“Stand up on your feet!” And the man jumped up and began to walk.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the crowds saw what Paul had done,
they lifted up their voices in the Lycaonian language: “The gods
have come down to us in human form!” Barnabas they called Zeus, and
Paul they called Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. The priest
of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and
wreaths to the city gates, hoping to offer a sacrifice along with the
crowds. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul
found out about this, they tore their clothes and rushed into the
crowd, shouting, “Men, why are you doing this? We too are only men,
human like you. We are bringing you good news that you should turn
from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and
earth and sea and everything in them. In past generations, He let all
nations go their own way. Yet He has not left Himself without
testimony to His goodness: He gives you rain from heaven and fruitful
seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Even with these words, Paul and Barnabas
could hardly stop the crowds from sacrificing to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and
Iconium and won over the crowds. They stoned Paul and dragged him
outside the city, presuming he was dead. But after the disciples had
gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. And the
next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They preached the gospel to that city and
made many disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and
Antioch, strengthening the souls of the disciples and encouraging
them to continue in the faith. “We must endure many hardships to
enter the kingdom of God,” they said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for
them in each church, praying and fasting as they entrusted them to
the Lord, in whom they had believed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After passing through Pisidia, they came
to Pamphylia. And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went
down to Attalia. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From Attalia they sailed to Antioch, where
they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had
just completed. When they arrived, they gathered the church together
and reported all that God had done through them, and how He had
opened the door of faith to the Gentiles. And they spent a long time
there with the disciples. </font>
