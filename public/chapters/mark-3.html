<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals on the Sabbath<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 12:9–14; Luke 6:6–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Once again Jesus entered the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there.
<span class="reftext">2</span>In order to accuse Jesus, they were watching to see if He would heal on the Sabbath.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, <span>“Stand up among us.”</span>
<span class="reftext">4</span>And He asked them, <span>“Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> But they were silent.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Jesus looked around at them with anger and sorrow at their hardness of heart. Then He said to the man, <span>“Stretch out your hand.”</span> So he stretched it out, and it was restored.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>At this, the Pharisees went out and began plotting with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals the Multitudes<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 4:23–25; Luke 6:17–19)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>So Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, accompanied by a large crowd from Galilee, Judea,
<span class="reftext">8</span>Jerusalem, Idumea, the region beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon. The large crowd came to Him when they heard what great things He was doing.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Jesus asked His disciples to have a boat ready for Him so that the crowd would not crush Him.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For He had healed so many that all who had diseases were pressing forward to touch Him.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And when the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and cried out, “You are the Son of God!”
<span class="reftext">12</span>But He warned them sternly not to make Him known.
</p><p class="hdg">The Twelve Apostles<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 10:1–4; Luke 6:12–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then Jesus went up on the mountain and called for those He wanted, and they came to Him.
<span class="reftext">14</span>He appointed twelve of them, whom He designated as apostles,<span class="fn">a</span>  to accompany Him, to be sent out to preach,
<span class="reftext">15</span>and to have authority to drive out demons.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>These are the twelve He appointed: Simon (whom He named Peter),
<span class="reftext">17</span>James son of Zebedee and his brother John (whom He named Boanerges, meaning “Sons of Thunder”),
<span class="reftext">18</span>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">19</span>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">A House Divided<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 12:22–30; Luke 11:14–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then Jesus went home,<span class="fn">d</span>  and once again a crowd gathered, so that He and His disciples could not even eat.
<span class="reftext">21</span>When His family heard about this, they went out to take custody of Him, saying, “He is out of His mind.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,<span class="fn">e</span>” and, “By the prince of the demons He drives out demons.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables: <span>“How can Satan drive out Satan?
<span class="reftext">24</span>If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand.
<span class="reftext">25</span>If a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And if Satan is divided and rises against himself, he cannot stand; his end has come.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Indeed, no one can enter a strong man’s house to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Unpardonable Sin<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 12:31–32)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>Truly I tell you, the sons of men will be forgiven all sins and blasphemies, as many as they utter.
<span class="reftext">29</span>But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of eternal sin.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Jesus made this statement because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus’ Mother and Brothers<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 12:46–50; Luke 8:19–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came and stood outside. They sent someone in to summon Him,
<span class="reftext">32</span>and a crowd was sitting around Him. “Look,” He was told, “Your mother and brothers<span class="fn">f</span>  are outside, asking for You.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>But Jesus replied, <span>“Who are My mother and My brothers?”</span>
<span class="reftext">34</span>Looking at those seated in a circle around Him, He said, <span>“Here are My mother and My brothers!
<span class="reftext">35</span>For whoever does the will of God is My brother and sister and mother.”</span></p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> SBL, NE, BYZ, and TR do not include <i class="calibre6">whom He designated as apostles</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">Simon the Cananean</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">who also betrayed Him</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Then He comes to a house</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> WH <i class="calibre6">Beezeboul</i>; Vulgate <i class="calibre6">Beelzebub</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">32</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> NE and NA include <i class="calibre6">and Your sisters</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
