<font ><b>The Twelve Apostles</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once again Jesus entered the synagogue,
and a man with a withered hand was there. In order to accuse Jesus,
they were watching to see if He would heal on the Sabbath. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to the man with the
withered hand, <font color="#a80000">“Stand up among us.”</font>
And He asked them, <font color="#a80000">“Which is lawful on the
Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But they were silent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus looked around at them with anger and
sorrow at their hardness of heart. Then He said to the man, <font color="#a80000">“Stretch
out your hand.”</font> So he stretched it out, and it was restored.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, the Pharisees went out and began
plotting with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jesus withdrew with His disciples to
the sea, accompanied by a large crowd from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem,
Idumea, the region beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and
Sidon. The large crowd came to Him when they heard what great things
He was doing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus asked His disciples to have a boat
ready for Him so that the crowd would not crush Him. For He had
healed so many that all who had diseases were pressing forward to
touch Him. And when the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down
before Him and cried out, “You are the Son of God!” But He warned
them sternly not to make Him known. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus went up on the mountain and
called for those He wanted, and they came to Him. He appointed twelve
of them, whom He designated as apostles, to accompany Him, to be sent
out to preach, and to have authority to drive out demons. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These are the twelve He appointed: Simon
(whom He named Peter), James son of Zebedee and his brother John
(whom He named Boanerges, meaning “Sons of Thunder”), Andrew,
Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus,
Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus went home, and once again a
crowd gathered, so that He and His disciples could not even eat. When
His family heard about this, they went out to take custody of Him,
saying, “He is out of His mind.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the scribes who had come down from
Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “By
the prince of the demons He drives out demons.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jesus called them together and began to
speak to them in parables: <font color="#a80000">“How can Satan
drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot
stand. If a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand. And if
Satan is divided and rises against himself, he cannot stand; his end
has come. Indeed, no one can enter a strong man’s house to steal
his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can
plunder his house.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Truly I tell you,
the sons of men will be forgiven all sins and blasphemies, as many as
they utter. But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never
be forgiven; he is guilty of eternal sin.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus made this statement because they
were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came and
stood outside. They sent someone in to summon Him, and a crowd was
sitting around Him. “Look,” He was told, “Your mother and
brothers are outside, asking for You.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Who
are My mother and My brothers?”</font> Looking at those seated in a
circle around Him, He said, <font color="#a80000">“Here are My
mother and My brothers! For whoever does the will of God is My
brother and sister and mother.”</font> </font>
