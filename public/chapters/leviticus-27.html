<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
the Israelites and say to them, ‘When someone makes a special vow
to the LORD involving the value of persons, if the valuation concerns
a male from twenty to sixty years of age, then your valuation shall
be fifty shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel. Or if
it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels. And if
the person is from five to twenty years of age, then your valuation
for the male shall be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if the person is from one month to
five years of age, then your valuation for the male shall be five
shekels of silver, and for the female three shekels of silver. And if
the person is sixty years of age or older, then your valuation shall
be fifteen shekels for the male and ten shekels for the female. But
if the one making the vow is too poor to pay the valuation, he is to
present the person before the priest, who shall set the value
according to what the one making the vow can afford. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If he vows an animal that may be brought
as an offering to the LORD, any such animal given to the LORD shall
be holy. He must not replace it or exchange it, either good for bad
or bad for good. But if he does substitute one animal for another,
both that animal and its substitute will be holy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if the vow involves any of the unclean
animals that may not be brought as an offering to the LORD, the
animal must be presented before the priest. The priest shall set its
value, whether high or low; as the priest values it, the price will
be set. If, however, the owner decides to redeem the animal, he must
add a fifth to its value. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if a man consecrates his house as holy
to the LORD, then the priest shall value it either as good or bad.
The price will stand just as the priest values it. But if he who
consecrated his house redeems it, he must add a fifth to the assessed
value, and it will belong to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If a man consecrates to the LORD a parcel
of his land, then your valuation shall be proportional to the seed
required for it—fifty shekels of silver for every homer of barley
seed. If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the
price will stand according to your valuation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if he consecrates his field after the
Jubilee, the priest is to calculate the price in proportion to the
years left until the next Year of Jubilee, so that your valuation
will be reduced. And if the one who consecrated the field decides to
redeem it, he must add a fifth to the assessed value, and it shall
belong to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If, however, he does not redeem the field,
or if he has sold it to another man, it may no longer be redeemed.
When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like
a field devoted to the LORD; it becomes the property of the priests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if a man consecrates to the LORD a
field he has purchased, which is not a part of his own property, then
the priest shall calculate for him the value up to the Year of
Jubilee, and the man shall pay the assessed value on that day as a
sacred offering to the LORD. In the Year of Jubilee the field shall
return to the one from whom it was bought—the original owner of the
land. Every valuation will be according to the sanctuary shekel,
twenty gerahs to the shekel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But no one may consecrate a firstborn of
the livestock, because a firstborn belongs to the LORD. Whether it is
an ox or a sheep, it is the LORD’s. But if it is among the unclean
animals, then he may redeem it according to your valuation and add a
fifth of its value. If it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold
according to your valuation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nothing that a man sets apart to the LORD
from all he owns—whether a man, an animal, or his inherited
land—can be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to
the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >No person set apart for destruction may be
ransomed; he must surely be put to death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus any tithe from the land, whether from
the seed of the land or the fruit of the trees, belongs to the LORD;
it is holy to the LORD. If a man wishes to redeem part of his tithe,
he must add a fifth to its value. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Every tenth animal from the herd or flock
that passes under the shepherd’s rod will be holy to the LORD. He
must not inspect whether it is good or bad, and he shall not make any
substitution. But if he does make a substitution, both the animal and
its substitute shall become holy; they cannot be redeemed.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
