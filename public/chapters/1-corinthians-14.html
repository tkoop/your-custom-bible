<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Prophecy and Tongues</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Earnestly pursue love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries in the Spirit.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, encouragement, and comfort.
<span class="reftext">4</span>The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>I wish that all of you could speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets so that the church may be edified.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?
<span class="reftext">7</span>Even in the case of lifeless instruments, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone recognize the tune they are playing unless the notes are distinct?
<span class="reftext">8</span>Again, if the trumpet sounds a muffled call, who will prepare for battle?
<span class="reftext">9</span>So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Assuredly, there are many different languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.
<span class="reftext">11</span>If, then, I do not know the meaning of someone’s language, I am a foreigner<span class="fn">a</span>  to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>It is the same with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, strive to excel in gifts that build up the church.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore, the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.
<span class="reftext">14</span>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>What then shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Otherwise, if you speak a blessing in spirit,<span class="fn">b</span>  how can someone who is uninstructed say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?
<span class="reftext">17</span>You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other one is not edified.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But in the church, I would rather speak five coherent words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature.
<span class="reftext">21</span>It is written in the Law: </p><p class="indent1stline">“By strange tongues and foreign lips </p><p class="indent"> I will speak to this people, </p><p class="indent1"> but even then they will not listen to Me, </p><p class="indent"> says the Lord.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who are uninstructed or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds?
<span class="reftext">24</span>But if an unbeliever or uninstructed person comes in while everyone is prophesying, he will be convicted and called to account by all,
<span class="reftext">25</span>and the secrets of his heart will be made known. So he will fall facedown and worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among you!”
</p><p class="hdg">Orderly Worship</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a psalm or a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. All of these must be done to build up the church.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>If anyone speaks in a tongue, two, or at most three, should speak in turn, and someone must interpret.
<span class="reftext">28</span>But if there is no interpreter, he should remain silent in the church and speak only to himself and God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.
<span class="reftext">30</span>And if a revelation comes to someone who is seated, the first speaker should stop.
<span class="reftext">31</span>For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.
<span class="reftext">32</span>The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.
<span class="reftext">33</span>For God is not a God of disorder, but of peace—as in all the churches of the saints.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Women are to be silent in the churches. They are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says.
<span class="reftext">35</span>If they wish to inquire about something, they are to ask their own husbands at home; for it is dishonourable for a woman to speak in the church.<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached?
<span class="reftext">37</span>If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, let him acknowledge that what I am writing you is the Lord’s command.
<span class="reftext">38</span>But if anyone ignores this, he himself will be ignored.<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>So, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
<span class="reftext">40</span>But everything must be done in a proper and orderly manner.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">a barbarian</i>; twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the Spirit</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Isaiah 28:11–12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">of peace.
