<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Prophecy and Tongues</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Earnestly pursue love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries in the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But he who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, encouragement, and comfort.
<span class="reftext">4</span>The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>I wish that all of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> could speak in tongues, but I would rather have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets so that the church may be edified.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Now, brothers, if I come to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> speaking in tongues, how will I benefit <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, unless I bring <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?
<span class="reftext">7</span>Even in the case of lifeless instruments, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone <span class='spell ca'>recognize</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognize</span> the tune they are playing unless the notes are distinct?
<span class="reftext">8</span>Again, if the trumpet sounds a muffled call, who will prepare for battle?
<span class="reftext">9</span>So it is with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. Unless <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> will just be speaking into the air.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Assuredly, there are many different languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.
<span class="reftext">11</span>If, then, I do not know the meaning of someone’s language, I am a foreigner<span class="fn">a</span>  to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>It is the same with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. Since <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are eager to have spiritual gifts, strive to excel in gifts that build up the church.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore, the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.
<span class="reftext">14</span>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>What then shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Otherwise, if you speak a blessing in spirit,<span class="fn">b</span>  how can someone who is uninstructed say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?
<span class="reftext">17</span>You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other one is not edified.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But in the church, I would rather speak five coherent words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> thinking be mature.
<span class="reftext">21</span>It is written in the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span>: </p><p class="indent1stline">“By strange tongues and foreign lips </p><p class="indent"> I will speak to this people, </p><p class="indent1"> but even then they will not listen to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, </p><p class="indent"> says the Lord.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who are uninstructed or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are out of your minds?
<span class="reftext">24</span>But if an unbeliever or uninstructed person comes in while everyone is prophesying, he will be convicted and called to account by all,
<span class="reftext">25</span>and the secrets of his heart will be made known. So he will fall facedown and worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>!”
</p><p class="hdg">Orderly Worship</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>What then shall we say, brothers? When <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> come together, everyone has a psalm or a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. All of these must be done to build up the church.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>If anyone speaks in a tongue, two, or at most three, should speak in turn, and someone must interpret.
<span class="reftext">28</span>But if there is no interpreter, he should remain silent in the church and speak only to himself and God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.
<span class="reftext">30</span>And if a revelation comes to someone who is seated, the first speaker should stop.
<span class="reftext">31</span>For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.
<span class="reftext">32</span>The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.
<span class="reftext">33</span>For God is not a God of disorder, but of peace—as in all the churches of the saints.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Women are to be silent in the churches. They are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says.
<span class="reftext">35</span>If they wish to inquire about something, they are to ask their own husbands at home; for it is <span class='spell ca'>dishonourable</span><span class='spell gb'>dishonourable</span><span class='spell us'>dishonorable</span> for a woman to speak in the church.<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Did the word of God originate with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>? Or are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> the only ones it has reached?
<span class="reftext">37</span>If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, let him acknowledge that what I am writing <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> is the Lord’s command.
<span class="reftext">38</span>But if anyone ignores this, he himself will be ignored.<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>So, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
<span class="reftext">40</span>But everything must be done in a proper and orderly manner.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">a barbarian</i>; twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the Spirit</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Isaiah 28:11–12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">of peace.
