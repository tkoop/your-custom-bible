<font ><b>Prophecy, Tongues, and Worship</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Earnestly pursue love and eagerly desire
spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. For he who speaks
in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God. Indeed, no one
understands him; he utters mysteries in the Spirit. But he who
prophesies speaks to men for their edification, encouragement, and
comfort. The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one
who prophesies edifies the church. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I wish that all of you could speak in
tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is
greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets so that
the church may be edified. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking
in tongues, how will I benefit you, unless I bring you some
revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? Even in the case of
lifeless instruments, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone
recognize the tune they are playing unless the notes are distinct?
Again, if the trumpet sounds a muffled call, who will prepare for
battle? So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with
your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just
be speaking into the air. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Assuredly, there are many different
languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. If,
then, I do not know the meaning of someone’s language, I am a
foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >It is the same with you. Since you are
eager to have spiritual gifts, strive to excel in gifts that build up
the church. Therefore, the one who speaks in a tongue should pray
that he may interpret. For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays,
but my mind is unfruitful. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >What then shall I do? I will pray with my
spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my
spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. Otherwise, if you speak a
blessing in spirit, how can someone who is uninstructed say “Amen”
to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying? You
may be giving thanks well enough, but the other one is not edified. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I thank God that I speak in tongues more
than all of you. But in the church, I would rather speak five
coherent words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a
tongue. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Brothers, stop thinking like children. In
regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature. It is
written in the Law: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >By strange tongues and foreign lips </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will speak to this people, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >but even then they will not listen to Me, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >says the Lord.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Tongues, then, are a sign, not for
believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is for believers,
not for unbelievers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So if the whole church comes together and
everyone speaks in tongues, and some who are uninstructed or some
unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your
minds? But if an unbeliever or uninstructed person comes in while
everyone is prophesying, he will be convicted and called to account
by all, and the secrets of his heart will be made known. So he will
fall facedown and worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among
you!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >What then shall we say, brothers? When you
come together, everyone has a psalm or a teaching, a revelation, a
tongue, or an interpretation. All of these must be done to build up
the church. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If anyone speaks in a tongue, two, or at
most three, should speak in turn, and someone must interpret. But if
there is no interpreter, he should remain silent in the church and
speak only to himself and God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Two or three prophets should speak, and
the others should weigh carefully what is said. And if a revelation
comes to someone who is seated, the first speaker should stop. For
you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and
encouraged. The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. For God
is not a God of disorder, but of peace—as in all the churches of
the saints. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Women are to be silent in the churches.
They are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, as the
law says. If they wish to inquire about something, they are to ask
their own husbands at home; for it is dishonorable for a woman to
speak in the church. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Did the word of God originate with you? Or
are you the only ones it has reached? If anyone considers himself a
prophet or spiritual person, let him acknowledge that what I am
writing you is the Lord’s command. But if anyone ignores this, he
himself will be ignored. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and
do not forbid speaking in tongues. But everything must be done in a
proper and orderly manner. </font>
