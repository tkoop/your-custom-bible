<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">David Again Spares Saul</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hachilah, opposite Jeshimon?”
<span class="reftext">2</span>So Saul, accompanied by three thousand chosen men of Israel, went down to the <span class='cap'>Wilderness</span><span class='nocap'>wilderness</span> of Ziph to search for David there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Saul camped beside the road at the hill of Hachilah opposite Jeshimon, but David was living in the wilderness. When he <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that Saul had followed him there,
<span class="reftext">4</span>David sent out spies to verify that Saul had arrived.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general of his army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the inner circle of the camp, with the troops camped around him.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” </p><p class="reg1">“I will go with you,” answered Abishai.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>That night David and Abishai came to the troops, and Saul was lying there asleep in the inner circle of the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and the troops were lying around him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand. Now, therefore, please let me thrust the spear through him into the ground with one stroke. I will not need to strike him twice!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>But David said to Abishai, “Do not destroy him, for who can lift a hand against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s anointed and be guiltless?”
<span class="reftext">10</span>David added, “As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> will strike him down; either his day will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.
<span class="reftext">11</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> forbid that I should stretch out my hand against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s anointed. Instead, take the spear and water jug by his head, and let us go.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So David took the spear and water jug by Saul’s head, and they departed. No one saw them or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up; they all remained asleep, because a deep sleep from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had fallen on them.
</p><p class="hdg">David Reproves Abner</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then David crossed to the other side and stood atop the mountain at a distance; there was a wide gulf between them.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner, “Will you not answer me, Abner?” </p><p class="reg1">“Who calls to the king?” Abner replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So David said to Abner, “You are a man, aren’t you? And who in Israel is your equal? Why then did you not protect your lord the king when one of the people came to destroy him?
<span class="reftext">16</span>This thing you have done is not good. As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives, all of you deserve to die, since you did not protect your lord, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s anointed. Now look around. Where are the king’s spear and water jug that were by his head?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then Saul <span class='spell ca'>recognized</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognized</span> David’s voice and asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” </p><p class="reg1">“It is my voice, my lord and king,” David said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And he continued, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done? What evil is in my hand?
<span class="reftext">19</span>Now please, may my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has stirred you up against me, then may <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> accept an offering. But if men have done it, may they be cursed in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>! For today they have driven me away from sharing in the inheritance of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’
<span class="reftext">20</span>So do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. For the king of Israel has come out to look for a flea, like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.”
</p><p class="hdg">Saul Acknowledges His Sin</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then Saul replied, “I have sinned. Come back, David my son. I will never harm you again, because today you considered my life precious. I have played the fool and have committed a grave error!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>“Here is the king’s spear,” David answered. “Let one of the young men come over and get it.
<span class="reftext">23</span>May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> repay every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> delivered you into my hand today, but I would not stretch out my hand against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s anointed.
<span class="reftext">24</span>As surely as I valued your life today, so may <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> value my life and rescue me from all trouble.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Saul said to him, “May you be blessed, David my son. You will accomplish great things and will surely prevail.” </p><p class="reg1"> So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
