<font ><b>David Again Spares Saul</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah
and said, “Is not David hiding on the hill of Hachilah, opposite
Jeshimon?” So Saul, accompanied by three thousand chosen men of
Israel, went down to the Wilderness of Ziph to search for David
there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Saul camped beside the road at the hill of
Hachilah opposite Jeshimon, but David was living in the wilderness.
When he realized that Saul had followed him there, David sent out
spies to verify that Saul had arrived. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David set out and went to the place
where Saul had camped. He saw the place where Saul and Abner son of
Ner, the general of his army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside
the inner circle of the camp, with the troops camped around him. And
David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s
brother, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I will go with you,” answered
Abishai. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That night David and Abishai came to the
troops, and Saul was lying there asleep in the inner circle of the
camp, with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. And Abner and
the troops were lying around him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Abishai said to David, “Today God has
delivered your enemy into your hand. Now, therefore, please let me
thrust the spear through him into the ground with one stroke. I will
not need to strike him twice!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But David said to Abishai, “Do not
destroy him, for who can lift a hand against the LORD’s anointed
and be guiltless?” David added, “As surely as the LORD lives, the
LORD Himself will strike him down; either his day will come and he
will die, or he will go into battle and perish. But the LORD forbid
that I should stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed.
Instead, take the spear and water jug by his head, and let us go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David took the spear and water jug by
Saul’s head, and they departed. No one saw them or knew about it,
nor did anyone wake up; they all remained asleep, because a deep
sleep from the LORD had fallen on them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David crossed to the other side and
stood atop the mountain at a distance; there was a wide gulf between
them. And David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner, “Will
you not answer me, Abner?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Who calls to the king?” Abner
replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David said to Abner, “You are a man,
aren’t you? And who in Israel is your equal? Why then did you not
protect your lord the king when one of the people came to destroy
him? This thing you have done is not good. As surely as the LORD
lives, all of you deserve to die, since you did not protect your
lord, the LORD’s anointed. Now look around. Where are the king’s
spear and water jug that were by his head?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Saul recognized David’s voice and
asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >It is my voice, my lord and king,”
David said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And he continued, “Why is my lord
pursuing his servant? What have I done? What evil is in my hand? Now
please, may my lord the king hear the words of his servant: If the
LORD has stirred you up against me, then may He accept an offering.
But if men have done it, may they be cursed in the presence of the
LORD! For today they have driven me away from sharing in the
inheritance of the LORD, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’ So do
not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the
LORD. For the king of Israel has come out to look for a flea, like
one who hunts a partridge in the mountains.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Saul replied, “I have sinned. Come
back, David my son. I will never harm you again, because today you
considered my life precious. I have played the fool and have
committed a grave error!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Here is the king’s spear,” David
answered. “Let one of the young men come over and get it. May the
LORD repay every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. For the
LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I would not stretch out my
hand against the LORD’s anointed. As surely as I valued your life
today, so may the LORD value my life and rescue me from all trouble.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Saul said to him, “May you be blessed,
David my son. You will accomplish great things and will surely
prevail.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David went on his way, and Saul
returned home. </font>
