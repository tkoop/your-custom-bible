<font ><b>The Four Chariots, Crown, and Temple</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And again I lifted up my eyes and saw four
chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze.
The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, the third
white horses, and the fourth dappled horses—all of them strong. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I inquired of the angel who was
speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the angel told me, “These are the
four spirits of heaven, going forth from their station before the
Lord of all the earth. The one with the black horses is going toward
the land of the north, the one with the white horses toward the west,
and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the strong horses went out, they were
eager to go and patrol the earth; and the LORD said, “Go and patrol
the earth.” So they patrolled the earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD summoned me and said,
“Behold, those going to the land of the north have given rest to My
Spirit in the land of the north.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The word of the LORD also came to me,
saying, “Take an offering from the exiles—from Heldai, Tobijah,
and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon—and go that same day to
the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah. Take silver and gold, make an
ornate crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son
of Jehozadak. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you are to tell him that this is what
the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Here is a man whose name is the Branch,
and He will branch out from His place and build the temple of the
LORD. Yes, He will build the temple of the LORD; He will be clothed
in splendor and will sit on His throne and rule. And He will be a
priest on His throne, and there will be peaceful counsel between the
two.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The crown will reside in the temple of the
LORD as a memorial to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and the gracious son
of Zephaniah. Even those far away will come and build the temple of
the LORD, and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to
you. This will happen if you diligently obey the voice of the LORD
your God.” </font>
