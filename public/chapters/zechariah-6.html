<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Vision of the Four Chariots</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>And again I lifted up my eyes and saw four chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze.
<span class="reftext">2</span>The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses,
<span class="reftext">3</span>the third white horses, and the fourth dappled horses—all of them strong.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So I inquired of the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the angel told me, “These are the four spirits<span class="fn">a</span>  of heaven, going forth from their station before the Lord of all the earth.
<span class="reftext">6</span>The one with the black horses is going toward the land of the north, the one with the white horses toward the west,<span class="fn">b</span>  and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>As the strong horses went out, they were eager to go and patrol the earth; and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, “Go and patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> summoned me and said, “Behold, those going to the land of the north have given rest to My Spirit in the land of the north.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Crown and the Temple</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> also came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">10</span>“Take an offering from the exiles—from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon—and go that same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And you are to tell him that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: ‘Here is a man whose name is the Branch, and He will branch out from His place and build the temple of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Yes, He will build the temple of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>; He will be clothed in <span class='spell ca'>splendour</span><span class='spell gb'>splendour</span><span class='spell us'>splendor</span> and will sit on His throne and rule. And He will be a priest on His throne,<span class="fn">d</span>  and there will be peaceful counsel between the two.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The crown will reside in the temple of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> as a memorial to Helem,<span class="fn">e</span>  Tobijah, Jedaiah, and the gracious<span class="fn">f</span>  son of Zephaniah.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Even those far away will come and build the temple of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and you will know that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts has sent Me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">winds</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the one with the white horses after them</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Jehozadak</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jozadak</i>; see Ezra 3:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">And there will be a priest on His throne</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew; Syriac <i class="calibre6">Heldai</i>; see verse 10.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">and Hen</i>; Syriac <i class="calibre6">and Josiah</i>; see verse 10.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
