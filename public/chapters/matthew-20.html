<font color="#a80000">“<font >For the kingdom
of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to
hire workers for his vineyard. He agreed to pay them a denarius for
the day and sent them into his vineyard. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >About the third hour
he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.
‘You also go into my vineyard,’ he said, ‘and I will pay you
whatever is right.’ So they went. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >He went out again
about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >About the eleventh
hour he went out and found still others standing around. ‘Why have
you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’ he asked. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Because no one
has hired us,’ they answered. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >So he told them,
‘You also go into my vineyard.’ </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >When evening came,
the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers
and pay them their wages, starting with the last ones hired and
moving on to the first.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The workers who were
hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius. So
when the original workers came, they assumed they would receive more.
But each of them also received a denarius. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >On receiving their
pay, they began to grumble against the landowner. ‘These men who
were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you have
made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching
heat of the day.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But he answered one
of them, ‘Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Did you not agree
with me on one denarius? Take your pay and go. I want to give this
last man the same as I gave you. Do I not have the right to do as I
please with what is mine? Or are you envious because I am generous?’

<font >As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He
took the twelve disciples aside and said, <font color="#a80000">“Look,
we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered
over to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn Him to death
and will deliver Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged
and crucified. And on the third day He will be raised to life.”</font>

<font >Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came
to Jesus with her sons and knelt down to make a request of Him. </font>

<font >When the ten heard about this, they were
indignant with the two brothers. But Jesus called them aside and
said, <font color="#a80000">“You know that the rulers of the
Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors exercise authority
over them. It shall not be this way among you. Instead, whoever wants
to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to
be first among you must be your slave— just as the Son of Man did
not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom
for many.”</font> </font>

<font >As they were leaving Jericho, a large
crowd followed Him. And there were two blind men sitting beside the
road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out,

“<font >Lord,” they answered, “let our eyes

eyes, and at once they received their sight and followed Him. </font>
