<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Eastern Tribes Return Home</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh
<span class="reftext">2</span>and told them, “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have done all that Moses the servant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> commanded <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">3</span>All this time <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have not deserted <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers, up to this very day, but have kept the charge given you by <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And now that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God has given <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers rest as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> promised them, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may return to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> homes in the land that Moses the servant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gave <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> across the Jordan.
<span class="reftext">5</span>But be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gave you: to love <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God, to walk in all <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> ways, to keep <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> commandments, to hold fast to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, and to serve <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> with all your heart and with all your soul.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So Joshua blessed them and sent them on their way, and they went to their homes.
<span class="reftext">7</span>(To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan, and to the other half Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan among their brothers.) When Joshua sent them to their homes he blessed them,
<span class="reftext">8</span>saying, “Return to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> homes with <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> great wealth, with immense herds of livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and very many clothes. Divide with <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers the spoil of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> enemies.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Altar of Witness</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in the land of Canaan to return to their own land of Gilead, which they had acquired according to the command of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> through Moses.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And when they came to Geliloth<span class="fn">a</span>  near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then the Israelites received the report: “Behold, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the border of the land of Canaan, at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side.”
<span class="reftext">12</span>And when they heard this, the whole congregation of Israel assembled at Shiloh to go to war against them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>The Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the land of Gilead, to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
<span class="reftext">14</span>With him they sent ten chiefs—one family leader from each tribe of Israel, each the head of a family among the clans of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>They went to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead and said to them,
<span class="reftext">16</span>“This is what the whole congregation of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘What is this breach of faith you have committed today against the God of Israel by turning away from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and building for yourselves an altar, that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> might rebel against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> this day?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Was not the sin of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day? It even brought a plague upon the congregation of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And now, would <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> turn away from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>? If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> rebel today against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, tomorrow <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>If indeed the land of your inheritance is unclean, then cross over to the land of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s possession, where <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s tabernacle stands, and take possession of it among us. But do not rebel against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> or against us by building for yourselves an altar other than the altar of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Was not Achan<span class="fn">b</span>  son of Zerah unfaithful regarding what was set apart for destruction,<span class="fn">c</span>  bringing wrath upon the whole congregation of Israel? Yet it was not only Achan who perished because of his sin!’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the leaders of the clans of Israel:
<span class="reftext">22</span>“<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span>, the <span class='cap'>Mighty</span><span class='nocap'>mighty</span> <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span>, is God! <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span>, the <span class='cap'>Mighty</span><span class='nocap'>mighty</span> <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span>, is God! He knows, and may Israel also know. If this was in rebellion or breach of faith against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, do not spare us today.
<span class="reftext">23</span>If we have built for ourselves an altar to turn away from <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings on it, or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it, may <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> hold us accountable.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>But in fact we have done this for fear that in the future <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> descendants might say to ours, ‘What have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to do with <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel?
<span class="reftext">25</span>For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has made the Jordan a border between us and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> Reubenites and Gadites. <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have no share in <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>!’ So <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> descendants could cause ours to stop fearing <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>That is why we said, ‘Let us take action and build an altar for ourselves, but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Rather, let it be a witness between us and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and the generations to come, that we will worship <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> presence with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings.’ Then in the future, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> descendants cannot say to ours, ‘<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have no share in <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>!’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Therefore we said, ‘If they ever say this to us or to our descendants, we will answer: Look at the replica of the altar of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> that our fathers made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but as a witness between us and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Far be it from us to rebel against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and turn away from <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> today by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices, other than the altar of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God, which stands before <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> tabernacle.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>When Phinehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation—the heads of Israel’s clans who were with him—heard what the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh had to say, they were satisfied.
<span class="reftext">31</span>Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest said to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, “Today we know that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is among us, because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have not committed this breach of faith against <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. Consequently, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have delivered the Israelites from the hand of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Then Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, together with the other leaders, returned to the Israelites in the land of Canaan and brought back a report regarding the Reubenites and Gadites in the land of Gilead.
<span class="reftext">33</span>The Israelites were satisfied with the report, and they blessed God and spoke no more about going to war against them to destroy the land where the Reubenites and Gadites lived.
<span class="reftext">34</span>So the Reubenites and Gadites named the altar Witness, for they said,<span class="fn">d</span>  “It is a witness between us that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is God.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">to the circle of stones</i> or <i class="calibre6">to the region</i>; similarly in verse 11<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Achan</i> means <i class="calibre6">troubler</i>; also called <i class="calibre6">Achar</i> in 1 Chronicles 2:7.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">cherem</i> refer to the giving over of things or persons to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">34</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">named the altar, for</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
