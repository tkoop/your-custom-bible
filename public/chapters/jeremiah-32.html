<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jeremiah Buys Hanamel’s Field</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
<span class="reftext">2</span>At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard, which was in the palace of the king of Judah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying: “Why are you prophesying like this? You claim that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says, ‘Behold, I am about to deliver this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the hands of the Chaldeans,<span class="fn">a</span>  but he will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye.
<span class="reftext">5</span>He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will stay until I attend to him, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Jeremiah replied, “The word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying:
<span class="reftext">7</span>Behold! Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, is coming to you to say, ‘Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy it.’
<span class="reftext">8</span>Then, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and urged me, ‘Please buy my field in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for you own the right of inheritance and redemption. Buy it for yourself.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1"> Then I knew that this was the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out seventeen shekels of silver.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">10</span>I signed and sealed the deed, called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Then I took the deed of purchase—the sealed copy with its terms and conditions, as well as the open copy—
<span class="reftext">12</span>and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of my cousin Hanamel and the witnesses who were signing the purchase agreement and all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>In their sight I instructed Baruch,
<span class="reftext">14</span>“This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Take these deeds—both the sealed copy and the open copy of the deed of purchase—and put them in a clay jar to preserve them for a long time.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jeremiah Prays for Understanding</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>:
<span class="reftext">17</span>“Oh, Lord GOD! You have made the heavens and the earth by <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>You show loving devotion to thousands but lay the iniquity of the fathers into the laps<span class="fn">c</span>  of their children after them, O great and mighty God whose name is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts,
<span class="reftext">19</span>the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are on all the ways of the sons of men, to reward each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>You performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> do so to this very day, both in Israel and among all mankind. And <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have made a name for <span class='cap'>Yourself</span><span class='nocap'>yourself</span>, as is the case to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>You brought <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror.
<span class="reftext">22</span>You gave them this land that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> had sworn to give their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>They came in and possessed it, but they did not obey <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> voice or walk in <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> law. They failed to perform all that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> commanded them to do, and so <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have brought upon them all this disaster.
<span class="reftext">24</span>See how the siege ramps are mounted against the city to capture it. And by sword and famine and plague, the city has been given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have spoken has happened, as <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> now see!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Yet <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>, O Lord GOD, have said to me, ‘Buy for yourself the field with silver and call in witnesses, even though the city has been delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans!’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg"><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> Answers Jeremiah</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Jeremiah:
<span class="reftext">27</span>“Behold, I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of all flesh. Is anything too difficult for <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: Behold, I am about to deliver this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it.
<span class="reftext">29</span>And the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will come in, set it on fire, and burn it, along with the houses of those who provoked <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to anger by burning incense to Baal on their rooftops and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>For the children of Israel and of Judah have done nothing but evil in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sight from their youth; indeed, they have done nothing but provoke <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to anger by the work of their hands, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>For this city has aroused <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> wrath and fury from the day it was built until now. Therefore I will remove it from <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> presence
<span class="reftext">32</span>because of all the evil the children of Israel and of Judah have done to provoke <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to anger—they, their kings, their officials, their priests and prophets, the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">33</span>They have turned their backs to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and not their faces. Though I taught them again and again,<span class="fn">d</span>  they would not listen or respond to discipline.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>They have placed their abominations in the house that bears <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Name</span><span class='nocap'>name</span>, and so have defiled it.
<span class="reftext">35</span>They have built the high places of Baal in the <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span> of Hinnom to make their sons and daughters pass through the fire to Molech—something I never commanded them, nor had it ever entered <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> mind, that they should commit such an abomination and cause Judah to sin.

<span class="reftext">37</span>I will surely gather <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people from all the lands to which I have banished them in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> furious anger and great wrath, and I will return them to this place and make them dwell in safety.
<span class="reftext">38</span>They will be <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people, and I will be their God.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">39</span>I will give them one heart and one way, so that they will always fear <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> for their own good and for the good of their children after them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never turn away from doing good to them, and I will put <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> fear in their hearts, so that they will never turn away from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
<span class="reftext">41</span>Yes, I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will faithfully plant them in this land with all <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> heart and with all <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> soul.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: Just as I have brought all this great disaster on this people, so I will bring on them all the good I have promised them.
<span class="reftext">43</span>And fields will be bought in this land about which you are saying, ‘It is a desolation, without man or beast; it has been delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans.’
<span class="reftext">44</span>Fields will be purchased with silver, and deeds will be signed, sealed, and witnessed in the land of Benjamin, in the areas surrounding Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah—the cities of the hill country, the foothills,<span class="fn">f</span>  and the Negev—because I will restore them from captivity,<span class="fn">g</span>  declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the Babylonians; also in verses 5, 24, 25, 28, 29, and 43<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">17 shekels</i> is approximately 6.8 ounces or 193.8 grams of silver.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">into the bosom</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">I taught them, rising up early and teaching,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">38</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Cited in 2 Corinthians 6:16<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">44</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Shephelah</i> or <i class="calibre6">lowlands</i>; that is, the western foothills of Judea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">44</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">restore their fortunes</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
