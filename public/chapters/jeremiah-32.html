32</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>A Promise of Restoration</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is the word that came to Jeremiah
from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was
the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. At that time the army of the
king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was
imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard, which was in the palace of
the king of Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned
him, saying: “Why are you prophesying like this? You claim that the
LORD says, ‘Behold, I am about to deliver this city into the hand
of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it. Zedekiah king of
Judah will not escape from the hands of the Chaldeans, but he will
surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and will
speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye. He will take
Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will stay until I attend to him,
declares the LORD. If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not
succeed.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jeremiah replied, “The word of the LORD
came to me, saying: Behold! Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum,
is coming to you to say, ‘Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth,
for you have the right of redemption to buy it.’ Then, as the LORD
had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard
and urged me, ‘Please buy my field in Anathoth in the land of
Benjamin, for you own the right of inheritance and redemption. Buy it
for yourself.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I knew that this was the word of the
LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I bought the field in Anathoth from my
cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out seventeen shekels of silver. I
signed and sealed the deed, called in witnesses, and weighed out the
silver on the scales. Then I took the deed of purchase—the sealed
copy with its terms and conditions, as well as the open copy— and I
gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the
sight of my cousin Hanamel and the witnesses who were signing the
purchase agreement and all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the
guard. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In their sight I instructed Baruch, “This
is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Take these
deeds—both the sealed copy and the open copy of the deed of
purchase—and put them in a clay jar to preserve them for a long
time. For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says:
Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After I had given the deed of purchase to
Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD: “Oh, Lord GOD! You have
made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched
arm. Nothing is too difficult for You! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You show loving devotion to thousands but
lay the iniquity of the fathers into the laps of their children after
them, O great and mighty God whose name is the LORD of Hosts, the One
great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are on all the ways
of the sons of men, to reward each one according to his ways and
according to the fruit of his deeds. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You performed signs and wonders in the
land of Egypt, and You do so to this very day, both in Israel and
among all mankind. And You have made a name for Yourself, as is the
case to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You brought Your people Israel out of the
land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an
outstretched arm, and with great terror. You gave them this land that
You had sworn to give their fathers, a land flowing with milk and
honey. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They came in and possessed it, but they
did not obey Your voice or walk in Your law. They failed to perform
all that You commanded them to do, and so You have brought upon them
all this disaster. See how the siege ramps are mounted against the
city to capture it. And by sword and famine and plague, the city has
been given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against
it. What You have spoken has happened, as You now see! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Yet You, O Lord GOD, have said to me, ‘Buy
for yourself the field with silver and call in witnesses, even though
the city has been delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the word of the LORD came to
Jeremiah: “Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is anything
too difficult for Me? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore this is what the LORD says:
Behold, I am about to deliver this city into the hands of the
Chaldeans and of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it.
And the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will come in,
set it on fire, and burn it, along with the houses of those who
provoked Me to anger by burning incense to Baal on their rooftops and
by pouring out drink offerings to other gods. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the children of Israel and of Judah
have done nothing but evil in My sight from their youth; indeed, they
have done nothing but provoke Me to anger by the work of their hands,
declares the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For this city has aroused My wrath and
fury from the day it was built until now. Therefore I will remove it
from My presence because of all the evil the children of Israel and
of Judah have done to provoke Me to anger—they, their kings, their
officials, their priests and prophets, the men of Judah, and the
residents of Jerusalem. They have turned their backs to Me and not
their faces. Though I taught them again and again, they would not
listen or respond to discipline. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They have placed their abominations in the
house that bears My Name, and so have defiled it. They have built the
high places of Baal in the Valley of Hinnom to make their sons and
daughters pass through the fire to Molech—something I never
commanded them, nor had it ever entered My mind, that they should
commit such an abomination and cause Judah to sin. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now therefore, about this city of which
you say, ‘It will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon
by sword and famine and plague,’ this is what the LORD, the God of
Israel, says: I will surely gather My people from all the lands to
which I have banished them in My furious anger and great wrath, and I
will return them to this place and make them dwell in safety. They
will be My people, and I will be their God. I will give them one
heart and one way, so that they will always fear Me for their own
good and for the good of their children after them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will make an everlasting covenant with
them: I will never turn away from doing good to them, and I will put
My fear in their hearts, so that they will never turn away from Me.
Yes, I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will faithfully plant
them in this land with all My heart and with all My soul. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For this is what the LORD says: Just as I
have brought all this great disaster on this people, so I will bring
on them all the good I have promised them. And fields will be bought
in this land about which you are saying, ‘It is a desolation,
without man or beast; it has been delivered into the hands of the
Chaldeans.’ Fields will be purchased with silver, and deeds will be
signed, sealed, and witnessed in the land of Benjamin, in the areas
surrounding Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah—the cities of the
hill country, the foothills, and the Negev—because I will restore
them from captivity, declares the LORD.” </font>
