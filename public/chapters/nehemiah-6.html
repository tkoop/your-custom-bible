<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Sanballat’s Conspiracy</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left—though to that time I had not yet installed the doors in the gates—
<span class="reftext">2</span>Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages<span class="fn">a</span>  on the plain<span class="fn">b</span>  of Ono.” </p><p class="reg1"> But they were planning to harm me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it to go down to you?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave the same reply.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The fifth time, Sanballat sent me this same message by his young servant, who had in his hand an unsealed letter
<span class="reftext">6</span>that read: </p><p class="tab1stline">“It is reported among the nations—and Geshem<span class="fn">c</span>  agrees—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and this is why you are building the wall. According to these reports, you are to become their king,
<span class="reftext">7</span>and you have even appointed prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf: ‘There is a king in Judah.’ Soon these <span class='spell ca'>rumours</span><span class='spell gb'>rumours</span><span class='spell us'>rumors</span> will reach the ears of the king. So come, let us confer together.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then I sent him this reply: “There is nothing to these <span class='spell ca'>rumours</span><span class='spell gb'>rumours</span><span class='spell us'>rumors</span> you are spreading; you are inventing them in your own mind.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>For they were all trying to frighten us, saying, “Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will never be finished.” </p><p class="reg1"> But now, my God,<span class="fn">d</span>  strengthen my hands.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Later, I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was confined to his house. He said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Let us meet at the house of God </p><p class="indent"> inside the temple. </p><p class="indent1"> Let us shut the temple doors </p><p class="indent"> because they are coming to kill you—</p><p class="indent"> by night they are coming to kill you!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But I replied, “Should a man like me run away? Should one like me go into the temple to save his own life? I will not go!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>I <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that God had not sent him, but that he had uttered this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would sin by doing as he suggested, so they could give me a bad name in order to discredit me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>O my God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done, and also Noadiah the prophetess and the other prophets who tried to intimidate me.
</p><p class="hdg">Completion of the Wall</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So the wall was completed in fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth of Elul.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">16</span>When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and disheartened, for they <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that this task had been accomplished by our God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Also in those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came back to them.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, since he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Moreover, these nobles kept reporting to me Tobiah’s good deeds, and they relayed my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in Kephirim</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the valley</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Gashmu</i>, a variant of <i class="calibre6">Geshem</i>; see verse 1.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">But now</i>; for clarity, <i class="calibre6">my God</i> has been included.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Elul</i> is the sixth month of the Hebrew lunar calendar, usually occurring within the months of August and September.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
