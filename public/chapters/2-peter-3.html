<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Coming Judgment<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Genesis 7:1–24; Jude 1:17–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Beloved, this is now my second letter to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. Both of them are reminders to stir <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to wholesome thinking
<span class="reftext">2</span>by recalling what was foretold by the holy prophets and commanded by our Lord and <span class='cap'>Savior</span><span class='nocap'>savior</span> through <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> apostles.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Most importantly, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>“Where is the promise of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> coming?” they will ask. “Ever since our fathers fell asleep, everything continues as it has from the beginning of creation.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But they deliberately overlook the fact that long ago by God’s word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water,
<span class="reftext">6</span>through which<span class="fn">b</span>  the world of that time perished in the flood.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And by that same word, the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> and destruction of ungodly men.
</p><p class="hdg">The Day of the Lord<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Zephaniah 1:7–18; Malachi 4:1–6; 1 Thessalonians 5:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Beloved, do not let this one thing escape your notice: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">9</span>The Lord is not slow in keeping <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> promise as some understand slowness, but is patient with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>But the <span class='cap'>Day</span><span class='nocap'>day</span> of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar, the elements will be destroyed<span class="fn">d</span>  by fire, and the earth and its works will be laid bare.<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to be? <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> ought to conduct yourselves in holiness and godliness
<span class="reftext">12</span>as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> anticipate and hasten the coming of the day of God, when the heavens will be destroyed by fire and the elements will melt in the heat.
<span class="reftext">13</span>But in keeping with God’s promise, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.
</p><p class="hdg">Final Exhortations</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore, beloved, as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> anticipate these things, make every effort to be found at peace—spotless and blameless in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> sight.<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Consider also that our Lord’s patience brings salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> with the wisdom God gave him.
<span class="reftext">16</span>He writes this way in all his letters,<span class="fn">g</span>  speaking in them about such matters. Some parts of his letters are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort,<span class="fn">h</span>  as they do the rest of the <span class='cap'>Scriptures</span><span class='nocap'>scriptures</span>, to their own destruction.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore, beloved, since <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> already know these things, be on <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> guard so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure standing.
<span class="reftext">18</span>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and <span class='cap'>Savior</span><span class='nocap'>savior</span> Jesus Christ. To <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. </p><p class="reg1"> Amen.<span class="fn">i</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> See Jude 1:18.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> NA <i class="calibre6">through whom</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> See Psalm 90:4.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">dissolved</i>; also in verses 11 and 12.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">will not be found</i>.
