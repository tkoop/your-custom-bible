<font ><b>The Day of the Lord</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Beloved, this is now my second letter to
you. Both of them are reminders to stir you to wholesome thinking by
recalling what was foretold by the holy prophets and commanded by our
Lord and Savior through your apostles. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Most importantly, you must understand that
in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own
evil desires. “Where is the promise of His coming?” they will
ask. “Ever since our fathers fell asleep, everything continues as
it has from the beginning of creation.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But they deliberately overlook the fact
that long ago by God’s word the heavens existed and the earth was
formed out of water and by water, through which the world of that
time perished in the flood. And by that same word, the present
heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of
judgment and destruction of ungodly men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Beloved, do not let this one thing escape
your notice: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a
thousand years are like a day. The Lord is not slow in keeping His
promise as some understand slowness, but is patient with you, not
wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the Day of the Lord will come like a
thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar, the elements will be
destroyed by fire, and the earth and its works will be laid bare. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Since everything will be destroyed in this
way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to conduct
yourselves in holiness and godliness as you anticipate and hasten the
coming of the day of God, when the heavens will be destroyed by fire
and the elements will melt in the heat. But in keeping with God’s
promise, we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth,
where righteousness dwells. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, beloved, as you anticipate
these things, make every effort to be found at peace—spotless and
blameless in His sight. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Consider also that our Lord’s patience
brings salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote you
with the wisdom God gave him. He writes this way in all his letters,
speaking in them about such matters. Some parts of his letters are
hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as
they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, beloved, since you already know
these things, be on your guard so that you will not be carried away
by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure standing. But
grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Amen. </font>
