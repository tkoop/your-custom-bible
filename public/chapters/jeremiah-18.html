<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Potter and the Clay</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>:
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Go down at once to the potter’s house, and there I will reveal <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> message to you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So I went down to the potter’s house and saw him working at the wheel.
<span class="reftext">4</span>But the vessel that he was shaping from the clay became flawed in his hand; so he formed it into another vessel, as it seemed best for him to do.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">6</span>“O house of Israel, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, can I not treat <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> as this potter treats his clay? Just like clay in the potter’s hand, so are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> hand, O house of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>At any time I might announce that a nation or kingdom will be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed.
<span class="reftext">8</span>But if that nation I warned turns from its evil, then I will relent of the disaster I had planned to bring.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And if at another time I announce that I will build up and establish a nation or kingdom,
<span class="reftext">10</span>and if it does evil in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> sight and does not listen to <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> voice, then I will relent of the good I had intended for it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now therefore, tell the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘Behold, I am planning a disaster for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and devising a plan against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways, and correct <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> ways and deeds.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But they will reply, ‘It is hopeless. We will follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: </p><p class="indent1stline"> “Inquire among the nations: </p><p class="indent"> Who has ever heard things like these? </p><p class="indent"> Virgin Israel has done a most terrible thing.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Does the snow of Lebanon </p><p class="indent"> ever leave its rocky slopes? </p><p class="indent1"> Or do its cool waters flowing from a distance </p><p class="indent"> ever run dry?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Yet <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people have forgotten <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>. </p><p class="indent"> They burn incense to worthless idols </p><p class="indent"> that make them stumble in their ways, </p><p class="indent1"> leaving the ancient roads </p><p class="indent"> to walk on rutted bypaths </p><p class="indent"> instead of on the highway.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>They have made their land a desolation, </p><p class="indent"> a perpetual object of scorn; </p><p class="indent1"> all who pass by will be appalled </p><p class="indent"> and shake their heads.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>I will scatter them before the enemy </p><p class="indent"> like the east wind. </p><p class="indent1"> I will show them <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> back and not <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> face </p><p class="indent"> in the day of their calamity.”
</p><p class="hdg">Another Plot against Jeremiah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jeremiah 11:18–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then some said, “Come, let us make plans against Jeremiah, for the law will never be lost to the priest, nor counsel to the wise, nor an oracle to the prophet.
