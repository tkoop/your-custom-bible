<font >In the eighth month of the second year of
Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of
Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >The LORD was very angry with your
fathers. So tell the people that this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
‘Return to Me, declares the LORD of Hosts, and I will return to
you, says the LORD of Hosts.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not be like your fathers, to whom the
former prophets proclaimed that this is what the LORD of Hosts says:
‘Turn now from your evil ways and deeds.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But they did not listen or pay attention
to Me, declares the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Where are your fathers now? And the
prophets, do they live forever? But did not My words and My statutes,
which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers?
They repented and said, ‘Just as the LORD of Hosts purposed to do
to us according to our ways and deeds, so He has done to us.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh
month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of
the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, the son of
Iddo. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I looked out into the night and saw a man
riding on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in the
hollow, and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What are these, my lord?” I asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the angel who was speaking with me
replied, “I will show you what they are.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the man standing among the myrtle
trees explained, “They are the ones the LORD has sent to patrol the
earth.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the riders answered the angel of the
LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have patrolled
the earth, and behold, all the earth is at rest and tranquil.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the angel of the LORD said, “How
long, O LORD of Hosts, will You withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the
cities of Judah, with which You have been angry these seventy years?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the LORD spoke kind and comforting
words to the angel who was speaking with me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the angel who was speaking with me
said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘I
am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion, but I am fiercely angry with
the nations that are at ease. For I was a little angry, but they have
added to the calamity.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I
will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there My house will be
rebuilt, declares the LORD of Hosts, and a measuring line will be
stretched out over Jerusalem.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Proclaim further that this is what the
LORD of Hosts says: ‘My cities will again overflow with prosperity;
the LORD will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I looked up and saw four horns. So I
asked the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And he told me, “These are the horns
that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What are these coming to do?” I
asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And He replied, “These are the horns
that scattered Judah so that no one could raise his head; but the
craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the
nations that have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to
scatter it.” </font>
