</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> was very angry with your fathers.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So tell the people that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: ‘Return to Me, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, and I will return to you, says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: ‘Turn now from your evil ways and deeds.’ </p><p class="reg1"> But they did not listen or pay attention to Me, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Where are your fathers now? And the prophets, do they live forever?
<span class="reftext">6</span>But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? They repented and said, ‘Just as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts purposed to do to us according to our ways and deeds, so He has done to us.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Vision of the Horses</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat,<span class="fn">a</span>  in the second year of Darius, the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>I looked out into the night and saw a man riding on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in the hollow, and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“What are these, my lord?” I asked. </p><p class="reg1"> And the angel who was speaking with me replied, “I will show you what they are.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has sent to patrol the earth.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And the riders answered the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is at rest and tranquil.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, “How long, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span> of Hosts, will You withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been angry these seventy years?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who was speaking with me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the angel who was speaking with me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,
<span class="reftext">15</span>but I am fiercely angry with the nations that are at ease. For I was a little angry, but they have added to the calamity.<span class="fn">b</span>’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there My house will be rebuilt, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Proclaim further that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: ‘My cities will again overflow with prosperity; <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Vision of the Horns and the Craftsmen</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then I looked up and saw four horns.
<span class="reftext">19</span>So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these?” </p><p class="reg1"> And he told me, “These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> showed me four craftsmen.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>“What are these coming to do?” I asked. </p><p class="reg1"> And He replied, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise his head; but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations that have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Shebat</i> is the eleventh month of the Hebrew lunar calendar, usually occurring within the months of January and February.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">they have overdone the punishment</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
