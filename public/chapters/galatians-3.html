<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Faith and Belief<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(James 2:14–26)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.
<span class="reftext">2</span>I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Are you so foolish? After starting in the Spirit, are you now finishing in the flesh?
<span class="reftext">4</span>Have you suffered so much for nothing, if it really was for nothing?
<span class="reftext">5</span>Does God lavish His Spirit on you and work miracles among you because you practice the law, or because you hear and believe?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So also, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Understand, then, that those who have faith are sons of Abraham.
<span class="reftext">8</span>The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and foretold the gospel to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">9</span>So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
</p><p class="hdg">Christ Has Redeemed Us</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>All who rely on works of the law are under a curse. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because, “The righteous will live by faith.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">12</span>The law, however, is not based on faith; on the contrary, “The man who does these things will live by them.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.”<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">14</span>He redeemed us in order that the blessing promised to Abraham<span class="fn">g</span>  would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.
</p><p class="hdg">The Purpose of the Law<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Romans 7:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Brothers, let me put this in human terms. Even a human covenant, once it is ratified, cannot be cancelled or amended.
<span class="reftext">16</span>The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say, “and to seeds,” meaning many, but “and to your seed,”<span class="fn">h</span>  meaning One, who is Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>What I mean is this: The law that came 430 years later does not revoke the covenant previously established by God, so as to nullify the promise.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God freely granted it to Abraham through a promise.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the arrival of the seed to whom the promise referred. It was administered through angels by a mediator.
<span class="reftext">20</span>A mediator is unnecessary, however, for only one party; but God is one.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Is the law, then, opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come from the law.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But the Scripture pronounces all things confined by sin, so that by faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Before this faith came, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until faith should be revealed.
<span class="reftext">24</span>So the law became our guardian to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
</p><p class="hdg">Sons through Faith in Christ</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
<span class="reftext">27</span>For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
<span class="reftext">28</span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
<span class="reftext">29</span>And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the promise.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Genesis 15:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> See Genesis 12:3, Genesis 18:18, and Genesis 22:18.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Deuteronomy 27:26 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Habakkuk 2:4<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Leviticus 18:5; see also Ezekiel 20:11, 13, and 21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Deuteronomy 21:23 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the blessing of Abraham</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Genesis 12:7; Genesis 13:15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
