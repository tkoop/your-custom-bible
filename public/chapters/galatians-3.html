<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched
you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as
crucified. I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you
receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Are you so foolish? After starting in the
Spirit, are you now finishing in the flesh? Have you suffered so much
for nothing, if it really was for nothing? Does God lavish His Spirit
on you and work miracles among you because you practice the law, or
because you hear and believe? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So also, “Abraham believed God, and it
was credited to him as righteousness.” Understand, then, that those
who have faith are sons of Abraham. The Scripture foresaw that God
would justify the Gentiles by faith, and foretold the gospel to
Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.” So those who
have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All who rely on works of the law are under
a curse. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not
continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.” Now it
is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because,
“The righteous will live by faith.” The law, however, is not
based on faith; on the contrary, “The man who does these things
will live by them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Christ redeemed us from the curse of the
law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written: “Cursed is
everyone who is hung on a tree.” He redeemed us in order that the
blessing promised to Abraham would come to the Gentiles in Christ
Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Brothers, let me put this in human terms.
Even a human covenant, once it is ratified, cannot be canceled or
amended. The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The
Scripture does not say, “and to seeds,” meaning many, but “and
to your seed,” meaning One, who is Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >What I mean is this: The law that came 430
years later does not revoke the covenant previously established by
God, so as to nullify the promise. For if the inheritance depends on
the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God freely
granted it to Abraham through a promise. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Why then was the law given? It was added
because of transgressions, until the arrival of the seed to whom the
promise referred. It was administered through angels by a mediator. A
mediator is unnecessary, however, for only one party; but God is one.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Is the law, then, opposed to the promises
of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could impart
life, then righteousness would certainly have come from the law. But
the Scripture pronounces all things confined by sin, so that by faith
in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Before this faith came, we were held in
custody under the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. So
the law became our guardian to lead us to Christ, that we might be
justified by faith. Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a
guardian. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are all sons of God through faith in
Christ Jesus. For all of you who were baptized into Christ have
clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave
nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And
if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed and heirs
according to the promise. </font>
