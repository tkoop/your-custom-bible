<span class="reftext">2</span>He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier ways<span class="fn">a</span>  of his father David. He did not seek out the Baals,
<span class="reftext">4</span>but he sought the God of his father and walked by His commandments rather than the practices of Israel.
<span class="reftext">5</span>So the LORD established the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought him tribute, so that he had an abundance of riches and honour.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And his heart took delight<span class="fn">b</span>  in the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah,
<span class="reftext">8</span>accompanied by certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah—along with the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
<span class="reftext">9</span>They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD. They went throughout the towns of Judah and taught the people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the dread of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Some Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats from their flocks.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah
<span class="reftext">13</span>and kept vast supplies in the cities of Judah. He also had warriors in Jerusalem who were mighty men of valour.
<span class="reftext">14</span>These are their numbers according to the houses of their fathers: </p><p class="list1stline"> From Judah, the commanders of thousands: </p><p class="list"> Adnah the commander, and with him 300,000 mighty men of valour;
</p><p class="list"><span class="reftext">15</span>next to him, Jehohanan the commander, and with him 280,000;
</p><p class="list"><span class="reftext">16</span>and next to him, Amasiah son of Zichri, the volunteer for the LORD, and with him 200,000 mighty men of valour.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>From Benjamin: </p><p class="list"> Eliada, a mighty man of valour, and with him 200,000 armed with bows and shields;
</p><p class="list"><span class="reftext">18</span>and next to him, Jehozabad, and with him 180,000 armed for battle.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in his early years he walked in the ways</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">was exalted</i> or <i class="calibre6">was courageous</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
