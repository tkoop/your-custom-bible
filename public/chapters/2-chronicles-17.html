<span class="reftext">2</span>He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Now <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier ways<span class="fn">a</span>  of his father David. He did not seek out the Baals,
<span class="reftext">4</span>but he sought the God of his father and walked by <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> commandments rather than the practices of Israel.
<span class="reftext">5</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> established the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought him tribute, so that he had an abundance of riches and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span>.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And his heart took delight<span class="fn">b</span>  in the ways of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>; furthermore, he removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah,
<span class="reftext">8</span>accompanied by certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah—along with the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
<span class="reftext">9</span>They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. They went throughout the towns of Judah and taught the people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the dread of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Some Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats from their flocks.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah
<span class="reftext">13</span>and kept vast supplies in the cities of Judah. He also had warriors in Jerusalem who were mighty men of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span>.
