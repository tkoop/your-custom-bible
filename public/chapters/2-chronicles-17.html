<font ><b>Jehoshaphat Reigns in Judah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Asa’s son Jehoshaphat reigned in his
place, and he strengthened himself against Israel. He stationed
troops in every fortified city of Judah and put garrisons in the land
of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had
captured. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because
he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek
out the Baals, but he sought the God of his father and walked by His
commandments rather than the practices of Israel. So the LORD
established the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought him
tribute, so that he had an abundance of riches and honor. And his
heart took delight in the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed
the high places and Asherah poles from Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the third year of his reign,
Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah,
Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah, accompanied by
certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth,
Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah—along with the
priests Elishama and Jehoram. They taught throughout Judah, taking
with them the Book of the Law of the LORD. They went throughout the
towns of Judah and taught the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the dread of the LORD fell upon all
the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah, so that they did not
make war against Jehoshaphat. Some Philistines also brought gifts and
silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him 7,700
rams and 7,700 goats from their flocks. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger,
and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah and kept vast
supplies in the cities of Judah. He also had warriors in Jerusalem
who were mighty men of valor. These are their numbers according to
the houses of their fathers: </font>

with him 280,000; </font>

<font >and next to him, Amasiah son of Zichri,
the volunteer for the LORD, and with him 200,000 mighty men of valor.

besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah. </font>
