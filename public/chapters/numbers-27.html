<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Daughters of Zelophehad<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 36:1–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now the daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. These were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They approached
<span class="reftext">2</span>the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and the whole congregation, and said,
<span class="reftext">3</span>“Our father died in the wilderness, but he was not among the followers of Korah who gathered together against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. Instead, he died because of his own sin, and he had no sons.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Why should the name of our father disappear from his clan because he had no sons? Give us property among our father’s brothers.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So Moses brought their case before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,
<span class="reftext">6</span>and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> answered him,
<span class="reftext">7</span>“The daughters of Zelophehad speak correctly. You certainly must give them property as an inheritance among their father’s brothers, and transfer their father’s inheritance to them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Furthermore, you shall say to the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and leaves no son, you are to transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
<span class="reftext">9</span>If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers.
<span class="reftext">10</span>If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And if his father has no brothers, give his inheritance to the next of kin from his clan, that he may take possession of it. This is to be a statutory ordinance for the Israelites, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has commanded Moses.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">Moses Requests a Successor<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 3:23–29)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses, “Go up this mountain of the Abarim range<span class="fn">a</span>  and see the land that I have given the Israelites.
<span class="reftext">13</span>After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was;
<span class="reftext">14</span>for when the congregation contended in the Wilderness of Zin, both of you rebelled against My command to show My holiness in their sight regarding the waters.” Those were the waters of Meribah<span class="fn">b</span>  in Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Zin.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So Moses appealed to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,
<span class="reftext">16</span>“May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation
<span class="reftext">17</span>who will go out and come in before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will not be like sheep without a shepherd.”
</p><p class="hdg">Joshua to Succeed Moses<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 31:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> replied to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man with the Spirit in him, and lay your hands on him.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation, and commission him in their sight.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Confer on him some of your authority, so that the whole congregation of Israel will obey him.
<span class="reftext">21</span>He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who will seek counsel for him before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> by the <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> of the Urim.<span class="fn">c</span>  At his command, he and all the Israelites with him—the entire congregation—will go out and come in.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Moses did as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded him. He took Joshua, had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation,
<span class="reftext">23</span>and laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had instructed through Moses.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">Go up Mount Nebo beyond the Jordan</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Meribah</i> means <i class="calibre6">quarreling</i>; see Exodus 17:7.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the Lights</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
