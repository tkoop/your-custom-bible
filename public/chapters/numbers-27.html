<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Daughters of Zelophehad</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the daughters of Zelophehad son of
Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh,
belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. These were the names
of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They
approached the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, stood before Moses,
Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and the whole congregation, and
said, “Our father died in the wilderness, but he was not among the
followers of Korah who gathered together against the LORD. Instead,
he died because of his own sin, and he had no sons. Why should the
name of our father disappear from his clan because he had no sons?
Give us property among our father’s brothers.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Moses brought their case before the
LORD, and the LORD answered him, “The daughters of Zelophehad speak
correctly. You certainly must give them property as an inheritance
among their father’s brothers, and transfer their father’s
inheritance to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Furthermore, you shall say to the
Israelites, ‘If a man dies and leaves no son, you are to transfer
his inheritance to his daughter. If he has no daughter, give his
inheritance to his brothers. If he has no brothers, give his
inheritance to his father’s brothers. And if his father has no
brothers, give his inheritance to the next of kin from his clan, that
he may take possession of it. This is to be a statutory ordinance for
the Israelites, as the LORD has commanded Moses.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go up this
mountain of the Abarim range and see the land that I have given the
Israelites. After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your
people, as your brother Aaron was; for when the congregation
contended in the Wilderness of Zin, both of you rebelled against My
command to show My holiness in their sight regarding the waters.”
Those were the waters of Meribah in Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Zin.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Moses appealed to the LORD, “May the
LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the
congregation who will go out and come in before them, and who will
lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD
will not be like sheep without a shepherd.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD replied to Moses, “Take
Joshua son of Nun, a man with the Spirit in him, and lay your hands
on him. Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole
congregation, and commission him in their sight. Confer on him some
of your authority, so that the whole congregation of Israel will obey
him. He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who will seek counsel
for him before the LORD by the judgment of the Urim. At his command,
he and all the Israelites with him—the entire congregation—will
go out and come in.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moses did as the LORD had commanded him.
He took Joshua, had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole
congregation, and laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the
LORD had instructed through Moses. </font>
