To the tune of “Lilies.” Of David. </p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>Save me, O God, </p><p class="indent"> for the waters are up to my neck.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>I have sunk into the miry depths, </p><p class="indent"> where there is no footing; </p><p class="indent1"> I have drifted into deep waters, </p><p class="indent"> where the flood engulfs me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>I am weary from my crying; </p><p class="indent"> my throat is parched. </p><p class="indent1"> My eyes fail, </p><p class="indent"> looking for my God.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Those who hate me without cause </p><p class="indent"> outnumber the hairs of my head; </p><p class="indent1"> many are those who would destroy me—</p><p class="indent"> my enemies for no reason.<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> Though I did not steal, </p><p class="indent"> I must repay.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>You know my folly, O God, </p><p class="indent"> and my guilt is not hidden from You.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>May those who hope in You not be ashamed through me, </p><p class="indent"> O Lord GOD of Hosts; </p><p class="indent1"> may those who seek You not be dishonored through me, </p><p class="indent"> O God of Israel.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>For I have endured scorn for Your sake, </p><p class="indent"> and shame has covered my face.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>I have become a stranger to my brothers </p><p class="indent"> and a foreigner to my mother’s sons,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>because zeal for Your house has consumed me,<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and the insults of those who insult You have fallen on me.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>I wept and fasted, </p><p class="indent"> but it brought me reproach.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>I made sackcloth my clothing, </p><p class="indent"> and I was sport to them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Those who sit at the gate mock me, </p><p class="indent"> and I am the song of drunkards.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>But my prayer to You, O LORD, </p><p class="indent"> is for a time of favor. </p><p class="indent1"> In Your abundant loving devotion, O God, </p><p class="indent"> answer me with Your sure salvation.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Rescue me from the mire </p><p class="indent"> and do not let me sink; </p><p class="indent1"> deliver me from my foes </p><p class="indent"> and out of the deep waters.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Do not let the floods engulf me </p><p class="indent"> or the depths swallow me up; </p><p class="indent"> let not the Pit close its mouth over me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Answer me, O LORD, </p><p class="indent"> for Your loving devotion is good; </p><p class="indent"> turn to me in keeping with Your great compassion.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Hide not Your face from Your servant, </p><p class="indent"> for I am in distress. </p><p class="indent"> Answer me quickly!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Draw near to my soul and redeem me; </p><p class="indent"> ransom me because of my foes.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>You know my reproach, my shame and disgrace. </p><p class="indent"> All my adversaries are before You.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Insults have broken my heart, </p><p class="indent"> and I am in despair. </p><p class="indent1"> I looked for sympathy, but there was none, </p><p class="indent"> for comforters, but I found no one.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>They poisoned my food with gall </p><p class="indent"> and gave me vinegar to quench my thirst.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>May their table become a snare; </p><p class="indent"> may it be a retribution and a trap.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, </p><p class="indent"> and their backs be bent forever.<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Pour out Your wrath upon them, </p><p class="indent"> and let Your burning anger overtake them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>May their place be deserted; </p><p class="indent"> let there be no one to dwell in their tents.<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>For they persecute the one You struck </p><p class="indent"> and recount the pain of those You wounded.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Add iniquity to their iniquity; </p><p class="indent"> let them not share in Your righteousness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>May they be blotted out of the Book of Life </p><p class="indent"> and not listed with the righteous.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">29</span>But I am in pain and distress; </p><p class="indent"> let Your salvation protect me, O God.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>I will praise God’s name in song </p><p class="indent"> and exalt Him with thanksgiving.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>And this will please the LORD more than an ox, </p><p class="indent"> more than a bull with horns and hooves.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>The humble will see and rejoice. </p><p class="indent"> You who seek God, let your hearts be revived!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>For the LORD listens to the needy </p><p class="indent"> and does not despise His captive people.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">34</span>Let heaven and earth praise Him, </p><p class="indent"> the seas and everything that moves in them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>For God will save Zion </p><p class="indent"> and rebuild the cities of Judah, </p><p class="indent"> that they may dwell there and possess it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">36</span>The descendants of His servants will inherit it, </p><p class="indent"> and those who love His name will settle in it.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> See John 15:25<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Cited in John 2:17<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Cited in Romans 15:3<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> A slight revocalization of the Hebrew (see also LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate); literally <i class="calibre6">may their prosperity be a trap</i>; cited in Romans 11:9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">and may their loins tremble continually</i>; cited in Romans 11:10<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Cited in Acts 1:20<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
