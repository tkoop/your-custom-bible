<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Peter’s Report at Jerusalem</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>The apostles and brothers throughout Judea soon heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers<span class="fn">a</span>  took issue with him
<span class="reftext">3</span>and said, “You visited uncircumcised men and ate with them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But Peter began and explained to them the whole sequence of events:
<span class="reftext">5</span>“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision of something like a large sheet being let down from <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> by its four corners, and it came right down to me.
<span class="reftext">6</span>I looked at it closely and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then I heard a voice saying to me, <span>‘Get up, Peter, kill and eat.’</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>‘No, Lord,’ I said, ‘for nothing impure<span class="fn">b</span>  or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>But the voice spoke from <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> a second time, <span>‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Just then three men sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.
<span class="reftext">12</span>The <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> told me to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s home.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.
<span class="reftext">14</span>He will convey to you a message by which you and all your household will be saved.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>As I began to speak, the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> fell upon them, just as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had fallen upon us at the beginning.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Then I remembered the word of the Lord, as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> used to say, <span>‘John baptized with water, but <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be baptized with the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>.’<span class="fn">c</span> </span>
<span class="reftext">17</span>So if God gave them the same gift <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder the work of God?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>When they heard this, their objections were put to rest, and they glorified God, saying, “So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Church at Antioch</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Meanwhile those scattered by the persecution that began with Stephen <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message only to Jews.
<span class="reftext">20</span>But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks<span class="fn">d</span>  as well, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus.
<span class="reftext">21</span>The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>When news of this reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
<span class="reftext">23</span>When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to abide in the Lord with all their hearts.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Barnabas was a good man, full of the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
<span class="reftext">26</span>and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. So for a full year they met together with the church and taught large numbers of people. The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>In those days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
<span class="reftext">28</span>One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted through the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> that a great famine would sweep across the whole world.<span class="fn">e</span>  (This happened under Claudius.)
<span class="reftext">29</span>So the disciples, each according to his ability, decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.
<span class="reftext">30</span>This they did, sending their gifts to the elders with Barnabas and Saul.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">those of the circumcision</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">common</i>; similarly in verse 9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">‘John baptized in water, but in a few days you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.’</i> Acts 1:5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Hellenists</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the entire Roman world</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
