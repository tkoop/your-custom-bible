<font ><b>The Church at Jerusalem and Antioch</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The apostles and brothers throughout Judea
soon heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. So
when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers took issue
with him and said, “You visited uncircumcised men and ate with
them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But Peter began and explained to them the
whole sequence of events: “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and
in a trance I saw a vision of something like a large sheet being let
down from heaven by its four corners, and it came right down to me. I
looked at it closely and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild
beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air. Then I heard a voice saying
to me, <font color="#a80000">‘Get up, Peter, kill and eat.’</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
‘<font >No, Lord,’ I said, ‘for nothing
impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But the voice spoke from heaven a second
time, <font color="#a80000">‘Do not call anything impure that God
has made clean.’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >This happened three times, and everything
was drawn back up into heaven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Just then three men sent to me from
Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. The Spirit told me
to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers also went
with me, and we entered the man’s home. He told us how he had seen
an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon
who is called Peter. He will convey to you a message by which you and
all your household will be saved.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell
upon them, just as He had fallen upon us at the beginning. Then I
remembered the word of the Lord, as He used to say, <font color="#a80000">‘John
baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’
</font>So if God gave them the same gift He gave us who believed in
the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder the work of God?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When they heard this, their objections
were put to rest, and they glorified God, saying, “So then, God has
granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Meanwhile those scattered by the
persecution that began with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia,
Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message only to Jews. But some of
them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began speaking
to the Greeks as well, proclaiming the good news about the Lord
Jesus. The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number of
people believed and turned to the Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When news of this reached the ears of the
church in Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas to Antioch. When he arrived
and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to
abide in the Lord with all their hearts. Barnabas was a good man,
full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were
brought to the Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for
Saul, and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. So for a
full year they met together with the church and taught large numbers
of people. The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >In those days some prophets came down from
Jerusalem to Antioch. One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted
through the Spirit that a great famine would sweep across the whole
world. (This happened under Claudius.) So the disciples, each
according to his ability, decided to send relief to the brothers
living in Judea. This they did, sending their gifts to the elders
with Barnabas and Saul. </font>
