<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The People Bring More than Enough</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>“So Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person are to carry out everything commanded by the LORD, who has given them skill and ability to know how to perform all the work of constructing the sanctuary.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Then Moses summoned Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person whom the LORD had gifted—everyone whose heart stirred him to come and do the work.
<span class="reftext">3</span>They received from Moses all the contributions that the Israelites had brought to carry out the service of constructing the sanctuary. </p><p class="reg1"> Meanwhile, the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning,
<span class="reftext">4</span>so that all the skilled craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left their work
<span class="reftext">5</span>and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the LORD has commanded us to do.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>After Moses had given an order, they sent a proclamation throughout the camp: “No man or woman should make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing more,
<span class="reftext">7</span>since what they already had was more than enough to perform all the work.
</p><p class="hdg">The Ten Curtains for the Tabernacle<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 26:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>All the skilled craftsmen among the workmen made the ten curtains for the tabernacle. They were made of finely spun linen, as well as blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, with cherubim skilfully worked into them.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Each curtain was twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide;<span class="fn">a</span>  all the curtains were the same size.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And he joined five of the curtains together, and the other five he joined as well.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>He made loops of blue material on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and also on the end curtain in the second set.
<span class="reftext">12</span>He made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops lined up opposite one another.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He also made fifty gold clasps to join the curtains together, so that the tabernacle was a unit.
</p><p class="hdg">The Eleven Curtains of Goat Hair<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 26:7–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>He then made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven curtains in all.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Each of the eleven curtains was the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">16</span>He joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another.
<span class="reftext">17</span>He made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set.
<span class="reftext">18</span>He also made fifty bronze clasps to join the tent together as a unit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Additionally, he made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of fine leather.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Frames and Bases<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 26:15–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Next, he constructed upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Two tenons<span class="fn">e</span>  were connected to each other for each frame. He made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>He constructed twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle,
<span class="reftext">24</span>with forty silver bases to put under the twenty frames—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>For the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty frames
<span class="reftext">26</span>and forty silver bases—two bases under each frame.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>He made six frames for the rear of the tabernacle, the west side,
<span class="reftext">28</span>and two frames for the two back corners of the tabernacle,
<span class="reftext">29</span>coupled together from bottom to top and fitted into a single ring. He made both corners in this way.
<span class="reftext">30</span>So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>He also made five crossbars of acacia wood for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
<span class="reftext">32</span>five for those on the other side, and five for those on the rear side of the tabernacle, to the west.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>He made the central crossbar to run through the centre of the frames, from one end to the other.
<span class="reftext">34</span>And he overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. He also overlaid the crossbars with gold.
</p><p class="hdg">The Veil<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 26:31–35)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Next, he made the veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen, with cherubim skilfully worked into it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>He also made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold, along with gold hooks; and he cast four silver bases for the posts.
</p><p class="hdg">The Curtain for the Entrance<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 26:36–37)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>For the entrance to the tent, he made a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen,
<span class="reftext">38</span>together with five posts and their hooks. </p><p class="reg1"> He overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold, and their five bases were bronze.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Each of the ten curtains was approximately 42 feet long and 6 feet wide (12.8 meters long and 1.8 meters wide).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Each of the eleven curtains was approximately 45 feet long and 6 feet wide (13.7 meters long and 1.8 meters wide).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Possibly the hides of large aquatic mammals<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Each frame was approximately 15 feet long and 2.25 feet wide (4.6 meters long and 68.6 centimeters wide).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, projecting pieces of wood made for insertion into another piece; similarly in verse 24.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
