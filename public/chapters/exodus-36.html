<font ><b>The People Bring More than Enough</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >So Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled
person are to carry out everything commanded by the LORD, who has
given them skill and ability to know how to perform all the work of
constructing the sanctuary.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses summoned Bezalel, Oholiab, and
every skilled person whom the LORD had gifted—everyone whose heart
stirred him to come and do the work. They received from Moses all the
contributions that the Israelites had brought to carry out the
service of constructing the sanctuary. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, the people continued to bring
freewill offerings morning after morning, so that all the skilled
craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left their
work and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough
for doing the work the LORD has commanded us to do.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Moses had given an order, they sent
a proclamation throughout the camp: “No man or woman should make
anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were
restrained from bringing more, since what they already had was more
than enough to perform all the work. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All the skilled craftsmen among the
workmen made the ten curtains for the tabernacle. They were made of
finely spun linen, as well as blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, with
cherubim skillfully worked into them. Each curtain was twenty-eight
cubits long and four cubits wide; all the curtains were the same
size. And he joined five of the curtains together, and the other five
he joined as well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He made loops of blue material on the edge
of the end curtain in the first set, and also on the end curtain in
the second set. He made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on
the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops lined up
opposite one another. He also made fifty gold clasps to join the
curtains together, so that the tabernacle was a unit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He then made curtains of goat hair for the
tent over the tabernacle—eleven curtains in all. Each of the eleven
curtains was the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.
He joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into
another. He made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the
first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding
curtain in the second set. He also made fifty bronze clasps to join
the tent together as a unit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Additionally, he made for the tent a
covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of fine
leather. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next, he constructed upright frames of
acacia wood for the tabernacle. Each frame was ten cubits long and a
cubit and a half wide. Two tenons were connected to each other for
each frame. He made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He constructed twenty frames for the south
side of the tabernacle, with forty silver bases to put under the
twenty frames—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the second side of the tabernacle, the
north side, he made twenty frames and forty silver bases—two bases
under each frame. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He made six frames for the rear of the
tabernacle, the west side, and two frames for the two back corners of
the tabernacle, coupled together from bottom to top and fitted into a
single ring. He made both corners in this way. So there were eight
frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He also made five crossbars of acacia wood
for the frames on one side of the tabernacle, five for those on the
other side, and five for those on the rear side of the tabernacle, to
the west. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He made the central crossbar to run
through the center of the frames, from one end to the other. And he
overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the
crossbars. He also overlaid the crossbars with gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next, he made the veil of blue, purple,
and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen, with cherubim skillfully
worked into it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He also made four posts of acacia wood for
it and overlaid them with gold, along with gold hooks; and he cast
four silver bases for the posts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the entrance to the tent, he made a
curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely
spun linen, together with five posts and their hooks. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He overlaid the tops of the posts and
their bands with gold, and their five bases were bronze. </font>
