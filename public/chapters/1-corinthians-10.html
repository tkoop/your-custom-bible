<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Warnings from Israel’s Past</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I do not want you to be unaware, brothers,
that our forefathers were all under the cloud, and that they all
passed through the sea. They were all baptized into Moses in the
cloud and in the sea. They all ate the same spiritual food and drank
the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that
accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. Nevertheless, God was not
pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the
wilderness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">These things took place as examples to
keep us from craving evil things as they did. Do not be idolaters, as
some of them were. As it is written: “The people sat down to eat
and to drink, and got up to indulge in revelry.” We should not
commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day
twenty-three thousand of them died. We should not test Christ, as
some of them did, and were killed by snakes. And do not complain, as
some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now these things happened to them as
examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the
fulfillment of the ages has come. So the one who thinks he is
standing firm should be careful not to fall. No temptation has seized
you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; He will not
let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are
tempted, He will also provide an escape, so that you can stand up
under it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
I speak to reasonable people; judge for yourselves what I say. Is not
the cup of blessing that we bless a participation in the blood of
Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the
body of Christ? Because there is one loaf, we who are many are one
body; for we all partake of the one loaf. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Consider the people of Israel: Are not
those who eat the sacrifices fellow partakers in the altar? Am I
suggesting, then, that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or
that an idol is anything? No, but the sacrifices of pagans are
offered to demons, not to God. And I do not want you to be
participants with demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and
the cup of demons too; you cannot partake in the table of the Lord
and the table of demons too. Are we trying to provoke the Lord to
jealousy? Are we stronger than He? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Everything is permissible,” but not
everything is beneficial. “Everything is permissible,” but not
everything is edifying. No one should seek his own good, but the good
of others. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Eat anything sold in the meat market
without raising questions of conscience, for, “The earth is the
Lord’s, and the fullness thereof.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and
you want to go, eat anything set before you without raising questions
of conscience. But if someone tells you, “This food was offered to
idols,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who told you
and for the sake of conscience— the other one’s conscience, I
mean, not your own. For why should my freedom be determined by
someone else’s conscience? If I partake in the meal with
thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give
thanks? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So whether you eat or drink or whatever
you do, do it all to the glory of God. Do not become a stumbling
block, whether to Jews or Greeks or the church of God— as I also
try to please everyone in all I do. For I am not seeking my own good,
but the good of many, that they may be saved. </font>
