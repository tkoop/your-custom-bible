<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Warnings from Israel’s Past<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 16:41–50; Numbers 25:1–5)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud, and that they all passed through the sea.
<span class="reftext">2</span>They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
<span class="reftext">3</span>They all ate the same spiritual food
<span class="reftext">4</span>and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>These things took place as examples to keep us from craving evil things as they did.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written: “The people sat down to eat and to drink, and got up to indulge in revelry.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">8</span>We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died.
<span class="reftext">9</span>We should not test Christ,<span class="fn">b</span>  as some of them did, and were killed by snakes.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And do not complain, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now these things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the <span class='spell ca'>fulfillment</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfilment</span><span class='spell us'>fulfillment</span> of the ages has come.
<span class="reftext">12</span>So the one who thinks he is standing firm should be careful not to fall.
<span class="reftext">13</span>No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will also provide an escape, so that you can stand up under it.
</p><p class="hdg">Flee from Idolatry<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 20:22–26)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
<span class="reftext">15</span>I speak to reasonable people; judge for yourselves what I say.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?
<span class="reftext">17</span>Because there is one loaf, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Consider the people of Israel: Are not those who eat the sacrifices fellow partakers in the altar?
<span class="reftext">19</span>Am I suggesting, then, that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?
<span class="reftext">20</span>No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God. And I do not want you to be participants with demons.
<span class="reftext">21</span>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot partake in the table of the Lord and the table of demons too.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span>?
</p><p class="hdg">All to God’s Glory<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Peter 4:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>“Everything is permissible,”<span class="fn">d</span>  but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is permissible,” but not everything is edifying.
<span class="reftext">24</span>No one should seek his own good, but the good of others.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,
<span class="reftext">26</span>for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat anything set before you without raising questions of conscience.
<span class="reftext">28</span>But if someone tells you, “This food was offered to idols,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience—<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">29</span>the other one’s conscience, I mean, not your own. For why should my freedom be determined by someone else’s conscience?
<span class="reftext">30</span>If I partake in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all to the glory of God.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Do not become a stumbling block, whether to Jews or Greeks or the church of God—
<span class="reftext">33</span>as I also try to please everyone in all I do. For I am not seeking my own good, but the good of many, that they may be saved.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">to play</i>; Exodus 32:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> WH, NE, and Tischendorf <i class="calibre6">test the Lord</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the destroyer</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">“All things are lawful,”</i> twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Psalm 24:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">and for the sake of conscience—for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof—</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
