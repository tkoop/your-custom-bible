<font ><b>A Light for the Gentiles</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now in the church at Antioch there were
prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of
Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch), and
Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy
Spirit said, “Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to
which I have called them.” And after they had fasted and prayed,
they laid their hands on them and sent them off. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Barnabas and Saul, sent forth by the
Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus.
When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the
Jewish synagogues. And John was with them as their helper. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They traveled through the whole island as
far as Paphos, where they found a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet
named Bar-Jesus, an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The
proconsul, a man of intelligence, summoned Barnabas and Saul because
he wanted to hear the word of God. But Elymas the sorcerer (for that
is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul
from the faith. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Saul, who was also called Paul,
filled with the Holy Spirit, looked directly at Elymas and said, “O
child of the devil and enemy of all righteousness, you are full of
all kinds of deceit and trickery! Will you never stop perverting the
straight ways of the Lord? Now look, the hand of the Lord is against
you, and for a time you will be blind and unable to see the light of
the sun.” Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he
groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the proconsul saw what had happened,
he believed, for he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After setting sail from Paphos, Paul and
his companions came to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to
return to Jerusalem. And from Perga, they traveled inland to Pisidian
Antioch, where they entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and sat
down. After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue
leaders sent word to them: “Brothers, if you have a word of
encouragement for the people, please speak.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and
began to speak: “Men of Israel and you Gentiles who fear God,
listen to me! The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers. He
made them into a great people during their stay in Egypt, and with an
uplifted arm He led them out of that land. He endured their conduct
for about forty years in the wilderness. And having vanquished seven
nations in Canaan, He gave their land to His people as an
inheritance. All this took about 450 years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After this, God gave them judges until the
time of Samuel the prophet. Then the people asked for a king, and God
gave them forty years under Saul son of Kish, from the tribe of
Benjamin. After removing Saul, He raised up David as their king and
testified about him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse a man after
My own heart; he will carry out My will in its entirety.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From the descendants of this man, God has
brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as He promised. Before the
arrival of Jesus, John preached a baptism of repentance to all the
people of Israel. As John was completing his course, he said, ‘Who
do you suppose I am? I am not that One. But He is coming after me
whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Brothers, children of Abraham, and you
Gentiles who fear God, it is to us that this message of salvation has
been sent. The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize
Jesus, yet in condemning Him they fulfilled the words of the prophets
that are read every Sabbath. And though they found no ground for a
death sentence, they asked Pilate to have Him executed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they had carried out all that was
written about Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a
tomb. But God raised Him from the dead, and for many days He was seen
by those who had accompanied Him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are
now His witnesses to our people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now we proclaim to you the good news:
What God promised our fathers He has fulfilled for us, their
children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >You are My Son; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >today I have become Your Father.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In fact, God raised Him from the dead,
never to see decay. As He has said: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >I will give you the holy and sure
blessings promised to David.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So also, He says in another Psalm: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >You will not let Your Holy One see
decay.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For when David had served God’s purpose
in his own generation, he fell asleep. His body was buried with his
fathers and saw decay. But the One whom God raised from the dead did
not see decay. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore let it be known to you,
brothers, that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to
you. Through Him everyone who believes is justified from everything
you could not be justified from by the law of Moses. Watch out, then,
that what was spoken by the prophets does not happen to you: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Look, you scoffers, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >wonder and perish! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >For I am doing a work in your days </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >that you would never believe, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >even if someone told you.’” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the
synagogue, the people urged them to continue this message on the next
Sabbath. After the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and
devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to
them and urged them to continue in the grace of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the following Sabbath, nearly the whole
city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. But when the Jews saw the
crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and they blasphemously
contradicted what Paul was saying. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Paul and Barnabas answered them
boldly: “It was necessary to speak the word of God to you first.
But since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of
eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles. For this is what the Lord
has commanded us: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >I have made you a light for the
Gentiles, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >to bring salvation to the ends of the
earth.’” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Gentiles heard this, they
rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord, and all who were
appointed for eternal life believed. And the word of the Lord spread
throughout that region. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Jews, however, incited the religious
women of prominence and the leading men of the city. They stirred up
persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their
district. So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against
them and went to Iconium. And the disciples were filled with joy and
with the Holy Spirit. </font>
