<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a><span class="reftext">2</span>While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a><span class="reftext">3</span>And after they had fasted and prayed, they laid their hands on them and sent them off.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a></p><p class="hdg">On Cyprus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So Barnabas and Saul, sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a><span class="reftext">5</span>When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. And John was with them as their helper.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>They traveled through the whole island as far as Paphos, where they found a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a><span class="reftext">7</span>an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, a man of intelligence, summoned Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a><span class="reftext">8</span>But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked directly at Elymas
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a><span class="reftext">10</span>and said, “O child of the devil and enemy of all righteousness, you are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery! Will you never stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord?
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a><span class="reftext">11</span>Now look, the hand of the Lord is against you, and for a time you will be blind and unable to see the light of the sun.” Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a></p><p class="hdg">In Pisidian Antioch</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>After setting sail from Paphos, Paul and his companions came to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a><span class="reftext">14</span>And from Perga, they traveled inland to Pisidian Antioch, where they entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and sat down.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a><span class="reftext">15</span>After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders sent word to them: “Brothers, if you have a word of encouragement for the people, please speak.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and began to speak: “Men of Israel and you Gentiles who fear God, listen to me!
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a><span class="reftext">17</span>The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers. He made them into a great people during their stay in Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out of that land.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a><span class="reftext">18</span>He endured their conduct for about forty years in the wilderness.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a><span class="reftext">19</span>And having vanquished seven nations in Canaan, He gave their land to His people as an inheritance.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a><span class="reftext">20</span>All this took about 450 years. </p><p class="reg1"> After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="21"></a><span class="reftext">21</span>Then the people asked for a king, and God gave them forty years under Saul son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a><span class="reftext">22</span>After removing Saul, He raised up David as their king and testified about him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse a man after My own heart; he will carry out My will in its entirety.’<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">a</a></span>

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="24"></a><span class="reftext">24</span>Before the arrival of Jesus, John preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a><span class="reftext">25</span>As John was completing his course, he said, ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not that One.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="26"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Brothers, children of Abraham, and you Gentiles who fear God, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="27"></a><span class="reftext">27</span>The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning Him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="28"></a><span class="reftext">28</span>And though they found no ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have Him executed.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="29"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>When they had carried out all that was written about Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="30"></a><span class="reftext">30</span>But God raised Him from the dead,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="31"></a><span class="reftext">31</span>and for many days He was seen by those who had accompanied Him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now His witnesses to our people.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="32"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>And now we proclaim to you the good news: What God promised our fathers
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="33"></a><span class="reftext">33</span>He has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘You are My Son; </p><p class="indent"> today I have become Your Father.’<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">c</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="34"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>In fact, God raised Him from the dead, never to see decay.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="35"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>So also, He says in another Psalm: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘You will not let Your Holy One see decay.’<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">e</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="36"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>For when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep. His body was buried with his fathers and saw decay.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="37"></a><span class="reftext">37</span>But the One whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="38"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>Therefore let it be known to you, brothers, that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="39"></a><span class="reftext">39</span>Through Him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="40"></a><span class="reftext">40</span>Watch out, then, that what was spoken by the prophets does not happen to you:

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="43"></a><span class="reftext">43</span>After the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="44"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>On the following Sabbath, nearly the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="45"></a><span class="reftext">45</span>But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and they blasphemously contradicted what Paul was saying.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="46"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “It was necessary to speak the word of God to you first. But since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="47"></a><span class="reftext">47</span>For this is what the Lord has commanded us: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles, </p><p class="indent"> to bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">g</a></span>”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="48"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>When the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord, and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="49"></a><span class="reftext">49</span>And the word of the Lord spread throughout that region.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="50"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>The Jews, however, incited the religious women of prominence and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their district.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="51"></a><span class="reftext">51</span>So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="52"></a><span class="reftext">52</span>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</p></div><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> See <a href="249.htm#14" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">1 Samuel 13:14</a>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <a href="976.htm#16" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Luke 3:16</a>; see also <a href="932.htm#11" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Matthew 3:11</a>, <a href="958.htm#7" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Mark 1:7</a>, and <a href="998.htm#27" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">John 1:27</a>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <a href="480.htm#7" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Psalm 2:7</a>; literally <i class="calibre6">today I have begotten You</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">34</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">I will give you the holy, the trustworthy of David</i>; <a href="734.htm#3" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Isaiah 55:3</a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <a href="494.htm#10" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Psalm 16:10</a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">41</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <a href="904.htm#5" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Habakkuk 1:5</a> (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">47</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <a href="728.htm#6" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Isaiah 49:6</a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
