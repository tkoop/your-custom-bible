<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Paul’s First Missionary Journey Begins<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 15:36–41; Acts 18:23–28)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch), and Saul.
<span class="reftext">2</span>While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> said, “Set apart for <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”
<span class="reftext">3</span>And after they had fasted and prayed, they laid their hands on them and sent them off.
</p><p class="hdg">On Cyprus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So Barnabas and Saul, sent forth by the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus.
<span class="reftext">5</span>When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. And John was with them as their helper.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>They <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> through the whole island as far as Paphos, where they found a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus,
<span class="reftext">7</span>an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, a man of intelligence, summoned Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.
<span class="reftext">8</span>But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, looked directly at Elymas
<span class="reftext">10</span>and said, “O child of the devil and enemy of all righteousness, you are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery! Will you never stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord?
<span class="reftext">11</span>Now look, the hand of the Lord is against you, and for a time you will be blind and unable to see the light of the sun.” Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord.
</p><p class="hdg">In Pisidian Antioch</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>After setting sail from Paphos, Paul and his companions came to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And from Perga, they <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> inland to Pisidian Antioch, where they entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and sat down.
<span class="reftext">15</span>After the reading from the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> and the <span class='cap'>Prophets</span><span class='nocap'>prophets</span>, the synagogue leaders sent word to them: “Brothers, if you have a word of encouragement for the people, please speak.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and began to speak: “Men of Israel and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> Gentiles who fear God, listen to me!
<span class="reftext">17</span>The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers. He made them into a great people during their stay in Egypt, and with an uplifted arm <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> led them out of that land.
<span class="reftext">18</span>He endured their conduct for about forty years in the wilderness.
<span class="reftext">19</span>And having vanquished seven nations in Canaan, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> gave their land to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> people as an inheritance.
<span class="reftext">20</span>All this took about 450 years. </p><p class="reg1"> After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Then the people asked for a king, and God gave them forty years under Saul son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin.
<span class="reftext">22</span>After removing Saul, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> raised up David as their king and testified about him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse a man after <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> own heart; he will carry out <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> will in its entirety.’<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>From the descendants of this man, God has brought to Israel the <span class='spell ca'>Saviour</span><span class='spell gb'>Saviour</span><span class='spell us'><span class='cap'>Savior</span><span class='nocap'>savior</span></span> Jesus, as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> promised.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Before the arrival of Jesus, John preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
<span class="reftext">25</span>As John was completing his course, he said, ‘Who do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> suppose I am? I am not that <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span>. But <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Brothers, children of Abraham, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> Gentiles who fear God, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent.
<span class="reftext">27</span>The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not <span class='spell ca'>recognize</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognize</span> Jesus, yet in condemning <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.
<span class="reftext">28</span>And though they found no ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> executed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>When they had carried out all that was written about <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, they took <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> down from the tree and laid <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in a tomb.
<span class="reftext">30</span>But God raised <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> from the dead,
<span class="reftext">31</span>and for many days <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was seen by those who had accompanied <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> witnesses to our people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>And now we proclaim to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> the good news: What God promised our fathers
<span class="reftext">33</span><span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘You are <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span>; </p><p class="indent"> today I have become <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>.’<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>In fact, God raised <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> from the dead, never to see decay. As <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has said: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘I will give <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>So also, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> says in another Psalm: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘You will not let <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> see decay.’<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>For when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep. His body was buried with his fathers and saw decay.
<span class="reftext">37</span>But the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>Therefore let it be known to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, brothers, that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">39</span>Through <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> everyone who believes is justified from everything <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> could not be justified from by the law of Moses.
<span class="reftext">40</span>Watch out, then, that what was spoken by the prophets does not happen to you:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">41</span>‘Look, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> scoffers, </p><p class="indent"> wonder and perish! </p><p class="indent1"> For I am doing a work in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> days </p><p class="indent"> that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> would never believe, </p><p class="indent"> even if someone told <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.’<span class="fn">f</span>”
</p><p class="hdg">A Light for the Gentiles<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 49:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people urged them to continue this message on the next Sabbath.
<span class="reftext">43</span>After the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>On the following Sabbath, nearly the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
<span class="reftext">45</span>But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and they blasphemously contradicted what Paul was saying.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: “It was necessary to speak the word of God to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> first. But since <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.
<span class="reftext">47</span>For this is what the Lord has commanded us: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles, </p><p class="indent"> to bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’<span class="fn">g</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>When the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord, and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.
<span class="reftext">49</span>And the word of the Lord spread throughout that region.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>The Jews, however, incited the religious women of prominence and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of their district.
<span class="reftext">51</span>So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.
<span class="reftext">52</span>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> See 1 Samuel 13:14.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Luke 3:16; see also Matthew 3:11, Mark 1:7, and John 1:27.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Psalm 2:7; literally <i class="calibre6">today I have begotten You</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">34</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">I will give you the holy, the trustworthy of David</i>; Isaiah 55:3<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Psalm 16:10<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">41</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Habakkuk 1:5 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">47</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Isaiah 49:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
