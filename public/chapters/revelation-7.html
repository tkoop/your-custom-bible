<span class="reftext">2</span>And I saw another angel ascending from the east, with the seal of the living God. And he called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea:
<span class="reftext">3</span>“Do not harm the land or sea or trees until we have sealed the foreheads of the servants of our God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And I heard the number of those who were sealed, 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, </p><p class="indent1"> from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, </p><p class="indent1"> from the tribe of Gad 12,000,

</p><p class="hdg">Praise from the Great Multitude</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>After this I looked and saw a multitude too large to count, from every nation and tribe and people and tongue, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And they cried out in a loud voice: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Salvation to our God, </p><p class="indent"> who sits on the throne, </p><p class="indent"> and to the Lamb!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. And they fell facedown before the throne and worshiped God,
<span class="reftext">12</span>saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanks and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> and power and strength be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then one of the elders addressed me: “These in white robes,” he asked, “who are they, and where have they come from?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>“Sir,” I answered, “you know.” </p><p class="reg1"> So he replied, “These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
