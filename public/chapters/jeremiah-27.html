<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Yoke of Nebuchadnezzar</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah<span class="fn">a</span>  son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">2</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me: </p><p class="reg1">“Make for yourself a yoke out of leather straps and put it on your neck.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Give them a message from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, to relay to their masters:
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>By <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> great power and outstretched arm, I made the earth and the men and beasts on the face of it, and I give it to whom I please.
<span class="reftext">6</span>So now I have placed all these lands under the authority of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. I have even made the beasts of the field subject to him.
<span class="reftext">7</span>All nations will serve him and his son and grandson, until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings will enslave him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>As for the nation or kingdom that does not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and does not place its neck under his yoke, I will punish that nation by sword and famine and plague, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, until I have destroyed it by his hand.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>But as for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, do not listen to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> prophets, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> diviners, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> interpreters of dreams, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> mediums, or <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sorcerers who declare, ‘<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> will not serve the king of Babylon.’
<span class="reftext">10</span>For they prophesy to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> a lie that will serve to remove <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from your land; I will banish you and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will perish.
<span class="reftext">11</span>But the nation that will put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave in its own land, to cultivate it and reside in it, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And to Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke the same message: “Put <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and live!
<span class="reftext">13</span>Why should you and your people die by sword and famine and plague, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has decreed against any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say, ‘<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> must not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> a lie.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For I have not sent them, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and yet they are prophesying falsely in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name; therefore I will banish <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will perish—<span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and the prophets who prophesy to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then I said to the priests and to all this people, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: Do not listen to the words of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> prophets who prophesy to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, saying, ‘Look, very soon now the articles from the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will be brought back from Babylon.’ They are prophesying to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> a lie.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and live! Why should this city become a ruin?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>If they are indeed prophets and the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is with them, let them now plead with <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts that the articles remaining in the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, not be taken to Babylon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says about the pillars, the sea, the bases, and the rest of the articles that remain in this city,
<span class="reftext">20</span>which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he carried Jeconiah<span class="fn">c</span>  son of Jehoiakim king of Judah into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Yes, this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says about the articles that remain in the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:
<span class="reftext">22</span>‘They will be carried to Babylon and will remain there until the day I attend to them again,’ declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. ‘Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> A few Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac (see also verses 3 and 12, and Jeremiah 28:1); most Hebrew manuscripts <i class="calibre6">Jehoiakim</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Most LXX manuscripts do not include this verse.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Jeconiah</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jehoiachin</i>; see 2 Kings 24:12.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
