<font ><b>The Yoke of Nebuchadnezzar</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah
son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the
LORD. This is what the LORD said to me: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Make for yourself a yoke out of leather
straps and put it on your neck. Send word to the kings of Edom, Moab,
Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem
to Zedekiah king of Judah. Give them a message from the LORD of
Hosts, the God of Israel, to relay to their masters: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >By My great power and outstretched arm, I
made the earth and the men and beasts on the face of it, and I give
it to whom I please. So now I have placed all these lands under the
authority of My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. I have even
made the beasts of the field subject to him. All nations will serve
him and his son and grandson, until the time of his own land comes;
then many nations and great kings will enslave him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the nation or kingdom that does not
serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and does not place its neck
under his yoke, I will punish that nation by sword and famine and
plague, declares the LORD, until I have destroyed it by his hand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But as for you, do not listen to your
prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums,
or your sorcerers who declare, ‘You will not serve the king of
Babylon.’ For they prophesy to you a lie that will serve to remove
you from your land; I will banish you and you will perish. But the
nation that will put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon
and serve him, I will leave in its own land, to cultivate it and
reside in it, declares the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And to Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke the
same message: “Put your necks under the yoke of the king of
Babylon; serve him and his people, and live! Why should you and your
people die by sword and famine and plague, as the LORD has decreed
against any nation that does not serve the king of Babylon? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not listen to the words of the prophets
who say, ‘You must not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are
prophesying to you a lie. For I have not sent them, declares the
LORD, and yet they are prophesying falsely in My name; therefore I
will banish you, and you will perish—you and the prophets who
prophesy to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I said to the priests and to all this
people, “This is what the LORD says: Do not listen to the words of
your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, ‘Look, very soon now the
articles from the house of the LORD will be brought back from
Babylon.’ They are prophesying to you a lie. Do not listen to them.
Serve the king of Babylon and live! Why should this city become a
ruin? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If they are indeed prophets and the word
of the LORD is with them, let them now plead with the LORD of Hosts
that the articles remaining in the house of the LORD, in the palace
of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, not be taken to Babylon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this is what the LORD of Hosts says
about the pillars, the sea, the bases, and the rest of the articles
that remain in this city, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did
not take when he carried Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah into
exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah
and Jerusalem. Yes, this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of
Israel, says about the articles that remain in the house of the LORD,
in the palace of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem: ‘They will be
carried to Babylon and will remain there until the day I attend to
them again,’ declares the LORD. ‘Then I will bring them back and
restore them to this place.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
