<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Sower<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 4:1–9; Luke 8:4–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Such large crowds gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat down, while all the people stood on the shore.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And He told them many things in parables, saying, <span>“A farmer went out to sow his seed.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">5</span>Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But when the sun rose, the seedlings were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">7</span>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">8</span>Still other seed fell on good soil and produced a crop—a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">9</span>He who has ears,<span class="fn">a</span>  let him hear.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Purpose of Jesus’ Parables<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 6:1–13; Mark 4:10–12; Luke 8:9–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do You speak to the people in parables?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>He replied, <span>“The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
<span class="reftext">13</span>This is why I speak to them in parables:</span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘Though seeing, they do not see; </p><p class="indentred"> though hearing, they do not hear or understand.’<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">14</span>In them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled: </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding; </p><p class="indentred"> you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">15</span>For this people’s heart has grown callous; </p><p class="indentred"> they hardly hear with their ears, </p><p class="indentred"> and they have closed their eyes. </p><p class="indentred1"> Otherwise they might see with their eyes, </p><p class="indentred"> hear with their ears, </p><p class="indentred"> understand with their hearts, </p><p class="indentred1"> and turn, and I would heal them.’<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">16</span>But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Sower Explained<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 4:13–20; Luke 8:11–15)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">18</span>Consider, then, the parable of the sower:
<span class="reftext">19</span>When anyone hears the message of the kingdom but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown<span class="fn">d</span>  along the path.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">20</span>The seed sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.
<span class="reftext">21</span>But since he has no root, he remains for only a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">22</span>The seed sown among the thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">23</span>But the seed sown on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and produces a crop—a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Weeds<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Ezekiel 17:1–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Jesus put before them another parable: <span>“The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
<span class="reftext">25</span>But while everyone was asleep, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and slipped away.
<span class="reftext">26</span>When the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds also appeared.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">27</span>The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>‘An enemy did this,’ he replied. </p><p class="calibre3"> So the servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">29</span>‘No,’ he said, ‘if you pull the weeds now, you might uproot the wheat with them.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat into my barn.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Mustard Seed<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 4:30–34; Luke 13:18–19)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>He put before them another parable: <span>“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man planted in his field.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Although it is the smallest of all seeds, yet it grows into the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Leaven<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 13:20–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>He told them still another parable: <span>“The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">I Will Open My Mouth in Parables<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 78:1–72)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables. He did not tell them anything without using a parable.
<span class="reftext">35</span>So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I will open My mouth in parables; </p><p class="indent"> I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Weeds Explained<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Zephaniah 1:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to Him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>He replied, <span>“The One who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.
<span class="reftext">38</span>The field is the world, and the good seed represents the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,
<span class="reftext">39</span>and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">40</span>As the weeds are collected and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age.
<span class="reftext">41</span>The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out of His kingdom every cause of sin and all who practice lawlessness.
<span class="reftext">42</span>And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
<span class="reftext">43</span>Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.<span class="fn">f</span>  </p><p class="calibre3"> He who has ears, let him hear.
</p><p class="hdg">The Parables of the Treasure and the Pearl</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">44</span>The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and in his joy he went and sold all he had and bought that field.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">45</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.
<span class="reftext">46</span>When he found one very precious pearl, he went away and sold all he had and bought it.
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Net</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">47</span>Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and caught all kinds of fish.
<span class="reftext">48</span>When it was full, the men pulled it ashore. Then they sat down and sorted the good fish into containers, but threw the bad away.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">49</span>So will it be at the end of the age: The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous,
<span class="reftext">50</span>and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">51</span>Have you understood all these things?” </p><p class="reg1">“Yes,” they answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">52</span>Then He told them, <span>“For this reason, every scribe who has been discipled in the kingdom of heaven is like a homeowner who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Rejection at Nazareth<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 6:1–6; Luke 4:16–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">53</span>When Jesus had finished these parables, He withdrew from that place.
<span class="reftext">54</span>Coming to His hometown, He taught the people in their synagogue, and they were astonished. “Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?” they asked.
<span class="reftext">55</span>“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t His mother’s name Mary, and aren’t His brothers James, Joseph,<span class="fn">g</span>  Simon, and Judas?
<span class="reftext">56</span>Aren’t all His sisters with us as well? Where then did this man get all these things?”
<span class="reftext">57</span>And they took offense at Him. </p><p class="reg1"> But Jesus said to them, <span>“Only in his hometown and in his own household is a prophet without honor.”</span>
<span class="reftext">58</span>And He did not do many miracles there, because of their unbelief.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">ears to hear</i>; also in verse 43<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> See Deuteronomy 29:4, Isaiah 42:20, Jeremiah 5:21, and Ezekiel 12:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Isaiah 6:9–10 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the one sown</i>; also in verses 20, 22, and 23<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Psalm 78:2 (see also LXX); SBL, NE, and WH do not include <i class="calibre6">of the world</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">43</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> See Daniel 12:3.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">55</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">Joses</i>; see Mark 6:3.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
