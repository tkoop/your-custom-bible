<font ><b>The Parables of Jesus</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That same day Jesus went out of the house
and sat by the sea. Such large crowds gathered around Him that He got
into a boat and sat down, while all the people stood on the shore. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And He told them many things in parables,
saying, <font color="#a80000">“A farmer went out to sow his seed.
And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds
came and devoured it.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Some fell on rocky
ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because
the soil was shallow. But when the sun rose, the seedlings were
scorched, and they withered because they had no root. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Other seed fell
among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Still other seed
fell on good soil and produced a crop—a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or
thirtyfold. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >He who has ears, let
him hear.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the disciples came to Jesus and
asked, “Why do You speak to the people in parables?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He replied, <font color="#a80000">“The
knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been given to
you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and he will
have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be
taken away from him. This is why I speak to them in parables:</font> </font>

their eyes. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

see with their eyes, </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >But blessed are your
eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. For truly I
tell you, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see
but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Consider, then, the
parable of the sower: When anyone hears the message of the kingdom
but does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what
was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The seed sown on
rocky ground is the one who hears the word and at once receives it
with joy. But since he has no root, he remains for only a season.
When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly
falls away. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The seed sown among
the thorns is the one who hears the word, but the worries of this
life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes
unfruitful. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But the seed sown on
good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed
bears fruit and produces a crop—a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or
thirtyfold.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus put before them another parable:
<font color="#a80000">“The kingdom of heaven is like a man who
sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was asleep, his
enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and slipped away. When
the wheat sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds also appeared.</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The owner’s
servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in
your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >An enemy did
this,’ he replied. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >So the servants
asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >No,’ he said,
‘if you pull the weeds now, you might uproot the wheat with them.
Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell
the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be
burned; then gather the wheat into my barn.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He put before them another parable: <font color="#a80000">“The
kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man planted in his
field. Although it is the smallest of all seeds, yet it grows into
the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of
the air come and nest in its branches.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He told them still another parable: <font color="#a80000">“The
kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and mixed into
three measures of flour, until all of it was leavened.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds
in parables. He did not tell them anything without using a parable.
So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >I will open My mouth in parables; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will utter things hidden since the
foundation of the world.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus dismissed the crowds and went
into the house. His disciples came to Him and said, “Explain to us
the parable of the weeds in the field.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He replied, <font color="#a80000">“The
One who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. The field is the world,
and the good seed represents the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are
the sons of the evil one, and the enemy who sows them is the devil.
The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >As the weeds are
collected and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the
age. The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will weed out
of His kingdom every cause of sin and all who practice lawlessness.
And they will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the
sun in the kingdom of their Father. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >He who has ears, let
him hear. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The kingdom of
heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he
hid it again, and in his joy he went and sold all he had and bought
that field. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Again, the kingdom
of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls. When he found
one very precious pearl, he went away and sold all he had and bought
it. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Once again, the
kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and caught
all kinds of fish. When it was full, the men pulled it ashore. Then
they sat down and sorted the good fish into containers, but threw the
bad away. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >So will it be at the
end of the age: The angels will come and separate the wicked from the
righteous, and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Have you understood
all these things?” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Yes,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He told them, <font color="#a80000">“For
this reason, every scribe who has been discipled in the kingdom of
heaven is like a homeowner who brings out of his storeroom new
treasures as well as old.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus had finished these parables, He
withdrew from that place. Coming to His hometown, He taught the
people in their synagogue, and they were astonished. “Where did
this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?” they asked. “Isn’t
this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t His mother’s name Mary, and
aren’t His brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? Aren’t all
His sisters with us as well? Where then did this man get all these
things?” And they took offense at Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Only
in his hometown and in his own household is a prophet without honor.”</font>
And He did not do many miracles there, because of their unbelief. </font>
