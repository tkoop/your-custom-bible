Edom). Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah
daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah daughter of Anah and
granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite, and Basemath daughter of Ishmael
and sister of Nebaioth. And Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath gave
birth to Reuel, and Oholibamah gave birth to Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.

Canaan. </font>

daughters and all the people of his household, along with his
livestock, all his other animals, and all the property he had
acquired in Canaan, and he moved to a land far away from his brother
Jacob. For their possessions were too great for them to dwell
together; the land where they stayed could not support them because
of their livestock. So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the area of
Mount Seir. </font>
