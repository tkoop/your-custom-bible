<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus called the Twelve together and
gave them power and authority over all demons, and power to cure
diseases. And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to
heal the sick. <font color="#a80000">“Take nothing for the
journey,”</font> He told them, <font color="#a80000">“no staff,
no bag, no bread, no money, no second tunic. Whatever house you
enter, stay there until you leave that area. If anyone does not
welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that town,
as a testimony against them.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they set out and went from village to
village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Herod the tetrarch heard about all
that was happening, he was perplexed. For some were saying that John
had risen from the dead, others that Elijah had appeared, and still
others that a prophet of old had arisen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I beheaded John,” Herod said, “but
who is this man I hear such things about?” And he kept trying to
see Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the apostles returned and reported to
Jesus all that they had done. Taking them away privately, He withdrew
to a town called Bethsaida. But the crowds found out and followed
Him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and
He healed those who needed healing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the day neared its end, the Twelve came
to Jesus and said, “Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the
surrounding villages and countryside for lodging and provisions. For
we are in a desolate place here.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“You
give them something to eat.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >We have only five loaves of bread and
two fish,” they answered, “unless we go and buy food for all
these people.” (There were about five thousand men.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He told His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“Have
them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”</font> They did so,
and everyone was seated. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Taking the five loaves and the two fish
and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke them. Then
He gave them to the disciples to set before the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They all ate and were satisfied, and the
disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left
over. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One day as Jesus was praying in private
and the disciples were with Him, He questioned them: <font color="#a80000">“Who
do the crowds say I am?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They replied, “Some say John the
Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that a prophet of old
has arisen.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >But what about
you?”</font> Jesus asked. <font color="#a80000">“Who do you say I
am?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus strictly warned them not to tell
this to anyone. <font color="#a80000">“The Son of Man must suffer
many things,”</font> He said. <font color="#a80000">“He must be
rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and He must be
killed and on the third day be raised to life.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to all of them, <font color="#a80000">“If
anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his
cross daily and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his life will
lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >What does it profit
a man to gain the whole world, yet lose or forfeit his very self? If
anyone is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will be ashamed
of him when He comes in His glory and in the glory of the Father and
of the holy angels. But I tell you truthfully, some who are standing
here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >About eight days after Jesus had said
these things, He took with Him Peter, John, and James, and went up on
a mountain to pray. And as He was praying, the appearance of His face
changed, and His clothes became radiantly white. Suddenly two men,
Moses and Elijah, began talking with Jesus. They appeared in glory
and spoke about His departure, which He was about to accomplish at
Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile Peter and his companions were
overcome by sleep, but when they awoke, they saw Jesus’ glory and
the two men standing with Him. As Moses and Elijah were leaving,
Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us
put up three shelters—one for You, one for Moses, and one for
Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Peter was speaking, a cloud appeared
and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, whom I
have chosen. Listen to Him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After the voice had spoken, only Jesus was
present with them. The disciples kept this to themselves, and in
those days they did not tell anyone what they had seen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day, when they came down from the
mountain, Jesus was met by a large crowd. Suddenly a man in the crowd
cried out, “Teacher, I beg You to look at my son, for he is my only
child. A spirit keeps seizing him, and he screams abruptly. It throws
him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It keeps mauling
him and rarely departs from him. I begged Your disciples to drive it
out, but they were unable.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >O unbelieving and
perverse generation!”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“How
long must I remain with you and put up with you? Bring your son
here.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Even while the boy was approaching, the
demon slammed him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked
the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And they were all astonished at the
greatness of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While everyone was marveling at all that
Jesus was doing, He said to His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“Let
these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be
delivered into the hands of men.”</font> But they did not
understand this statement. It was veiled from them so that they could
not comprehend it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then an argument started among the
disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. But Jesus,
knowing the thoughts of their hearts, had a little child stand beside
Him. And He said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Whoever welcomes
this little child in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me
welcomes the One who sent Me. For whoever is the least among all of
you, he is the greatest.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Master,” said John, “we saw someone
driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he
does not accompany us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Do not stop him,”</font>
Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“for whoever is not against
you is for you.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the day of His ascension approached,
Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. He sent messengers on ahead,
who went into a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements for
Him. But the people there refused to welcome Him, because He was
heading for Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the disciples James and John saw
this, they asked, “Lord, do You want us to call down fire from
heaven to consume them?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus turned and rebuked them. And He
and His disciples went on to another village. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As they were walking along the road,
someone said to Jesus, “I will follow You wherever You go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Foxes
have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no
place to lay His head.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He said to another man, <font color="#a80000">“Follow
Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The man replied, “Lord, first let me go
and bury my father.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus told him, <font color="#a80000">“Let
the dead bury their own dead. You, however, go and proclaim the
kingdom of God.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Still another said, “I will follow You,
Lord; but first let me bid farewell to my family.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus declared, <font color="#a80000">“No
one who puts his hand to the plow and then looks back is fit for the
kingdom of God.”</font> </font>
