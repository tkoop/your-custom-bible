<font ><b>The Defeat of Og</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then we turned and went up the road to
Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army came out to meet us
in battle at Edrei. But the LORD said to me, “Do not fear him, for
I have delivered him into your hand, along with all his people and
his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who
lived in Heshbon.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the LORD our God also delivered Og king
of Bashan and his whole army into our hands. We struck them down
until no survivor was left. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time we captured all sixty of his
cities. There was not a single city we failed to take—the entire
region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. All these cities were
fortified with high walls and gates and bars, and there were many
more unwalled villages. We devoted them to destruction, as we had
done to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and
children of every city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But all the livestock and plunder of the
cities we carried off for ourselves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time we took from the two kings of
the Amorites the land across the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley as far
as Mount Hermon— which the Sidonians call Sirion but the Amorites
call Senir— all the cities of the plateau, all of Gilead, and all
of Bashan as far as the cities of Salecah and Edrei in the kingdom of
Og. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >(For only Og king of Bashan had remained
of the remnant of the Rephaim. His bed of iron, nine cubits long and
four cubits wide, is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So at that time we took possession of this
land. To the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the land beyond Aroer
along the Arnon Valley, and half the hill country of Gilead, along
with its cities. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >To the half-tribe of Manasseh I gave the
rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og. (The entire
region of Argob, the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the
land of the Rephaim.) Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole
region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and
Maacathites. He renamed Bashan after himself, Havvoth-jair, by which
it is called to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >To Machir I gave Gilead, and to the
Reubenites and Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead to the Arnon
Valley (the middle of the valley was the border) and up to the Jabbok
River, the border of the Ammonites. The Jordan River in the Arabah
bordered it from Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea)
with the slopes of Pisgah to the east. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time I commanded you: “The LORD
your God has given you this land to possess. All your men of valor
are to cross over, armed for battle, ahead of your brothers, the
Israelites. But your wives, your children, and your livestock—I
know that you have much livestock—may remain in the cities I have
given you, until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as He has to
you, and they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD
your God is giving them across the Jordan. Then each of you may
return to the possession I have given you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And at that time I commanded Joshua: “Your
own eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two
kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to
enter. Do not be afraid of them, for the LORD your God Himself will
fight for you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time I also pleaded with the LORD:
“O Lord GOD, You have begun to show Your greatness and power to
Your servant. For what god in heaven or on earth can perform such
works and mighty acts as Yours? Please let me cross over and see the
good land beyond the Jordan—that pleasant hill country as well as
Lebanon!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the LORD was angry with me on account
of you, and He would not listen to me. “That is enough,” the LORD
said to me. “Do not speak to Me again about this matter. Go to the
top of Pisgah and look to the west and north and south and east. See
the land with your own eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan. But
commission Joshua, encourage him, and strengthen him, for he will
cross over ahead of the people and enable them to inherit the land
that you will see.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So we stayed in the valley opposite
Beth-peor. </font>
