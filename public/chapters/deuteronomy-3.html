<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Defeat of Og<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 21:31–35)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army came out to meet us in battle at Edrei.
<span class="reftext">2</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me, “Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, along with all his people and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God also delivered Og king of Bashan and his whole army into our hands. We struck them down until no survivor was left.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>At that time we captured all sixty of his cities. There was not a single city we failed to take—the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
<span class="reftext">5</span>All these cities were fortified with high walls and gates and bars, and there were many more unwalled villages.
<span class="reftext">6</span>We devoted them to destruction,<span class="fn">a</span>  as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>But all the livestock and plunder of the cities we carried off for ourselves.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>At that time we took from the two kings of the Amorites the land across the Jordan, from the Arnon <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span> as far as Mount Hermon—
<span class="reftext">9</span>which the Sidonians call Sirion but the Amorites call Senir—
<span class="reftext">10</span>all the cities of the plateau, all of Gilead, and all of Bashan as far as the cities of Salecah and Edrei in the kingdom of Og.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>(For only Og king of Bashan had remained of the remnant of the Rephaim. His bed of iron, nine cubits long and four cubits wide,<span class="fn">b</span>  is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)
</p><p class="hdg">Land Division East of the Jordan<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 32:1–42; Joshua 13:8–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So at that time we took possession of this land. To the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the land beyond Aroer along the Arnon <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span>, and half the hill country of Gilead, along with its cities.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>To the half-tribe of Manasseh I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og. (The entire region of Argob, the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the land of the Rephaim.)
<span class="reftext">14</span>Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. He renamed Bashan after himself, Havvoth-jair,<span class="fn">c</span>  by which it is called to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>To Machir I gave Gilead,
<span class="reftext">16</span>and to the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead to the Arnon <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span> (the middle of the valley was the border) and up to the Jabbok River, the border of the Ammonites.
<span class="reftext">17</span>The Jordan River in the Arabah bordered it from Chinnereth to the <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span> of the Arabah (the <span class='cap'>Salt</span><span class='nocap'>salt</span> <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span><span class="fn">d</span>) with the slopes of Pisgah to the east.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>At that time I commanded <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>: “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God has given <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> this land to possess. All your men of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span> are to cross over, armed for battle, ahead of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers, the Israelites.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> wives, your children, and <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> livestock—I know that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have much livestock—may remain in the cities I have given <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>,
<span class="reftext">20</span>until <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gives rest to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and they too have taken possession of the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God is giving them across the Jordan. Then each of you may return to the possession I have given <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>And at that time I commanded Joshua: “Your own eyes have seen all that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God has done to these two kings. <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will do the same to all the kingdoms you are about to enter.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Do not be afraid of them, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> will fight for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”
</p><p class="hdg">Moses Forbidden to Cross the Jordan<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 27:12–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>At that time I also pleaded with <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>:
<span class="reftext">24</span>“O Lord GOD, <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have begun to show <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> greatness and power to <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> servant. For what god in heaven or on earth can perform such works and mighty acts as <span class='cap'>Yours</span><span class='nocap'>yours</span>?
<span class="reftext">25</span>Please let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that pleasant hill country as well as Lebanon!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was angry with me on account of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> would not listen to me. “That is enough,” <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me. “Do not speak to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> again about this matter.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Go to the top of Pisgah and look to the west and north and south and east. See the land with your own eyes, for you will not cross this Jordan.
<span class="reftext">28</span>But commission Joshua, encourage him, and strengthen him, for he will cross over ahead of the people and enable them to inherit the land that you will see.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth-peor.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">cherem</i> refer to the giving over of things or persons to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Og’s bed was approximately 14 feet long and 6 feet wide (4.3 meters long and 1.8 meters wide).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the villages of Jair</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> That is, the Dead Sea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
