<font ><b>Huldah’s Prophecy</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Josiah was eight years old when he became
king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother’s
name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah; she was from Bozkath. And he did
what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in all the ways of
his father David; he did not turn aside to the right or to the left. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now in the eighteenth year of his reign,
King Josiah sent the scribe, Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of
Meshullam, to the house of the LORD, saying, “Go up to Hilkiah the
high priest and have him count the money that has been brought into
the house of the LORD, which the doorkeepers have collected from the
people. And let them deliver it into the hands of the supervisors of
those doing the work on the house of the LORD, who in turn are to
give it to the workmen repairing the damages to the house of the
LORD— to the carpenters, builders, and masons—to buy timber and
dressed stone to repair the temple. But they need not account for the
money put into their hands, since they work with integrity.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Hilkiah the high priest said to
Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in the house
of the LORD!” And he gave it to Shaphan, who read it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Shaphan the scribe went to the king
and reported, “Your servants have paid out the money that was found
in the temple and have put it into the hands of the workers and
supervisors of the house of the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the
king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read
it in the presence of the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the king heard the words of the Book
of the Law, he tore his clothes and commanded Hilkiah the priest,
Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and
Asaiah the servant of the king: “Go and inquire of the LORD for me,
for the people, and for all Judah concerning the words in this book
that has been found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that burns
against us because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book
by doing all that is written about us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor,
Shaphan, and Asaiah went and spoke to Huldah the prophetess, the wife
of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, the keeper of the
wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Huldah said to them, “This is what
the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Tell the man who sent you that
this is what the LORD says: I am about to bring calamity on this
place and on its people, according to all the words of the book that
the king of Judah has read, because they have forsaken Me and burned
incense to other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all
the works of their hands. My wrath will be kindled against this place
and will not be quenched.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But as for the king of Judah, who sent you
to inquire of the LORD, tell him that this is what the LORD, the God
of Israel, says: ‘As for the words that you heard, because your
heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you
heard what I spoke against this place and against its people, that
they would become a desolation and a curse, and because you have torn
your clothes and wept before Me, I have heard you,’ declares the
LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
‘<font >Therefore I will indeed gather you to
your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your
eyes will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this
place.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they brought her answer back to the
king. </font>
