<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Grace and Perseverance<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Hebrews 12:1–3)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>You therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And the things that you have heard me say among many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be qualified to teach others as well.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Join me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
<span class="reftext">4</span>A soldier refrains from entangling himself in civilian affairs, in order to please the one who enlisted him.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Likewise, a competitor does not receive the crown unless he competes according to the rules.
<span class="reftext">6</span>The hardworking farmer should be the first to partake of the crops.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Consider what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all things.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David, as proclaimed by my gospel,
<span class="reftext">9</span>for which I suffer to the extent of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God cannot be chained!
<span class="reftext">10</span>For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>This is a trustworthy saying: </p><p class="indent1stline"> If we died with Him, </p><p class="indent"> we will also live with Him;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>if we endure, </p><p class="indent"> we will also reign with Him; </p><p class="indent1"> if we deny Him, </p><p class="indent"> He will also deny us;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>if we are faithless, </p><p class="indent"> He remains faithful, </p><p class="indent"> for He cannot deny Himself.
</p><p class="hdg">The Lord’s Approved Workman</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Remind the believers of these things, charging them before God<span class="fn">a</span>  to avoid quarreling over words, which succeeds only in leading the listeners to ruin.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Make every effort to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman who accurately handles the word of truth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But avoid irreverent, empty chatter, which will only lead to more ungodliness,
<span class="reftext">17</span>and the talk of such men will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
<span class="reftext">18</span>who have deviated from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already occurred, and they undermine the faith of some.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Nevertheless, God’s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,”<span class="fn">b</span>  and, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from iniquity.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>A large house contains not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay. Some indeed are for <span class='spell ca'>honourable</span><span class='spell gb'>honourable</span><span class='spell us'>honorable</span> use, but others are for common use.
<span class="reftext">21</span>So if anyone cleanses himself of what is unfit,<span class="fn">c</span>  he will be a vessel for <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span>: sanctified, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Flee from youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, together with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But reject foolish and ignorant speculation, for you know that it breeds quarreling.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And a servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome, but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, and forbearing.
<span class="reftext">25</span>He must gently reprove those who oppose him, in the hope that God may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Then they will come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, who has taken them captive to his will.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> SBL, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">the Lord</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Numbers 16:5 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">cleanses himself of these</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
