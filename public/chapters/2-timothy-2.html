civilian affairs, in order to please the one who enlisted him.
Likewise, a competitor does not receive the crown unless he competes

in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. </font>

<font >A large house contains not only vessels of
gold and silver, but also of wood and clay. Some indeed are for

<font >But reject foolish and ignorant
speculation, for you know that it breeds quarreling. And a servant of
the Lord must not be quarrelsome, but must be kind to everyone, able
to teach, and forbearing. He must gently reprove those who oppose
him, in the hope that God may grant them repentance leading to a
knowledge of the truth. Then they will come to their senses and
escape the snare of the devil, who has taken them captive to his
will. </font>
