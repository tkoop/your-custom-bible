<span class="reftext">2</span>Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but think of yourself with sober judgment, according to the measure of faith God has given you.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Just as each of us has one body with many members, and not all members have the same function,
<span class="reftext">5</span>so in Christ we who are many are one body, and each member belongs to one another.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>We have different gifts according to the grace given us. If one’s gift is prophecy, let him use it in proportion to his faith;
<span class="reftext">7</span>if it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach;
<span class="reftext">8</span>if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is giving, let him give generously; if it is leading, let him lead with diligence; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.

<span class="reftext">10</span>Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Outdo yourselves in honouring one another.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Do not let your zeal subside; keep your spiritual fervour, serving the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, persistent in prayer.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Share with the saints who are in need. Practice hospitality.

<span class="reftext">15</span>Rejoice with those who rejoice; weep with those who weep.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but enjoy the company of the lowly. Do not be conceited.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Carefully consider what is right in the eyes of everybody.
<span class="reftext">18</span>If it is possible on your part, live at peace with everyone.
