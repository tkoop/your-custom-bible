<font >Therefore I urge you, brothers, on account
of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and
pleasing to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. Do not
be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of
your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what is the
good, pleasing, and perfect will of God. </font>

<font >For by the grace given me I say to every
one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but
think of yourself with sober judgment, according to the measure of
faith God has given you. Just as each of us has one body with many
members, and not all members have the same function, so in Christ we
who are many are one body, and each member belongs to one another. </font>

<font >We have different gifts according to the
grace given us. If one’s gift is prophecy, let him use it in
proportion to his faith; if it is serving, let him serve; if it is
teaching, let him teach; if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if
it is giving, let him give generously; if it is leading, let him lead
with diligence; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully. </font>

cling to what is good. Be devoted to one another in brotherly love.
Outdo yourselves in honoring one another. </font>
