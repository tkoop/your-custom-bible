<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Elihu Rebukes Job</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>“But now, O Job, hear my speech, </p><p class="indent"> and listen to all my words.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Behold, I will open my mouth; </p><p class="indent"> my address is on the tip of my tongue.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>My words are from an upright heart, </p><p class="indent"> and my lips speak sincerely what I know.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>The <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of God has made me, </p><p class="indent"> and the breath of the <span class='cap'>Almighty</span><span class='nocap'>almighty</span> gives me life.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Refute me if you can; </p><p class="indent"> prepare your case and confront me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>I am just like you before God; </p><p class="indent"> I was also formed from clay.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Surely no fear of me should terrify you; </p><p class="indent"> nor will my hand be heavy upon you.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Surely you have spoken in my hearing, </p><p class="indent"> and I have heard these very words:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>‘I am pure, without transgression; </p><p class="indent"> I am clean, with no iniquity in me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Yet God finds occasions against me; </p><p class="indent"> He counts me as <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> enemy.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>He puts my feet in the stocks; </p><p class="indent"> He watches over all my paths.’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>Behold, you are not right in this matter. </p><p class="indent"> I will answer you, for God is greater than man.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Why do you complain to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> </p><p class="indent"> that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> answers nothing a man asks?<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>For God speaks in one way and in another, </p><p class="indent"> yet no one notices.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>In a dream, </p><p class="indent"> in a vision in the night, </p><p class="indent1"> when deep sleep falls upon men </p><p class="indent"> as they slumber on their beds,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>He opens their ears </p><p class="indent"> and terrifies them with warnings
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>to turn a man from wrongdoing </p><p class="indent"> and keep him from pride,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>to preserve his soul from the Pit </p><p class="indent"> and his life from perishing by the sword.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>A man is also chastened on his bed </p><p class="indent"> with pain and constant distress in his bones,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>so that he detests his bread, </p><p class="indent"> and his soul loathes his <span class='spell ca'>favourite</span><span class='spell gb'>favourite</span><span class='spell us'>favorite</span> food.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>His flesh wastes away from sight, </p><p class="indent"> and his hidden bones protrude.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>He draws near to the Pit, </p><p class="indent"> and his life to the messengers of death.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>Yet if there is a messenger on his side, </p><p class="indent"> one mediator in a thousand, </p><p class="indent1"> to tell a man what is right for him,
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">24</span>to be gracious to him and say, </p><p class="indent1">‘Spare him from going down to the Pit; </p><p class="indent"> I have found his ransom,’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>then his flesh is refreshed like a child’s; </p><p class="indent"> he returns to the days of his youth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>He prays to God and finds <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span>; </p><p class="indent"> he sees God’s face and shouts for joy, </p><p class="indent1"> and God restores <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> righteousness </p><p class="indent"> to that man.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then he sings before<span class="fn">b</span>  men </p><p class="indent"> with these words: </p><p class="indent1">‘I have sinned and perverted what was right; </p><p class="indent"> yet I did not get what I deserved.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, </p><p class="indent"> and I will live to see the light.’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">29</span>Behold, all these things God does to a man, </p><p class="indent"> two or even three times,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>to bring back his soul from the Pit, </p><p class="indent"> that he may be enlightened with the light of life.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; </p><p class="indent"> be silent, and I will speak.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>But if you have something to say, answer me; </p><p class="indent"> speak up, for I would like to vindicate you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>But if not, then listen to me; </p><p class="indent"> be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">that He answers for none of His actions</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Then he looks upon</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
