<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
the Israelites and tell them: After you enter the land that I am
giving you as a home and you present an offering made by fire to the
LORD from the herd or flock to produce a pleasing aroma to the
LORD—either a burnt offering or a sacrifice, for a special vow or
freewill offering or appointed feast— then the one presenting his
offering to the LORD shall also present a grain offering of a tenth
of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter hin of olive oil. With
the burnt offering or sacrifice of each lamb, you are to prepare a
quarter hin of wine as a drink offering. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">With a ram you are to prepare a grain
offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third
of a hin of olive oil, and a third of a hin of wine as a drink
offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When you prepare a young bull as a burnt
offering or sacrifice to fulfill a vow or as a peace offering to the
LORD, present with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an
ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of olive oil. Also present
half a hin of wine as a drink offering. It is an offering made by
fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. This is to be done for each bull,
ram, lamb, or goat. This is how you must prepare each one, no matter
how many. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Everyone who is native-born shall prepare
these things in this way when he presents an offering made by fire as
a pleasing aroma to the LORD. And for the generations to come, if a
foreigner residing with you or someone else among you wants to
prepare an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, he
is to do exactly as you do. The assembly is to have the same statute
both for you and for the foreign resident; it is a permanent statute
for the generations to come. You and the foreigner shall be the same
before the LORD. The same law and the same ordinance will apply both
to you and to the foreigner residing with you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
the Israelites and tell them: When you enter the land to which I am
bringing you and you eat the food of the land, you shall lift up an
offering to the LORD. From the first of your dough, you are to lift
up a cake as a contribution; offer it just like an offering from the
threshing floor. Throughout your generations, you are to give the
LORD an offering from the first of your dough. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now if you stray unintentionally and do
not obey all these commandments that the LORD has spoken to Moses—
all that the LORD has commanded you through Moses from the day the
LORD gave them and continuing through the generations to come— and
if it was done unintentionally without the knowledge of the
congregation, then the whole congregation is to prepare one young
bull as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the LORD, with its
grain offering and drink offering according to the regulation, and
one male goat as a sin offering. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The priest is to make atonement for the
whole congregation of Israel, so that they may be forgiven; for the
sin was unintentional and they have brought to the LORD an offering
made by fire and a sin offering, presented before the LORD for their
unintentional sin. Then the whole congregation of Israel and the
foreigners residing among them will be forgiven, since it happened to
all the people unintentionally. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Also, if one person sins unintentionally,
he is to present a year-old female goat as a sin offering. And the
priest shall make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the person
who erred by sinning unintentionally; and when atonement has been
made for him, he will be forgiven. You shall have the same law for
the one who acts in error, whether he is a native-born Israelite or a
foreigner residing among you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the person who sins defiantly, whether
a native or foreigner, blasphemes the LORD. That person shall be cut
off from among his people. He shall certainly be cut off, because he
has despised the word of the LORD and broken His commandment; his
guilt remains on him.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While the Israelites were in the
wilderness, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day. Those
who found the man gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and the
whole congregation, and because it had not been declared what should
be done to him, they placed him in custody. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD said to Moses, “The man
must surely be put to death. The whole congregation is to stone him
outside the camp.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the whole congregation took the man
outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD had commanded
Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Later, the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
the Israelites and tell them that throughout the generations to come
they are to make for themselves tassels for the corners of their
garments, with a blue cord on each tassel. These will serve as
tassels for you to look at, so that you may remember all the
commandments of the LORD, that you may obey them and not prostitute
yourselves by following your own heart and your own eyes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then you will remember and obey all My
commandments, and you will be holy to your God. I am the LORD your
God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the
LORD your God.” </font>
