<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the men of Kiriath-jearim came for
the ark of the LORD and took it into Abinadab’s house on the hill.
And they consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And from that day a long time passed,
twenty years in all, as the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim. And all
the house of Israel mourned and sought after the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Samuel said to all the house of
Israel, “If you are returning to the LORD with all your hearts,
then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and Ashtoreths among you,
prepare your hearts for the LORD, and serve Him only. And He will
deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the Israelites put away the Baals and
Ashtoreths and served only the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to
Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD on your behalf.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When they had gathered at Mizpah, they
drew water and poured it out before the LORD. On that day they
fasted, and there they confessed, “We have sinned against the
LORD.” And Samuel judged the Israelites at Mizpah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the Philistines heard that the
Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, their rulers marched up toward
Israel. And when the Israelites learned of this, they feared the
Philistines and said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the LORD
our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the
Philistines.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and
offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. He cried out to the
LORD on behalf of Israel, and the LORD answered him. As the
Philistines drew near to fight against Israel, Samuel was sacrificing
the burnt offering. But that day the LORD thundered loudly against
the Philistines and threw them into such confusion that they fled
before Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the men of Israel charged out of
Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, striking them down all the way to
an area below Beth-car. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Afterward, Samuel took a stone and set it
up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, “Thus far
the LORD has helped us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the Philistines were subdued, and they
stopped invading the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD
was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. The cities from
Ekron to Gath, which the Philistines had taken, were restored to
Israel, who also delivered the surrounding territory from the hand of
the Philistines. And there was peace between the Israelites and the
Amorites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Samuel judged Israel all the days of
his life. Every year he would go on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal
to Mizpah, judging Israel in all these places. Then he would return
to Ramah because his home was there, and there he judged Israel and
built an altar to the LORD. </font>
