<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Samuel Subdues the Philistines</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the men of Kiriath-jearim came for the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and took it into Abinadab’s house on the hill. And they consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And from that day a long time passed, twenty years in all, as the ark remained at Kiriath-jearim. And all the house of Israel mourned and sought after <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, “If you are returning to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and Ashtoreths among you, prepare your hearts for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and serve Him only. And He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So the Israelites put away the Baals and Ashtoreths and served only <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> on your behalf.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>When they had gathered at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. On that day they fasted, and there they confessed, “We have sinned against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.” And Samuel judged<span class="fn">a</span>  the Israelites at Mizpah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, their rulers marched up toward Israel. And when the Israelites learned of this, they feared the Philistines
<span class="reftext">8</span>and said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God for us, that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. He cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> on behalf of Israel, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> answered him.
<span class="reftext">10</span>As the Philistines drew near to fight against Israel, Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering. But that day <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> thundered loudly against the Philistines and threw them into such confusion that they fled before Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then the men of Israel charged out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, striking them down all the way to an area below Beth-car.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Afterward, Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen.<span class="fn">b</span>  He named it Ebenezer,<span class="fn">c</span>  saying, “Thus far <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has helped us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped invading the territory of Israel. And the hand of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.
<span class="reftext">14</span>The cities from Ekron to Gath, which the Philistines had taken, were restored to Israel, who also delivered the surrounding territory from the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between the Israelites and the Amorites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Every year he would go on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all these places.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Then he would return to Ramah because his home was there, and there he judged Israel and built an altar to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">governed</i> or <i class="calibre6">led</i>; similarly in verses 15, 16, and 17<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew; LXX and Syriac <i class="calibre6">Jeshanah</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Ebenezer</i> means <i class="calibre6">stone of help</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
