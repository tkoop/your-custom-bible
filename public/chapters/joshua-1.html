<span class="reftext">2</span>“Moses <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> servant is dead. Now therefore arise, you and all these people, and cross over the Jordan into the land that I am giving to the children of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>I have given you every place where the sole of your foot will tread, just as I promised to Moses.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Your territory shall extend from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great River Euphrates—all the land of the Hittites—and west as far as the <span class='cap'>Great</span><span class='nocap'>great</span><span class='bsb'>Great</span> <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span><span class='bsb'>Sea</span>.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>No one shall stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Be strong and courageous, for you shall give these people the inheritance of the land that I swore to their fathers I would give them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Above all, be strong and very courageous. Be careful to observe all the law that <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may prosper wherever you go.
<span class="reftext">8</span>This <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span><span class='bsb'>Book</span> of the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span><span class='bsb'>Law</span> must not depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. For then you will prosper and succeed in all you do.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Have I not commanded you to be strong and courageous? Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is with you wherever you go.”
</p><p class="hdg">Joshua Takes Charge</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people:
<span class="reftext">11</span>“Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Prepare <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> provisions, for within three days <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will cross the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God is giving <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to possess.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
<span class="reftext">13</span>“Remember what Moses the servant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> commanded <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> when he said, ‘<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God will give you rest, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> will give <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> this land.’
<span class="reftext">14</span><span class='youpl' data-word='Your'>Your</span> wives, your young children, and <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> livestock may remain in the land that Moses gave <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> on this side of the Jordan. But all <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> mighty men of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span> must be armed for battle to cross over ahead of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers and help them,
<span class="reftext">15</span>until <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gives them rest as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has done for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers also possess the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God is giving them. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may return to the land of your inheritance and take possession of that which Moses the servant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gave <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> on the east side of the Jordan.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So they answered Joshua, “Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. And may <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God be with you, as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was with Moses.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Anyone who rebels against your order and does not obey your words, all that you command him, will be put to death. Above all, be strong and courageous!”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the Mediterranean Sea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Cited in Hebrews 13:5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
