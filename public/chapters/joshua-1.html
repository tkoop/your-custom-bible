<font ><b>Joshua Takes Charge</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now after the death of His servant Moses,
the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying,
“Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore arise, you and all these
people, and cross over the Jordan into the land that I am giving to
the children of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I have given you every place where the
sole of your foot will tread, just as I promised to Moses. Your
territory shall extend from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great
River Euphrates—all the land of the Hittites—and west as far as
the Great Sea. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >No one shall stand against you all the
days of your life. As I was with Moses, so will I be with you; I will
never leave you nor forsake you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Be strong and courageous, for you shall
give these people the inheritance of the land that I swore to their
fathers I would give them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Above all, be strong and very courageous.
Be careful to observe all the law that My servant Moses commanded
you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may
prosper wherever you go. This Book of the Law must not depart from
your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful
to do everything written in it. For then you will prosper and succeed
in all you do. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Have I not commanded you to be strong and
courageous? Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the LORD
your God is with you wherever you go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Joshua commanded the officers of the
people: “Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Prepare your
provisions, for within three days you will cross the Jordan to go in
and take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving you
to possess.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and
the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, “Remember what Moses the
servant of the LORD commanded you when he said, ‘The LORD your God
will give you rest, and He will give you this land.’ Your wives,
your young children, and your livestock may remain in the land that
Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But all your mighty men of
valor must be armed for battle to cross over ahead of your brothers
and help them, until the LORD gives them rest as He has done for you,
and your brothers also possess the land that the LORD your God is
giving them. Then you may return to the land of your inheritance and
take possession of that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you
on the east side of the Jordan.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they answered Joshua, “Everything you
have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go.
Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you. And may
the LORD your God be with you, as He was with Moses. Anyone who
rebels against your order and does not obey your words, all that you
command him, will be put to death. Above all, be strong and
courageous!” </font>
