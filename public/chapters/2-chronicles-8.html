<font ><b>Solomon’s Additional Achievements</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now at the end of the twenty years during
which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own palace,
Solomon rebuilt the cities Hiram had given him and settled Israelites
there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and
captured it. He built Tadmor in the wilderness, in addition to all
the store cities that he had built in Hamath. He rebuilt Upper and
Lower Beth-horon as fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars, as
well as Baalath, all the store cities that belonged to Solomon, and
all the cities for his chariots and horses —whatever he desired to
build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for all the people who remained of the
Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (the people
who were not Israelites)— their descendants who remained in the
land, those whom the Israelites were unable to destroy—Solomon
conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this
day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Solomon did not consign any of the
Israelites to slave labor, because they were his men of war, his
officers and captains, and the commanders of his chariots and
cavalry. They were also the chief officers for King Solomon: 250
supervisors. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up
from the City of David to the palace he had built for her. For he
said, “My wife must not live in the house of David king of Israel,
because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Solomon offered burnt
offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD he had built in front
of the portico. He observed the daily requirement for offerings
according to the commandment of Moses for Sabbaths, New Moons, and
the three annual appointed feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread,
the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In keeping with the ordinances of his
father David, Solomon appointed the divisions of the priests over
their service, and the Levites for their duties to offer praise and
to minister before the priests according to the daily requirement. He
also appointed gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate, for this
had been the command of David, the man of God. They did not turn
aside from the king’s command regarding the priests or the Levites
or any matter concerning the treasuries. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus all the work of Solomon was carried
out, from the day the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD
until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to
Eloth on the coast of Edom. So Hiram sent him ships captained by his
servants, along with crews of experienced sailors. They went with
Solomon’s servants to Ophir and acquired from there 450 talents of
gold, which they delivered to King Solomon. </font>
