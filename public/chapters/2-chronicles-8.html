<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Solomon’s Additional Achievements<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Kings 9:10–28)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now at the end of the twenty years during which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own palace,
<span class="reftext">2</span>Solomon rebuilt the cities Hiram<span class="fn">a</span>  had given him and settled Israelites there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and captured it.
<span class="reftext">4</span>He built Tadmor in the wilderness, in addition to all the store cities that he had built in Hamath.
<span class="reftext">5</span>He rebuilt Upper and Lower Beth-horon as fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars,
<span class="reftext">6</span>as well as Baalath, all the store cities that belonged to Solomon, and all the cities for his chariots and horses<span class="fn">b</span> —whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>As for all the people who remained of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (the people who were not Israelites)—
<span class="reftext">8</span>their descendants who remained in the land, those whom the Israelites were unable to destroy—Solomon conscripted these people to be forced laborers, as they are to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>But Solomon did not consign any of the Israelites to slave labor, because they were his men of war, his officers and captains, and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry.
<span class="reftext">10</span>They were also the chief officers for King Solomon: 250 supervisors.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her. For he said, “My wife must not live in the house of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>At that time Solomon offered burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD he had built in front of the portico.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He observed the daily requirement for offerings according to the commandment of Moses for Sabbaths, New Moons, and the three annual appointed feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread,<span class="fn">c</span>  the Feast of Weeks,<span class="fn">d</span>  and the Feast of Tabernacles.<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>In keeping with the ordinances of his father David, Solomon appointed the divisions of the priests over their service, and the Levites for their duties to offer praise and to minister before the priests according to the daily requirement. He also appointed gatekeepers by their divisions at each gate, for this had been the command of David, the man of God.
<span class="reftext">15</span>They did not turn aside from the king’s command regarding the priests or the Levites or any matter concerning the treasuries.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Thus all the work of Solomon was carried out, from the day the foundation was laid for the house of the LORD until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and to Eloth<span class="fn">f</span>  on the coast of Edom.<span class="fn">g</span> 
<span class="reftext">18</span>So Hiram sent him ships captained by his servants, along with crews of experienced sailors. They went with Solomon’s servants to Ophir and acquired from there 450 talents of gold,<span class="fn">h</span>  which they delivered to King Solomon.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Huram</i>, a variant of <i class="calibre6">Hiram</i>; also in verse 18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">horsemen</i> or <i class="calibre6">charioteers</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, the seven-day period after the Passover during which no leaven may be eaten; see Exodus 12:14–20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> That is, Shavuot, the late spring feast of pilgrimage to Jerusalem; it is also known as <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Harvest</i> (see Exodus 23:16) or <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Pentecost</i> (see Acts 2:1).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, Sukkot, the autumn feast of pilgrimage to Jerusalem; also translated as <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Booths</i> or <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Shelters</i> and originally called <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Ingathering</i> (see Exodus 23:16 and Exodus 34:22).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">Eloth</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Elath</i>; see LXX, 2 Kings 14:22, and 2 Kings 16:6.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> That is, along the shore of the Red Sea in the land of Edom<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">450 talents</i> is approximately 17 tons or 15.4 metric tons of gold.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
