<span class="reftext">13</span>And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom all that is done under <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>. What a heavy burden God has laid upon the sons of men to occupy them!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I have seen all the things that are done under the sun, and have found them all to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>I said to myself, “Behold, I have grown and increased in wisdom beyond all those before me who were over Jerusalem, and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So I set my mind to know wisdom and madness and folly; I learned that this, too, is a pursuit of the wind.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>For with much wisdom comes much sorrow, </p><p class="indent"> and as knowledge grows, grief increases.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Convener</i> or <i class="calibre6">the Preacher</i> or <i class="calibre6">the leader of the assembly</i>; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Qoheleth</i> is rendered as <i class="calibre6">the Teacher</i> throughout Ecclesiastes.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6"><span class='spell ca'>vapour</span><span class='spell gb'>vapour</span><span class='spell us'>vapor</span></i> or <i class="calibre6">breath</i>; the Hebrew words translated in Ecclesiastes as forms of <i class="calibre6">futile</i> or <i class="calibre6">fleeting</i> can also be translated as <i class="calibre6">vanity</i> or <i class="calibre6">meaningless</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
