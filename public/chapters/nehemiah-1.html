<font ><b>Nehemiah’s Prayer</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These are the words of Nehemiah son of
Hacaliah: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the month of Chislev, in the twentieth
year, while I was in the citadel of Susa, Hanani, one of my brothers,
arrived with men from Judah. So I questioned them about the remnant
of the Jews who had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And they told me, “The remnant who
survived the exile are there in the province, in great trouble and
disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are
burned with fire.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When I heard these words, I sat down and
wept. I mourned for days, fasting and praying before the God of
heaven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I said: </font>

“<font >O LORD, God of heaven, the great and
awesome God who keeps His covenant of loving devotion with those who
love Him and keep His commandments, let Your eyes be open and Your
ears attentive to hear the prayer that I, Your servant, now pray
before You day and night for Your servants, the Israelites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I confess the sins that we Israelites have
committed against You. Both I and my father’s house have sinned. We
have behaved corruptly against You and have not kept the
commandments, statutes, and ordinances that You gave Your servant
Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Remember, I pray, the word that You
commanded Your servant Moses when You said, ‘If you are unfaithful,
I will scatter you among the nations, but if you return to Me and
keep and practice My commandments, then even if your exiles have been
banished to the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and
bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for My Name.’ </font>

<font >They are Your servants and Your people.
You redeemed them by Your great power and mighty hand. O Lord, may
Your ear be attentive to my prayer and to the prayers of Your
servants who delight to revere Your name. Give Your servant success
this day, I pray, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.” </font>
