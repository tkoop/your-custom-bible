<span class="reftext">2</span>Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with men from Judah. So I questioned them about the remnant of the Jews who had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And they told me, “The remnant who survived the exile are there in the province, in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When I heard these words, I sat down and wept. I mourned for days, fasting and praying before the God of heaven.
