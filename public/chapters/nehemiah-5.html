<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">About that time there was a great outcry
from the people and their wives against their fellow Jews. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Some were saying, “We and our sons and
daughters are numerous. We must get grain in order to eat and stay
alive.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Others were saying, “We are mortgaging
our fields, our vineyards, and our homes to get grain during the
famine.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Still others were saying, “We have
borrowed money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards.
We and our children are just like our countrymen and their children,
yet we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our
daughters are already enslaved, but we are powerless to redeem them
because our fields and vineyards belong to others.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When I heard their outcry and these
complaints, I became extremely angry, and after serious thought I
rebuked the nobles and officials, saying, “You are exacting usury
from your own brothers!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I called a large assembly against them
and said, “We have done our best to buy back our Jewish brothers
who were sold to foreigners, but now you are selling your own
brothers, that they may be sold back to us!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But they remained silent, for they could
find nothing to say. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I continued, “What you are doing is
not right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the
reproach of our foreign enemies? I, as well as my brothers and my
servants, have been lending the people money and grain. Please, let
us stop this usury. Please restore to them immediately their fields,
vineyards, olive groves, and houses, along with the percentage of the
money, grain, new wine, and oil that you have been assessing them.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">We will restore it,” they replied,
“and will require nothing more from them. We will do as you say.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I summoned the priests and required of
the nobles and officials an oath that they would do what they had
promised. I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, “May God
likewise shake out of His house and possession every man who does not
keep this promise. May such a man be shaken out and have nothing!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The whole assembly said, “Amen,” and
they praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Furthermore, from the day King Artaxerxes
appointed me to be their governor in the land of Judah, from his
twentieth year until his thirty-second year (twelve years total),
neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The governors before me had heavily
burdened the people, taking from them bread and wine plus forty
shekels of silver. Their servants also oppressed the people, but I
did not do this because of my fear of God. Instead, I devoted myself
to the construction of the wall, and all my servants were gathered
there for the work; we did not acquire any land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">There were 150 Jews and officials at my
table, besides the guests from the surrounding nations. Each day one
ox, six choice sheep, and some fowl were prepared for me, and once
every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine was provided. But I
did not demand the food allotted to the governor, because the burden
on the people was so heavy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Remember me favorably, O my God, for all
that I have done for this people. </font>
