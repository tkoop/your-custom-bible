<span class="reftext">2</span>and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And Abijam walked in all the sins that his father before him had committed, and his heart was not as fully devoted to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> his God as the heart of David his forefather had been.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Nevertheless, for the sake of David, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up a son to succeed him and to make Jerusalem strong.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For David had done what was right in the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and had not turned aside from anything <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> commanded all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>And there was war between the houses of Rehoboam<span class="fn">c</span>  and Jeroboam all the days of Abijam’s life.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>As for the rest of the acts of Abijam, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And Abijam rested with his fathers and was buried in the <span class='cap'>City</span><span class='nocap'>city</span> of David, and his son Asa reigned in his place.

<span class="reftext">10</span>and he reigned in Jerusalem forty-one years. His grandmother’s<span class="fn">e</span>  name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And Asa did what was right in the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, as his father David had done.
<span class="reftext">12</span>He banished the male shrine prostitutes from the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He also removed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made a detestable Asherah pole. Asa chopped down the pole and burned it in the Kidron <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The high places were not removed, but Asa’s heart was fully devoted to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> all his days.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And he brought into the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> the silver and gold and other articles that he and his father had dedicated.
</p><p class="hdg">War between Asa and Baasha<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 16:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their days.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Baasha king of Israel went to war against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>So Asa withdrew all the silver and gold that remained in the treasuries of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and the royal palace. He entrusted it to his servants and sent them with this message to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus:
<span class="reftext">19</span>“Let there be a treaty<span class="fn">f</span>  between me and you, between my father and your father. See, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold. Now go and break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and the whole land of Naphtali, including the region of Chinnereth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>When Baasha learned of this, he stopped fortifying Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Then King Asa summoned all the men of Judah,<span class="fn">g</span>  with no exceptions, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had used for building. And with these materials King Asa built up Geba of Benjamin, as well as Mizpah.
</p><p class="hdg">Jehoshaphat Succeeds Asa<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 17:1–19)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Now the rest of the acts of Asa, along with all his might, all his accomplishments, and the cities he built, are they not written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? In his old age, however, he became diseased in his feet.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>And Asa rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of his father David, and his son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place.
</p><p class="hdg">Nadab Reigns in Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>In the second year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel, and he reigned two years.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And he did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and walked in the way of his father and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against Nadab, and Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon of the Philistines while Nadab and all Israel were besieging the city.
<span class="reftext">28</span>In the third year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Baasha killed Nadab and reigned in his place.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>As soon as Baasha became king, he struck down the entire household of Jeroboam.

<span class="reftext">30</span>because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit, and because he had provoked <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, to anger.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>As for the rest of the acts of Nadab, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
