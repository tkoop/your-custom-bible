<font face="Tahoma, serif">These are the commandments and statutes
and ordinances that the LORD your God has instructed me to teach you
to follow in the land that you are about to enter and possess, so
that you and your children and grandchildren may fear the LORD your
God all the days of your lives by keeping all His statutes and
commandments that I give you, and so that your days may be prolonged.
Hear, O Israel, and be careful to observe them, so that you may
prosper and multiply greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey,
just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD
is One. And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and
with all your soul and with all your strength. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">These words I am commanding you today are
to be upon your hearts. And you shall teach them diligently to your
children and speak of them when you sit at home and when you walk
along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as
reminders on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them
on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when the LORD your God brings you into
the land He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that
He would give you—a land with great and splendid cities that you
did not build, with houses full of every good thing with which you
did not fill them, with wells that you did not dig, and with
vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant—and when you eat
and are satisfied, be careful not to forget the LORD who brought you
out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Fear the LORD your God, serve Him only,
and take your oaths in His name. Do not follow other gods, the gods
of the peoples around you. For the LORD your God, who is among you,
is a jealous God. Otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be
kindled against you, and He will wipe you off the face of the earth. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not test the LORD your God as you
tested Him at Massah. You are to diligently keep the commandments of
the LORD your God and the testimonies and statutes He has given you.
Do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, so that it may be
well with you and that you may enter and possess the good land that
the LORD your God swore to give your fathers, driving out all your
enemies before you, as the LORD has said. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the future, when your son asks, “What
is the meaning of the decrees and statutes and ordinances that the
LORD our God has commanded you?” then you are to tell him, “We
were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt
with a mighty hand. Before our eyes the LORD inflicted great and
devastating signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his
household. But He brought us out from there to lead us in and give us
the land that He had sworn to our fathers. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD commanded us to observe all
these statutes and to fear the LORD our God, that we may always be
prosperous and preserved, as we are to this day. And if we are
careful to observe every one of these commandments before the LORD
our God, as He has commanded us, then that will be our
righteousness.” </font>
