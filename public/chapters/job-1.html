And this man was blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil.
<span class="reftext">2</span>He had seven sons and three daughters,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and he owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man of all the people of the East.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Job’s sons would take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And when the days of feasting were over, Job would send for his children to purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for all of them. For Job thought, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice.
</p><p class="hdg">Satan’s First Attack</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>One day the sons of God came to present themselves before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and Satan<span class="fn">a</span>  also came with them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>“Where have you come from?” said <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to Satan. </p><p class="reg1">“From roaming through the earth,” he replied, “and walking back and forth in it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Satan, “Have you considered <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> servant Job? For there is no one on <span class='nocap'>Earth</span><span class='cap'>Earth</span><span class='bsb'>earth</span> like him, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Satan answered <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “Does Job fear God for nothing?
<span class="reftext">10</span>Have <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> not placed a hedge on every side around him and his household and all that he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
<span class="reftext">11</span>But stretch out <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> hand and strike all that he has, and he will surely curse <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> to <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> face.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“Very well,” said <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to Satan. “Everything he has is in your hands, but you must not lay a hand on the man himself.” </p><p class="reg1"> Then Satan went out from the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="hdg">Job Loses His Children and Possessions</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>One day, while Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
<span class="reftext">14</span>a messenger came and reported to Job: “While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
<span class="reftext">15</span>the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They put the servants to the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: “The fire of God fell from <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>. It burned and consumed the sheep and the servants, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: “The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels, and took them away. They put the servants to the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
<span class="reftext">19</span>when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshiped,
<span class="reftext">21</span>saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Naked I came from my mother’s womb, </p><p class="indent"> and naked I will return. </p><p class="indent1"> <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> gave, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has taken away. </p><p class="indent"> Blessed be the name of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>In all this, Job did not sin or charge God with wrongdoing.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, <i class="calibre6">the Accuser</i> or <i class="calibre6">the Adversary</i>; here and throughout Job 1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
