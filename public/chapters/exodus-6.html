appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by
My name the LORD I did not make Myself known to them. I also

the land where they lived as foreigners. Furthermore, I have heard
the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and
I have remembered My covenant. </font>

LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians
and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an
outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment. I will take you as
My own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am
the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the
Egyptians. And I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I
am the LORD!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
