<font >In the tenth year, on the twelfth day of
the tenth month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Son of
man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against
him and against all Egypt. Speak to him and tell him that this is

<font >Because you said, ‘The Nile is mine; I

will turn the land of Egypt into a ruin, a desolate wasteland from
Migdol to Syene, and as far as the border of Cush. No foot of man or
beast will pass through, and it will be uninhabited for forty years. </font>

<font >I will make the land of Egypt a desolation

<font >For this is what the Lord GOD says: At the
end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations to
which they were scattered. I will restore Egypt from captivity and
bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin.
There they will be a lowly kingdom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Egypt will be the lowliest of kingdoms and
will never again exalt itself above the nations. For I will diminish
Egypt so that it will never again rule over the nations. Egypt will
never again be an object of trust for the house of Israel, but will
remind them of their iniquity in turning to the Egyptians. Then they
will know that I am the Lord GOD.” </font>

<font >In the twenty-seventh year, on the first
day of the first month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Son
of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to labor

made raw. But he and his army received no wages from Tyre for the
labor they expended on it. </font>

<font >Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who
will carry off its wealth, seize its spoil, and remove its plunder.
This will be the wages for his army. I have given him the land of
Egypt as the reward for his labor, because it was done for Me,
declares the Lord GOD. </font>

for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth to speak among
them. Then they will know that I am the LORD.” </font>
