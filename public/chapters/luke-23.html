<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jesus before Pilate<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 27:11–14; John 18:28–40)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the whole council rose and led Jesus away to Pilate.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And they began to accuse <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar, and proclaiming <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> to be Christ, a King.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So Pilate asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> the King of the Jews?” </p><p class="reg1"><span>“You have said so,”</span> Jesus replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people all over Judea with <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> teaching. He began in Galilee and has come all the way here.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus before Herod</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And learning that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> to Herod, who himself was in Jerusalem at that time.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased. He had wanted to see <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> for a long time, because he had heard about <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and was hoping to see <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> perform a miracle.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Herod questioned Jesus at great length, but <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> gave no answer.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Meanwhile, the chief priests and scribes stood there, vehemently accusing <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And even Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. Dressing <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in a fine robe, they sent <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> back to Pilate.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>That day Herod and Pilate became friends; before this time they had been enemies.
</p><p class="hdg">The Crowd Chooses Barabbas<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 27:15–23; Mark 15:6–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,
<span class="reftext">14</span>and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> here in your presence and found <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> not guilty of your charges against <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Neither has Herod, for he sent <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> back to us. As you can see, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has done nothing deserving of death.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore I will punish <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and release <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.”<span class="fn">a</span> 

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>But they all cried out in unison: “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!”
<span class="reftext">19</span>(Barabbas had been imprisoned for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed them again,
<span class="reftext">21</span>but they kept shouting, “Crucify <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>! Crucify <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>A third time he said to them, “What evil has this man done? I have found in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> no <span class='spell ca'>offence</span><span class='spell gb'>offence</span><span class='spell us'>offense</span> worthy of death. So after I punish <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, I will release <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices for Jesus to be crucified. And their <span class='spell ca'>clamour</span><span class='spell gb'>clamour</span><span class='spell us'>clamor</span><span class="fn">b</span>  prevailed.
<span class="reftext">24</span>So Pilate sentenced that their demand be met.
<span class="reftext">25</span>As they had requested, he released the one imprisoned for insurrection and murder, and handed Jesus over to their will.
</p><p class="hdg">The Crucifixion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 22:1–31; Matthew 27:32–44; Mark 15:21–32; John 19:16–27)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>As the soldiers led <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> away, they seized Simon of Cyrene on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>A great number of people followed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, including women who kept mourning and wailing for <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">28</span>But Jesus turned to them and said, <span>“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Look, the days are coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore, and breasts that never nursed!’
<span class="reftext">30</span>At that time </span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘they will say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” </p><p class="indentred"> and to the hills, “Cover us!”<span class="thinq"> </span>’<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>For if men do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>When they came to the place called <span class='cap'>The</span><span class='nocap'>the</span> <span class='cap'>Skull</span><span class='nocap'>skull</span>,<span class="fn">d</span>  they crucified <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> there, along with the criminals, one on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> right and the other on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> left.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Then Jesus said, <span>“Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”</span><span class="fn">e</span>  And they divided up <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> garments by casting lots.<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>The people stood watching, and the rulers sneered at <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>,<span class="fn">g</span>  saying, “He saved others; let <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> save <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> if <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is the Christ of God, the <span class='cap'>Chosen</span><span class='nocap'>chosen</span> <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>The soldiers also mocked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and came up to offer <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> sour wine.<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">37</span>“If <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> are the King of the Jews,” they said, “save <span class='cap'>Yourself</span><span class='nocap'>yourself</span>!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>Above <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> was posted an inscription:<span class="fn">i</span>  </p><p class="reg1"></p><div class="inscrip1"> THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</div>
<p class="calibre3"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>One of the criminals who hung there heaped abuse on <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. “Are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> not the Christ?” he said. “Save <span class='cap'>Yourself</span><span class='nocap'>yourself</span> and us!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span>?
<span class="reftext">41</span>We are punished justly, for we are receiving what our actions deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”
<span class="reftext">42</span>Then he said, “Jesus, remember me<span class="fn">j</span>  when <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> come into <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> kingdom!”
