<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Warning to Judah’s Kings</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and proclaim this message there,
<span class="reftext">2</span>saying, ‘Hear the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, O king of Judah, who sits on the throne of David—you and your officials and your people who enter these gates.
<span class="reftext">3</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: Administer justice and righteousness. Rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of his oppressor. Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless, or the widow. Do not shed innocent blood in this place.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>For if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will indeed carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David’s throne will enter through the gates of this palace riding on chariots and horses—they and their officials and their people.
<span class="reftext">5</span>But if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not obey these words, then I swear by <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span>, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, that this house will become a pile of rubble.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">A Warning about the Palace</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says concerning the house of the king of Judah: </p><p class="indent1stline"> “You are like Gilead to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, </p><p class="indent"> like the summit of Lebanon; </p><p class="indent1"> but I will surely turn you into a desert, </p><p class="indent"> like cities that are uninhabited.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>I will appoint destroyers against you, </p><p class="indent"> each man with his weapons, </p><p class="indent1"> and they will cut down the choicest of your cedars </p><p class="indent"> and throw them into the fire.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And many nations will pass by this city and ask one another, ‘Why has <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> done such a thing to this great city?’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then people will reply, ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> their God and have worshiped and served other gods.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">A Warning about Shallum</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Do not weep for the dead king; </p><p class="indent"> do not mourn his loss. </p><p class="indent1"> Weep bitterly for the one who is exiled, </p><p class="indent"> for he will never return </p><p class="indent"> to see his native land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says concerning Shallum<span class="fn">a</span>  son of Josiah, king of Judah, who succeeded his father Josiah but has gone forth from this place: “He will never return,
<span class="reftext">12</span>but he will die in the place to which he was exiled; he will never see this land again.”
</p><p class="hdg">A Warning about Jehoiakim</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>“Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness, </p><p class="indent"> and his upper rooms without justice, </p><p class="indent1"> who makes his countrymen serve without pay, </p><p class="indent"> and fails to pay their wages,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>who says, ‘I will build myself a great palace, </p><p class="indent"> with spacious upper rooms.’ </p><p class="indent1"> So he cuts windows in it, </p><p class="indent"> panels it with cedar, </p><p class="indent"> and paints it with vermilion.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>Does it make you a king to excel<span class="fn">b</span>  in cedar? </p><p class="indent"> Did not your father have food and drink? </p><p class="indent1"> He administered justice and righteousness, </p><p class="indent"> and so it went well with him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>He took up the cause of the poor and needy, </p><p class="indent"> and so it went well with him. </p><p class="indent1"> Is this not what it means to know <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>?” </p><p class="indent"> declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>“But your eyes and heart are set on nothing </p><p class="indent"> except your own dishonest gain, </p><p class="indent1"> on shedding innocent blood, </p><p class="indent"> on <span class='spell ca'>practising</span><span class='spell gb'>practising</span><span class='spell us'>practicing</span> extortion and oppression.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: </p><p class="indent1stline">“They will not mourn for him: </p><p class="indent">‘Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!’ </p><p class="indent1"> They will not mourn for him: </p><p class="indent">‘Alas, my master! Alas, his <span class='spell ca'>splendour</span><span class='spell gb'>splendour</span><span class='spell us'>splendor</span>!’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>He will be buried like a donkey, </p><p class="indent"> dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Go up to Lebanon and cry out; </p><p class="indent"> raise your voice in Bashan; </p><p class="indent1"> cry out from Abarim, </p><p class="indent"> for all your lovers have been crushed.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>I warned you when you were secure. </p><p class="indent"> You said, ‘I will not listen.’ </p><p class="indent1"> This has been your way from youth, </p><p class="indent"> that you have not obeyed <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> voice.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>The wind will drive away all your shepherds, </p><p class="indent"> and your lovers will go into captivity. </p><p class="indent1"> Then you will be ashamed and humiliated </p><p class="indent"> because of all your wickedness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>O inhabitant of Lebanon,<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent"> nestled in the cedars, </p><p class="indent1"> how you will groan when pangs of anguish come upon you, </p><p class="indent"> agony like a woman in <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>.”
</p><p class="hdg">A Warning to Coniah</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>“As surely as I live,” declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “even if you, Coniah<span class="fn">d</span>  son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> right hand, I would pull you off.
<span class="reftext">25</span>In fact, I will hand you over to those you dread, who want to take your life—to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to the Chaldeans.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">26</span>I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another land, where neither of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were born—and there <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> both will die.
