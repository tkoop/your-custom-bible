<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Samuel died, all Israel gathered to
mourn for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David set out and went down to the
Wilderness of Paran. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now there was a man in Maon whose business
was in Carmel. He was a very wealthy man with a thousand goats and
three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. His name was
Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and
beautiful woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was harsh and evil in
his dealings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While David was in the wilderness, he
heard that Nabal was shearing sheep. So David sent ten young men and
instructed them, “Go up to Nabal at Carmel. Greet him in my name
and say to him, ‘Long life to you, and peace to you and your house
and to all that belongs to you. Now I hear that it is time for
shearing. When your shepherds were with us, we did not harass them,
and nothing of theirs was missing the whole time they were in Carmel.
Ask your young men, and they will tell you. So let my young men find
favor with you, for we have come on the day of a feast. Please give
whatever you can afford to your servants and to your son David.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When David’s young men arrived, they
relayed all these words to Nabal on behalf of David. Then they
waited. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Nabal asked them, “Who is David? Who
is this son of Jesse? Many servants these days are breaking away from
their masters. Why should I take my bread and water and the meat I
have slaughtered for my shearers, and give them to these men whose
origin I do not know?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David’s men turned around and went
back, and they relayed to him all these words. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And David said to his men, “Strap on
your swords!” So David and all his men put on their swords, and
about four hundred men followed David, while two hundred stayed with
the supplies. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile, one of Nabal’s young men
informed Nabal’s wife Abigail, “Look, David sent messengers from
the wilderness to greet our master, but he scolded them. Yet these
men were very good to us. When we were in the field, we were not
harassed, and nothing of ours went missing the whole time we lived
among them. They were a wall around us, both day and night, the whole
time we were herding our sheep near them. Now consider carefully what
you must do, because disaster looms over our master and all his
household. For he is such a scoundrel that nobody can speak to him!”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred
loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five butchered sheep, five seahs
of roasted grain, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred
cakes of figs. She loaded them on donkeys and said to her young men,
“Go ahead of me. I will be right behind you.” But she did not
tell her husband Nabal. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As Abigail came riding her donkey into a
mountain ravine, she saw David and his men coming down toward her,
and she met them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now David had just finished saying, “In
vain I have protected all that belonged to this man in the
wilderness. Nothing that belongs to him has gone missing, yet he has
paid me back evil for good. May God punish David, and ever so
severely, if I let one of Nabal’s men survive until morning.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Abigail saw David, she quickly got
off the donkey, fell facedown, and bowed before him. She fell at his
feet and said, “My lord, may the blame be on me alone, but please
let your servant speak to you; hear the words of your servant. My
lord should pay no attention to this scoundrel Nabal, for he lives up
to his name: His name means Fool, and folly accompanies him. I, your
servant, did not see my lord’s young men whom you sent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now, my lord, as surely as the LORD lives
and you yourself live, the LORD has held you back from coming to
bloodshed and avenging yourself with your own hand. May your enemies
and those who seek harm for my lord be like Nabal. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now let this gift your servant has brought
to my lord be given to the young men who follow you. Please forgive
your servant’s offense, for the LORD will surely make a lasting
dynasty for my lord, because he fights the LORD’s battles. May no
evil be found in you as long as you live. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And should someone pursue you and seek
your life, then the life of my lord will be bound securely by the
LORD your God in the bundle of the living. But He shall fling away
the lives of your enemies like stones from a sling. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the LORD has done for my lord all the
good He promised, and when He has appointed you ruler over Israel,
then my lord will have no remorse or guilt of conscience over
needless bloodshed and revenge. And when the LORD has dealt well with
my lord, may you remember your maidservant.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be
the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you to meet me this day!
Blessed is your discernment, and blessed are you, because today you
kept me from bloodshed and from avenging myself by my own hand.
Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has
restrained me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet
me, then surely no male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive
by morning light.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David accepted from her hand what she
had brought him, and he said to her, “Go home in peace. See, I have
heeded your voice and granted your request.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Abigail returned to Nabal, there he
was in the house, holding a feast fit for a king, in high spirits and
very drunk. So she told him nothing until morning light. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the morning when Nabal was sober, his
wife told him about these events, and his heart failed within him and
he became like a stone. About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal
dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On hearing that Nabal was dead, David
said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has upheld my cause against the
reproach of Nabal and has restrained His servant from evil. For the
LORD has brought the wickedness of Nabal down upon his own head.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David sent word to Abigail, asking
for her in marriage. When his servants came to Abigail at Carmel,
they said, “David has sent us to take you as his wife.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">She arose, then bowed facedown and said,
“Here is your maidservant, ready to serve and to wash the feet of
my lord’s servants.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Abigail hurried and got on a donkey,
and attended by five of her maidens, she followed David’s
messengers and became his wife. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel.
So she and Abigail were both his wives. But Saul had given his
daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from
Gallim. </font>
