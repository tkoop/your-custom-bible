</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>I urge Euodia and Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord.

<span class="reftext">7</span>And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hearts and <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> minds in Christ Jesus.

<span class="reftext">11</span>I am not saying this out of need, for I have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances.
<span class="reftext">12</span>I know how to live humbly, and I know how to abound. I am accustomed to any and every situation—to being filled and being hungry, to having plenty and having need.
<span class="reftext">13</span>I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Nevertheless, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have done well to share in my affliction.

<span class="reftext">16</span>For even while I was in Thessalonica, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> provided for my needs again and again.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Not that I am seeking a gift, but I am looking for the fruit that may be credited to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> account.
<span class="reftext">18</span>I have all I need and more, now that I have received <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> gifts from Epaphroditus. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And my God will supply all <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> needs according to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> glorious riches in Christ Jesus.
