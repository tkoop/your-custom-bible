4</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font ><b>Rejoice in the Lord</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and
long for, my joy and crown, that is how you must stand firm in the
Lord, my beloved. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I urge Euodia and Syntyche to agree with
each other in the Lord. Yes, and I ask you, my true yokefellow, to
help these women who have labored with me for the gospel, along with
Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the
Book of Life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it
again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be apparent to all. The Lord is
near. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Be anxious for nothing, but in everything,
by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to
God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will
guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Finally, brothers, whatever is true,
whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever
is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or
praiseworthy—think on these things. Whatever you have learned or
received or heard from me, or seen in me, put it into practice. And
the God of peace will be with you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at
last you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned,
but you had no opportunity to show it. I am not saying this out of
need, for I have learned to be content regardless of my
circumstances. I know how to live humbly, and I know how to abound. I
am accustomed to any and every situation—to being filled and being
hungry, to having plenty and having need. I can do all things through
Christ who gives me strength. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, you have done well to share
in my affliction. And as you Philippians know, in the early days of
the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church but you partnered with
me in the matter of giving and receiving. For even while I was in
Thessalonica, you provided for my needs again and again. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Not that I am seeking a gift, but I am
looking for the fruit that may be credited to your account. I have
all I need and more, now that I have received your gifts from
Epaphroditus. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice,
well-pleasing to God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And my God will supply all your needs
according to His glorious riches in Christ Jesus. To our God and
Father be glory forever and ever. Amen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Greet all the saints in Christ Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The brothers who are with me send you
greetings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All the saints send you greetings,
especially those from the household of Caesar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with
your spirit. </font>
