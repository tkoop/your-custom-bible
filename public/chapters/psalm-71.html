</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>In Your justice, rescue and deliver me; </p><p class="indent"> incline Your ear and save me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Be my rock of refuge, </p><p class="indent"> where I can always go. </p><p class="indent1"> Give the command to save me, </p><p class="indent"> for You are my rock and my fortress.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, </p><p class="indent"> from the grasp of the unjust and ruthless.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>For You are my hope, O Lord GOD, </p><p class="indent"> my confidence from my youth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>I have leaned on You since birth; </p><p class="indent"> You pulled me from my mother’s womb. </p><p class="indent"> My praise is always for You.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>I have become a portent to many, </p><p class="indent"> but You are my strong refuge.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>My mouth is filled with Your praise </p><p class="indent"> and with Your splendour all day long.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Do not discard me in my old age; </p><p class="indent"> do not forsake me when my strength fails.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>For my enemies speak against me, </p><p class="indent"> and those who lie in wait for my life conspire,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>saying, “God has forsaken him; </p><p class="indent"> pursue him and seize him, </p><p class="indent"> for there is no one to rescue him.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>Be not far from me, O God. </p><p class="indent"> Hurry, O my God, to help me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>May the accusers of my soul </p><p class="indent"> be ashamed and consumed; </p><p class="indent1"> may those who seek my harm </p><p class="indent"> be covered with scorn and disgrace.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>But I will always hope </p><p class="indent"> and will praise You more and more.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>My mouth will declare Your righteousness </p><p class="indent"> and Your salvation all day long, </p><p class="indent"> though I cannot know their full measure.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>I will enter in the strength of the Lord GOD; </p><p class="indent"> I will proclaim Your righteousness—Yours alone.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>O God, You have taught me from my youth, </p><p class="indent"> and to this day I proclaim Your marvellous deeds.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Even when I am old and grey, </p><p class="indent"> do not forsake me, O God, </p><p class="indent1"> until I proclaim Your power to the next generation, </p><p class="indent"> Your might to all who are to come.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Your righteousness reaches to the heavens, O God, </p><p class="indent"> You who have done great things. </p><p class="indent"> Who, O God, is like You?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Though You have shown me many troubles and misfortunes, </p><p class="indent"> You will revive me once again. </p><p class="indent1"> Even from the depths of the earth </p><p class="indent"> You will bring me back up.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>You will increase my honour </p><p class="indent"> and comfort me once again.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>So I will praise You with the harp </p><p class="indent"> for Your faithfulness, O my God; </p><p class="indent1"> I will sing praise to You with the lyre, </p><p class="indent"> O Holy One of Israel.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When I sing praise to You </p><p class="indent"> my lips will shout for joy, </p><p class="indent1"> along with my soul, </p><p class="indent">which You have redeemed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>My tongue will indeed proclaim </p><p class="indent"> Your righteousness all day long, </p><p class="indent1"> for those who seek my harm </p><p class="indent"> are disgraced and confounded.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
