<font ><b>Kings of the South and North</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >And I, in the first year of Darius the
Mede, stood up to strengthen and protect him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now then, I will tell you the truth: Three
more kings will arise in Persia, and then a fourth, who will be far
richer than all the others. By the power of his wealth, he will stir
up everyone against the kingdom of Greece. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a mighty king will arise, who will
rule with great authority and do as he pleases. But as soon as he is
established, his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward
the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will
it have the authority with which he ruled, because his kingdom will
be uprooted and given to others. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The king of the South will grow strong,
but one of his commanders will grow even stronger and will rule his
own kingdom with great authority. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After some years they will form an
alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will go to the
king of the North to seal the agreement. But his daughter will not
retain her position of power, nor will his strength endure. At that
time she will be given up, along with her royal escort and her father
and the one who supported her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But one from her family line will rise up
in his place, come against the army of the king of the North, and
enter his fortress, fighting and prevailing. He will take even their
gods captive to Egypt, with their metal images and their precious
vessels of silver and gold. For some years he will stay away from the
king of the North, who will invade the realm of the king of the South
and then return to his own land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But his sons will stir up strife and
assemble a great army, which will advance forcefully, sweeping
through like a flood, and will again carry the battle as far as his
fortress. In a rage, the king of the South will march out to fight
the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but it will be
delivered into the hand of his enemy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the army is carried off, the king of
the South will be proud in heart and will cast down tens of
thousands, but he will not triumph. For the king of the North will
raise another army, larger than the first, and after some years he
will advance with a great army and many supplies. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In those times many will rise up against
the king of the South. Violent ones among your own people will exalt
themselves in fulfillment of the vision, but they will fail. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king of the North will come,
build up a siege ramp, and capture a fortified city. The forces of
the South will not stand; even their best troops will not be able to
resist. The invader will do as he pleases, and no one will stand
against him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land, with
destruction in his hand. He will resolve to come with the strength of
his whole kingdom, and will reach an agreement with the king of the
South. He will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow
the kingdom, but his plan will not succeed or help him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he will turn his face to the
coastlands and capture many of them. But a commander will put an end
to his reproach and will turn it back upon him. After this, he will
turn back toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble
and fall and be no more. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In his place one will arise who will send
out a tax collector for the glory of the kingdom; but within a few
days he will be destroyed, though not in anger or in battle. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In his place a despicable person will
arise; royal honors will not be given to him, but he will come in a
time of peace and seize the kingdom by intrigue. Then a flood of
forces will be swept away before him and destroyed, along with a
prince of the covenant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After an alliance is made with him, he
will act deceitfully; for he will rise to power with only a few
people. In a time of peace, he will invade the richest provinces and
do what his fathers and forefathers never did. He will lavish
plunder, loot, and wealth on his followers, and he will plot against
the strongholds—but only for a time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And with a large army he will stir up his
power and his courage against the king of the South, who will
mobilize a very large and powerful army but will not withstand the
plots devised against him. Those who eat from his provisions will
seek to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall
slain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the two kings, with their hearts bent
on evil, will speak lies at the same table, but to no avail, for
still the end will come at the appointed time. The king of the North
will return to his land with great wealth, but his heart will be set
against the holy covenant; so he will do damage and return to his own
land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At the appointed time he will invade the
South again, but this time will not be like the first. Ships of
Kittim will come against him, and he will lose heart. Then he will
turn back and rage against the holy covenant and do damage. So he
will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.
His forces will rise up and desecrate the temple fortress. They will
abolish the daily sacrifice and set up the abomination of desolation.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >With flattery he will corrupt those who
violate the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly
resist him. Those with insight will instruct many, though for a time
they will fall by sword or flame, or be captured or plundered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now when they fall, they will be granted a
little help, but many will join them insincerely. Some of the wise
will fall, so that they may be refined, purified, and made spotless
until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed
time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king will do as he pleases and
will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and he will speak
monstrous things against the God of gods. He will be successful until
the time of wrath is completed, for what has been decreed must be
accomplished. He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers, nor
for the one desired by women, nor for any other god, because he will
magnify himself above them all. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And in their place, he will honor a god of
fortresses—a god his fathers did not know—with gold, silver,
precious stones, and riches. He will attack the strongest fortresses
with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who
acknowledge him, making them rulers over many and distributing the
land for a price. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At the time of the end, the king of the
South will engage him in battle, but the king of the North will storm
out against him with chariots, horsemen, and many ships, invading
many countries and sweeping through them like a flood. He will also
invade the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall. But these
will be delivered from his hand: Edom, Moab, and the leaders of the
Ammonites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He will extend his power over many
countries, and not even the land of Egypt will escape. He will gain
control of the treasures of gold and silver and over all the riches
of Egypt, and the Libyans and Cushites will also submit to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But news from the east and the north will
alarm him, and he will go out with great fury to destroy many and
devote them to destruction. He will pitch his royal tents between the
sea and the beautiful holy mountain, but he will meet his end with no
one to help him. </font>
