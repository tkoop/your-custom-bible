<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Temple Rebuilding Resumes<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Haggai 1:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Later, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak<span class="fn">a</span>  rose up and began to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them, helping them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>At that time Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates,<span class="fn">b</span>  Shethar-bozenai, and their associates went to the Jews and asked, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>They also asked,<span class="fn">c</span>  “What are the names of the men who are constructing this building?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, so that they were not stopped until a report was sent to Darius and written instructions about this matter were returned.
</p><p class="hdg">Tattenai’s Letter to Darius</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>This is the text of the letter that Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates, the officials in the region, sent to King Darius.
<span class="reftext">7</span>The report they sent him read as follows: </p><p class="tab1stline"> To King Darius: </p><p class="tab1stline"> All peace.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Let it be known to the king that we went into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. The people are rebuilding it with large stones, and placing timbers in the walls. This work is being carried out diligently and is prospering in their hands.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>So we questioned the elders and asked, “Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?”
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>We also asked for their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders<span class="fn">d</span>  for your information.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>And this is the answer they returned: </p><p class="tab1stline">“We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But since our fathers angered the God of heaven, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> delivered them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean who destroyed this temple and carried away the people to Babylon.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>In his first year, however, Cyrus king of Babylon issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
<span class="reftext">14</span>He also removed from the temple<span class="fn">e</span>  of Babylon the gold and silver articles belonging to the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken and carried there from the temple in Jerusalem. King Cyrus gave these articles to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor
<span class="reftext">15</span>and instructed, ‘Take these articles, put them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its original site.’
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem, and from that time until now it has been under construction, but it has not yet been completed.”
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>Now, therefore, if it pleases the king, let a search be made of the royal archives in Babylon to see if King Cyrus did indeed issue a decree to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Jozadak</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jehozadak</i>; see 1 Chronicles 6:14.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Aramaic <i class="calibre6">the governor beyond the River</i>; also in verse 6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> LXX and Syriac; Aramaic <i class="calibre6">Then we told them,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Aramaic <i class="calibre6">the names of the men at their heads</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">palace</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
