<font >Later, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah
son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name
of the God of Israel, who was over them. Then Zerubbabel son of
Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak rose up and began to rebuild the
house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them,
helping them. </font>

<font >At that time Tattenai the governor of the

<font >Let it be known to the king that we went
into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. The people
are rebuilding it with large stones, and placing timbers in the

“<font >We are servants of the God of heaven
and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years
ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed. But since our
fathers angered the God of heaven, He delivered them into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean who destroyed this
temple and carried away the people to Babylon. </font>

<font >In his first year, however, Cyrus king of
Babylon issued a decree to rebuild this house of God. He also removed
from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles belonging to
the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken and carried there
from the temple in Jerusalem. King Cyrus gave these articles to a man
named Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor and instructed, ‘Take
these articles, put them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the
house of God be rebuilt on its original site.’ </font>

let a search be made of the royal archives in Babylon to see if King
Cyrus did indeed issue a decree to rebuild the house of God in
Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter. </font>
