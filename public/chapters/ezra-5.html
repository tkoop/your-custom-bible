<font ><b>Tattenai’s Letter to Darius</b></font></p>

<font >Later, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah
son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name
of the God of Israel, who was over them. Then Zerubbabel son of
Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak rose up and began to rebuild the
house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them,
helping them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Tattenai the governor of the
region west of the Euphrates, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates
went to the Jews and asked, “Who authorized you to rebuild this
temple and restore this structure?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They also asked, “What are the names of
the men who are constructing this building?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the eye of their God was on the elders
of the Jews, so that they were not stopped until a report was sent to
Darius and written instructions about this matter were returned. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the text of the letter that
Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates,
Shethar-bozenai, and their associates, the officials in the region,
sent to King Darius. The report they sent him read as follows: </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All peace. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Let it be known to the king that we went
into the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. The people
are rebuilding it with large stones, and placing timbers in the
walls. This work is being carried out diligently and is prospering in
their hands. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So we questioned the elders and asked,
“Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this
structure?” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We also asked for their names, so that we
could write down the names of their leaders for your information. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And this is the answer they returned: </font>

“<font >We are servants of the God of heaven
and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years
ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed. But since our
fathers angered the God of heaven, He delivered them into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean who destroyed this
temple and carried away the people to Babylon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In his first year, however, Cyrus king of
Babylon issued a decree to rebuild this house of God. He also removed
from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles belonging to
the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken and carried there
from the temple in Jerusalem. King Cyrus gave these articles to a man
named Sheshbazzar, whom he appointed governor and instructed, ‘Take
these articles, put them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the
house of God be rebuilt on its original site.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the
foundation of the house of God in Jerusalem, and from that time until
now it has been under construction, but it has not yet been
completed.” </font>

<font >Now, therefore, if it pleases the king,
let a search be made of the royal archives in Babylon to see if King
Cyrus did indeed issue a decree to rebuild the house of God in
Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter. </font>
