<font ><b>A Prophecy against Zedekiah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the word that came to Jeremiah
from the LORD when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, all his army, all
the earthly kingdoms under his control, and all the other nations
were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding cities. The
LORD, the God of Israel, told Jeremiah to go and speak to Zedekiah
king of Judah and tell him that this is what the LORD says: “Behold,
I am about to deliver this city into the hand of the king of Babylon,
and he will burn it down. And you yourself will not escape his grasp,
but will surely be captured and delivered into his hand. You will see
the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face; and
you will go to Babylon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah
king of Judah. This is what the LORD says concerning you: You will
not die by the sword; you will die in peace. As spices were burned
for your fathers, the former kings who preceded you, so people will
burn spices for you and lament, ‘Alas, O master!’ For I Myself
have spoken this word, declares the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In Jerusalem, then, Jeremiah the prophet
relayed all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah as the army of the
king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the remaining
cities of Judah—against Lachish and Azekah. For these were the only
fortified cities remaining in Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After King Zedekiah had made a covenant
with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim liberty, the word came
to Jeremiah from the LORD that each man should free his Hebrew
slaves, both male and female, and no one should hold his fellow Jew
in bondage. So all the officials and all the people who entered into
this covenant agreed that they would free their menservants and
maidservants and no longer hold them in bondage. They obeyed and
released them, but later they changed their minds and took back the
menservants and maidservants they had freed, and they forced them to
become slaves again. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah
from the LORD, saying, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel,
says: I made a covenant with your forefathers when I brought them out
of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying: Every
seventh year, each of you must free his Hebrew brother who has sold
himself to you. He may serve you six years, but then you must let him
go free. But your fathers did not listen or incline their ear. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Recently you repented and did what pleased
Me; each of you proclaimed freedom for his neighbor. You made a
covenant before Me in the house that bears My Name. But now you have
changed your minds and profaned My name. Each of you has taken back
the menservants and maidservants whom you had set at liberty to go
wherever they wanted, and you have again forced them to be your
slaves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore this is what the LORD says: You
have not obeyed Me; you have not proclaimed freedom, each man for his
brother and for his neighbor. So now I proclaim freedom for you,
declares the LORD—freedom to fall by sword, by plague, and by
famine! I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And those who have transgressed My
covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made
before Me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two in order to
pass between its pieces. The officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the
court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who
passed between the pieces of the calf, I will deliver into the hands
of their enemies who seek their lives. Their corpses will become food
for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth. And I will
deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials into the hands of
their enemies who seek their lives, to the army of the king of
Babylon that had withdrawn from you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Behold, I am going to give the command,
declares the LORD, and I will bring them back to this city. They will
fight against it, capture it, and burn it down. And I will make the
cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.” </font>
