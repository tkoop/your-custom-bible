<font ><b>Elijah’s Letter to Jehoram</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers
and was buried with them in the City of David. And his son Jehoram
reigned in his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoram’s brothers, the sons of
Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and
Shephatiah; these were all sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. Their
father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and precious
things, as well as the fortified cities in Judah; but he gave the
kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jehoram had established himself over
his father’s kingdom, he strengthened himself by putting to the
sword all his brothers along with some of the princes of Israel.
Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem eight years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehoram walked in the ways of the
kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done. For he married a
daughter of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD. Yet the LORD
was unwilling to destroy the house of David, because of the covenant
He had made with David, and since He had promised to maintain a lamp
for David and his descendants forever. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the days of Jehoram, Edom rebelled
against the hand of Judah and appointed their own king. So Jehoram
crossed into Edom with his officers and all his chariots. When the
Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, he rose up and
attacked by night. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So to this day Edom has been in rebellion
against the hand of Judah. Likewise, Libnah rebelled against his rule
at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the LORD, the God of
his fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoram had also built high places on the
hills of Judah; he had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute
themselves and had led Judah astray. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a letter came to Jehoram from Elijah
the prophet, which stated: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >This is what the LORD, the God of your
father David, says: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
‘<font >You have not walked in the ways of your
father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah, but you have walked in
the ways of the kings of Israel and have caused Judah and the people
of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab
prostituted itself. You have also killed your brothers, your father’s
family, who were better than you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So behold, the LORD is about to strike
your people, your sons, your wives, and all your possessions with a
serious blow. And day after day you yourself will suffer from a
severe illness, a disease of your bowels, until it causes your bowels
to come out.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD stirred against Jehoram the
spirit of the Philistines and Arabs who lived near the Cushites. So
they went to war against Judah, invaded it, and carried off all the
possessions found in the king’s palace, along with his sons and
wives; not a son was left to him except Jehoahaz, his youngest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After all this, the LORD afflicted Jehoram
with an incurable disease of the bowels. This continued day after day
until two full years had passed. Finally, his intestines came out
because of his disease, and he died in severe pain. And his people
did not make a fire in his honor as they had done for his fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He died, to no
one’s regret, and was buried in the City of David, but not in the
tombs of the kings. </font>
