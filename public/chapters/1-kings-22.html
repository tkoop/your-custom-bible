<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king of Israel assembled the

<font face="Tahoma, serif">However, a certain man drew his bow

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The battle raged throughout that day, and
the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. And the
blood from his wound ran out onto the floor of the chariot, and that
evening he died. As the sun was setting, the cry rang out in the
army: </font>
