<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>However, in the third year, Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a><span class="reftext">3</span>who said to his servants, “Do you not know that Ramoth-gilead is ours, but we have failed to take it from the hand of the king of Aram?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth-gilead?” </p><p class="reg1"> Jehoshaphat answered the king of Israel, “I am like you, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and asked them, “Should I go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I refrain?” </p><p class="reg1">“Go up,” they replied, “and the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not still a prophet of the LORD here of whom we can inquire?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>The king of Israel answered, “There is still one man who can ask the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, but only bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” </p><p class="reg1">“The king should not say that!” Jehoshaphat replied.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Dressed in royal attire, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for himself iron horns and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are finished off.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And all the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a></p><p class="hdg">Micaiah Prophesies against Ahab<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(<a href="385.htm#12" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">2 Chronicles 18:12–27</a>)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah instructed him, “Behold now, with one accord the words of the prophets are favorable to the king. So please let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But Micaiah said, “As surely as the LORD lives, I will speak whatever the LORD tells me.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?” </p><p class="reg1">“Go up and triumph,” Micaiah replied, “for the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the LORD?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So Micaiah declared: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I saw all Israel scattered on the hills </p><p class="indent"> like sheep without a shepherd. </p><p class="indent1"> And the LORD said, ‘These people have no master; </p><p class="indent"> let each one return home in peace.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for me, but only bad?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ </p><p class="reg1"> And one suggested this, and another that.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="21"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD, and said, ‘I will entice him.’<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">a</a></span>  </p><p class="reg1">‘By what means?’ asked the LORD.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And he replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ </p><p class="reg1">‘You will surely entice him and prevail,’ said the LORD. ‘Go and do it.’
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="23"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, and the LORD has pronounced disaster against you.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="24"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up, struck Micaiah in the face, and demanded, “Which way did the Spirit of the LORD go when He departed from me to speak with you?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Micaiah replied, “You will soon see, on that day when you go and hide in an inner room.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="26"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>And the king of Israel declared, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="27"></a><span class="reftext">27</span>and tell them that this is what the king says: ‘Put this man in prison and feed him only bread and water until I return safely.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="28"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>But Micaiah replied, “If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Take heed, all you people!”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="29"></a></p><p class="hdg">Ahab’s Defeat and Death<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(<a href="385.htm#28" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">2 Chronicles 18:28–34</a>)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="30"></a><span class="reftext">30</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="31"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="32"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely this is the king of Israel!” So they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="33"></a><span class="reftext">33</span>And when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="34"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>However, a certain man drew his bow without taking special aim, and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. So the king said to his charioteer, “Turn around<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">b</a></span>  and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="35"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>The battle raged throughout that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. And the blood from his wound ran out onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="36"></a><span class="reftext">36</span>As the sun was setting, the cry rang out in the army: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Every man to his own city, </p><p class="indent"> and every man to his own land!”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="37"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>So the king died and was brought to Samaria, where they buried him.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="38"></a><span class="reftext">38</span>And the chariot was washed at the pool of Samaria where the prostitutes bathed,<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">c</a></span>  and the dogs licked up Ahab’s blood, according to the word that the LORD had spoken.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">d</a></span>
