<font ><b>Ahab and the False Prophets</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then three years passed without war
between Aram and Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >However, in the third year, Jehoshaphat
king of Judah went down to visit the king of Israel, who said to his
servants, “Do you not know that Ramoth-gilead is ours, but we have
failed to take it from the hand of the king of Aram?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go
with me to fight against Ramoth-gilead?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoshaphat answered the king of Israel,
“I am like you, my people are your people, and my horses are your
horses.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of
Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king of Israel assembled the
prophets, about four hundred men, and asked them, “Should I go to
war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I refrain?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Go up,” they replied, “and the Lord
will deliver it into the hand of the king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not
still a prophet of the LORD here of whom we can inquire?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The king of Israel answered, “There is
still one man who can ask the LORD, but I hate him because he never
prophesies anything good for me, but only bad. He is Micaiah son of
Imlah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >The king should not say that!”
Jehoshaphat replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king of Israel called one of his
officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Dressed in royal attire, the king of
Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at
the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all
the prophets prophesying before them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for
himself iron horns and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘With
these you shall gore the Arameans until they are finished off.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And all the prophets were prophesying the
same, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the LORD
will deliver it into the hand of the king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the messenger who had gone to call
Micaiah instructed him, “Behold now, with one accord the words of
the prophets are favorable to the king. So please let your words be
like theirs, and speak favorably.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Micaiah said, “As surely as the LORD
lives, I will speak whatever the LORD tells me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him,
“Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we
refrain?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Go up and triumph,” Micaiah replied,
“for the LORD will give it into the hand of the king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the king said to him, “How many
times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in
the name of the LORD?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Micaiah declared: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >I saw all Israel scattered on the hills
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >like sheep without a shepherd. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >And the LORD said, ‘These people have no
master; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >let each one return home in peace.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for
me, but only bad?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the
word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the
host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab
to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And one suggested this, and another that. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a spirit came forward, stood before
the LORD, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
‘<font >By what means?’ asked the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And he replied, ‘I will go out and be a
lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
‘<font >You will surely entice him and
prevail,’ said the LORD. ‘Go and do it.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So you see, the LORD has put a lying
spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours, and the LORD has
pronounced disaster against you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up,
struck Micaiah in the face, and demanded, “Which way did the Spirit
of the LORD go when He departed from me to speak with you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Micaiah replied, “You will soon see, on
that day when you go and hide in an inner room.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the king of Israel declared, “Take
Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash
the king’s son, and tell them that this is what the king says: ‘Put
this man in prison and feed him only bread and water until I return
safely.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Micaiah replied, “If you ever return
safely, the LORD has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Take
heed, all you people!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king
of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. And the king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you
wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and
went into battle. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the king of Aram had ordered his
thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or
great, except the king of Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the chariot commanders saw
Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely this is the king of Israel!” So
they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. And when
the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they
turned back from pursuing him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >However, a certain man drew his bow
without taking special aim, and he struck the king of Israel between
the joints of his armor. So the king said to his charioteer, “Turn
around and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The battle raged throughout that day, and
the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. And the
blood from his wound ran out onto the floor of the chariot, and that
evening he died. As the sun was setting, the cry rang out in the
army: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Every man to his own city, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and every man to his own land!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king died and was brought to
Samaria, where they buried him. And the chariot was washed at the
pool of Samaria where the prostitutes bathed, and the dogs licked up
Ahab’s blood, according to the word that the LORD had spoken. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Ahab, along
with all his accomplishments and the ivory palace and all the cities
he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the
Kings of Israel? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Ahab rested with his fathers, and his
son Ahaziah reigned in his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the fourth year of Ahab’s reign over
Israel, Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah. Jehoshaphat was
thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter
of Shilhi. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehoshaphat walked in all the ways of
his father Asa; he did not turn away from them, but did what was
right in the eyes of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The high places, however, were not
removed; the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high
places. Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of
Jehoshaphat, along with the might he exercised and how he waged war,
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of
Judah? He banished from the land the male shrine prostitutes who
remained from the days of his father Asa. And there was no king in
Edom; a deputy served as king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoshaphat built ships of Tarshish to go
to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail, because they were wrecked
at Ezion-geber. At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat,
“Let my servants sail with your servants,” but Jehoshaphat
refused. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers
and was buried with them in the city of his father David. And his son
Jehoram reigned in his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat’s
reign over Judah, Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he
reigned in Samaria two years. And he did evil in the sight of the
LORD and walked in the ways of his father and mother and of Jeroboam
son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ahaziah served and worshiped Baal,
provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger, just as his father
had done. </font>
