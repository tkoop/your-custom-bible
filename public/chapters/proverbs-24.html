<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Do Not Envy</p><p class="indent1stline"></p><p class="subhdg">Saying 20</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>Do not envy wicked men </p><p class="indent"> or desire their company;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>for their hearts devise violence, </p><p class="indent"> and their lips declare trouble.
</p><p class="subhdg">Saying 21</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>By wisdom a house is built </p><p class="indent"> and by understanding it is established;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>through knowledge its rooms are filled </p><p class="indent"> with every precious and beautiful treasure.
</p><p class="subhdg">Saying 22</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>A wise man is strong,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and a man of knowledge enhances his strength.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Only with sound guidance should you wage war, </p><p class="indent"> and victory lies in a multitude of counsellors.
</p><p class="subhdg">Saying 23</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>Wisdom is too high for a fool; </p><p class="indent"> he does not open his mouth in the meeting place.
</p><p class="subhdg">Saying 24</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>He who plots evil </p><p class="indent"> will be called a schemer.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>A foolish scheme is sin, </p><p class="indent"> and a mocker is detestable to men.
</p><p class="subhdg">Saying 25</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>If you faint in the day of distress, </p><p class="indent"> how small is your strength!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Rescue those being led away to death, </p><p class="indent"> and restrain those stumbling toward the slaughter.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>If you say, “Behold, we did not know about this,” </p><p class="indent"> does not He who weighs hearts consider it? </p><p class="indent1"> Does not the One who guards your life know? </p><p class="indent"> Will He not repay a man according to his deeds?
</p><p class="subhdg">Saying 26</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Eat honey, my son, for it is good, </p><p class="indent"> and the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Know therefore that wisdom is sweet to your soul. </p><p class="indent"> If you find it, there is a future for you, </p><p class="indent"> and your hope will never be cut off.
</p><p class="subhdg">Saying 27</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, near the dwelling of the righteous; </p><p class="indent"> do not destroy his resting place.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>For though a righteous man may fall seven times, he still gets up; </p><p class="indent"> but the wicked stumble in bad times.
</p><p class="subhdg">Saying 28</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>Do not gloat when your enemy falls, </p><p class="indent"> and do not let your heart rejoice when he stumbles,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>or the LORD will see and disapprove, </p><p class="indent"> and turn His wrath away from him.
</p><p class="subhdg">Saying 29</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>Do not fret over evildoers, </p><p class="indent"> and do not be envious of the wicked.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>For the evil man has no future; </p><p class="indent"> the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished.
</p><p class="subhdg">Saying 30</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>My son, fear the LORD and the king, </p><p class="indent"> and do not associate with the rebellious.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>For they will bring sudden destruction. </p><p class="indent"> Who knows what ruin they can bring?
</p><p class="hdg">Further Sayings of the Wise</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>These also are sayings of the wise: </p><p class="indent1"> To show partiality in judgment </p><p class="indent"> is not good.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Whoever tells the guilty, “You are innocent”—</p><p class="indent"> peoples will curse him, and nations will denounce him;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, </p><p class="indent"> and rich blessing will come upon them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>An honest answer given </p><p class="indent"> is like a kiss on the lips.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>Complete your outdoor work and prepare your field; </p><p class="indent"> after that, you may build your house.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">28</span>Do not testify against your neighbour without cause, </p><p class="indent"> and do not deceive with your lips.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me; </p><p class="indent"> I will repay the man according to his work.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">30</span>I went past the field of a slacker </p><p class="indent"> and by the vineyard of a man lacking judgment.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Thorns had grown up everywhere, </p><p class="indent"> thistles had covered the ground, </p><p class="indent"> and the stone wall was broken down.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>I observed and took it to heart; </p><p class="indent"> I looked and received instruction:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>A little sleep, a little slumber, </p><p class="indent"> a little folding of the hands to rest,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">34</span>and poverty will come upon you like a robber, </p><p class="indent"> and need like a bandit.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">The wise are mightier than the strong</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
