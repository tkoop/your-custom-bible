<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Saul’s Disobedience</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Samuel said to Saul, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> sent me to anoint you king over <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> people Israel. Now therefore, listen to the words of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">2</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: ‘I witnessed what the Amalekites did to the Israelites when they ambushed them on their way up from Egypt.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Now go and attack the Amalekites and devote to destruction<span class="fn">a</span>  all that belongs to them. Do not spare them, but put to death men and women, children and infants, oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So Saul summoned the troops and numbered them at Telaim—200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he warned the Kenites, “Since you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt, go on and get away from the Amalekites. Otherwise I will sweep you away with them.” </p><p class="reg1"> So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then Saul struck down the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">8</span>He captured Agag king of Amalek alive, but devoted all the others to destruction with the sword.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Saul and his troops spared Agag, along with the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves<span class="fn">b</span>  and lambs, and the best of everything else. They were unwilling to destroy them, but they devoted to destruction all that was despised and worthless.
</p><p class="hdg">Samuel Denounces Saul</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Samuel, saying,
<span class="reftext">11</span>“I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from following <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and has not carried out <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> instructions.” </p><p class="reg1"> And Samuel was distressed and cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> all that night.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Early in the morning Samuel got up to confront Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel, and behold, he has set up a monument for himself and has turned and gone down to Gilgal.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>When Samuel reached him, Saul said to him, “May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> bless you. I have carried out <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s instructions.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But Samuel replied, “Then what is this bleating of sheep and lowing of cattle that I hear?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Saul answered, “The troops brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best sheep and cattle to sacrifice to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, but the rest we devoted to destruction.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>“Stop!” exclaimed Samuel. “Let me tell you what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me last night.” </p><p class="reg1">“Tell me,” Saul replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>And Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, have you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> anointed you king over Israel
<span class="reftext">18</span>and sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and devote to destruction the sinful Amalekites. Fight against them until <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have wiped them out.’
<span class="reftext">19</span>So why did you not obey <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>? Why did you rush upon the plunder and do evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>“But I did obey <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,” Saul replied. “I went on the mission that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gave me. I brought back Agag king of Amalek and devoted the Amalekites to destruction.
<span class="reftext">21</span>The troops took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of the things devoted to destruction, in order to sacrifice them to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God at Gilgal.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But Samuel declared: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Does <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices </p><p class="indent"> as much as in obedience to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> voice? </p><p class="indent1"> Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice, </p><p class="indent"> and attentiveness is better than the fat of rams.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>For rebellion is like the sin of divination, </p><p class="indent"> and arrogance is like the wickedness of idolatry. </p><p class="indent1"> Because you have rejected the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, </p><p class="indent"> He has rejected you as king.”
</p><p class="hdg">Saul’s Confession</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; I have transgressed <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s commandment and your instructions, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Now therefore, please forgive my sin and return with me so I can worship <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>“I will not return with you,” Samuel replied. “For you have rejected the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has rejected you as king over Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the hem of his robe, and it tore.
<span class="reftext">28</span>So Samuel said to him, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> who is better than you.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Moreover, the <span class='cap'>Glory</span><span class='nocap'>glory</span> of Israel does not lie or change <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mind, for <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is not a man, that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> should change <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mind.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>“I have sinned,” Saul replied. “Please <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> me now before the elders of my people and before Israel. Come back with me, so that I may worship <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.” </p><p class="reg1"> Agag came to him cheerfully,<span class="fn">c</span>  for he thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>But Samuel declared: </p><p class="indent1stline">“As your sword has made women childless, </p><p class="indent"> so your mother will be childless among women.” </p><p class="reg1"> And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> at Gilgal.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.
<span class="reftext">35</span>And to the day of his death, Samuel never again visited Saul. Samuel mourned for Saul, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> regretted that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had made Saul king over Israel.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">cherem</i> refer to the giving over of things or persons to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in verses 8, 9, 15, 18, 20, and 21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the grown bulls</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">32</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">cautiously</i> or <i class="calibre6">in chains</i>; see DSS and LXX.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">32</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">“Surely this is the bitterness of death.”</i> See DSS and LXX.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
