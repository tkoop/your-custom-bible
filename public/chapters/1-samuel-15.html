<font ><b>Samuel Denounces Saul</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Samuel said to Saul, “The LORD sent
me to anoint you king over His people Israel. Now therefore, listen
to the words of the LORD. This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘I
witnessed what the Amalekites did to the Israelites when they
ambushed them on their way up from Egypt. Now go and attack the
Amalekites and devote to destruction all that belongs to them. Do not
spare them, but put to death men and women, children and infants,
oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Saul summoned the troops and numbered
them at Telaim—200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. Saul
came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley. And he
warned the Kenites, “Since you showed kindness to all the
Israelites when they came up out of Egypt, go on and get away from
the Amalekites. Otherwise I will sweep you away with them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the Kenites moved away from the
Amalekites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Saul struck down the Amalekites all
the way from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt. He captured
Agag king of Amalek alive, but devoted all the others to destruction
with the sword. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Saul and his troops spared Agag, along
with the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs, and
the best of everything else. They were unwilling to destroy them, but
they devoted to destruction all that was despised and worthless. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel,
saying, “I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned
away from following Me and has not carried out My instructions.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Samuel was distressed and cried out to
the LORD all that night. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Early in the morning Samuel got up to
confront Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel, and
behold, he has set up a monument for himself and has turned and gone
down to Gilgal.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Samuel reached him, Saul said to him,
“May the LORD bless you. I have carried out the LORD’s
instructions.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Samuel replied, “Then what is this
bleating of sheep and lowing of cattle that I hear?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Saul answered, “The troops brought them
from the Amalekites; they spared the best sheep and cattle to
sacrifice to the LORD your God, but the rest we devoted to
destruction.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Stop!” exclaimed Samuel. “Let me
tell you what the LORD said to me last night.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Tell me,” Saul replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Samuel said, “Although you were once
small in your own eyes, have you not become the head of the tribes of
Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel and sent you on a
mission, saying, ‘Go and devote to destruction the sinful
Amalekites. Fight against them until you have wiped them out.’ So
why did you not obey the LORD? Why did you rush upon the plunder and
do evil in the sight of the LORD?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >But I did obey the LORD,” Saul
replied. “I went on the mission that the LORD gave me. I brought
back Agag king of Amalek and devoted the Amalekites to destruction.
The troops took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of the
things devoted to destruction, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD
your God at Gilgal.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Samuel declared: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Does the LORD delight in burnt
offerings and sacrifices </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >as much as in obedience to His voice? </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Behold, obedience is better than
sacrifice, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and attentiveness is better than the fat
of rams. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >For rebellion is like the sin of
divination, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and arrogance is like the wickedness of
idolatry. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Because you have rejected the word of the
LORD, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He has rejected you as king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have
sinned; I have transgressed the LORD’s commandment and your
instructions, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice. Now
therefore, please forgive my sin and return with me so I can worship
the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I will not return with you,” Samuel
replied. “For you have rejected the word of the LORD, and He has
rejected you as king over Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the
hem of his robe, and it tore. So Samuel said to him, “The LORD has
torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your
neighbor who is better than you. Moreover, the Glory of Israel does
not lie or change His mind, for He is not a man, that He should
change His mind.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I have sinned,” Saul replied. “Please
honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel. Come
back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul
worshiped the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of
the Amalekites.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Agag came to him cheerfully, for he
thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Samuel declared: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >As your sword has made women childless,
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >so your mother will be childless among
women.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before
the LORD at Gilgal. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went
up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. And to the day of his death, Samuel
never again visited Saul. Samuel mourned for Saul, and the LORD
regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel. </font>
