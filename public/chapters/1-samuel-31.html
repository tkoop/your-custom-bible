<font ><b>Saul’s Overthrow and Death</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Philistines fought against Israel,
and the men of Israel fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount
Gilboa. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Philistines followed hard after Saul
and his sons, and they killed Saul’s sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and
Malchishua. When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers
overtook him and wounded him critically. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw
your sword and run it through me, or these uncircumcised men will
come and run me through and torture me!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But his armor-bearer was terrified and
refused to do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was
dead, he too fell on his own sword and died with him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Saul, his three sons, his armor-bearer,
and all his men died together that same day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Israelites along the valley and
those on the other side of the Jordan saw that the army of Israel had
fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their cities
and ran away. So the Philistines came and occupied their cities. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day, when the Philistines came to
strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount
Gilboa. They cut off Saul’s head, stripped off his armor, and sent
messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the
news in the temples of their idols and among their people. They put
his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and hung his body on the
wall of Beth-shan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the people of Jabesh-gilead heard
what the Philistines had done to Saul, all their men of valor set
out, journeyed all night, and retrieved the bodies of Saul and his
sons from the wall of Beth-shan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they arrived at Jabesh, they burned
the bodies there. Then they took their bones and buried them under
the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days. </font>
