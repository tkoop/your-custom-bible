<span class="reftext">2</span>said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels of silver<span class="fn">a</span>  that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse—I have the silver here with me; I took it.” </p><p class="reg1"> Then his mother said, “Blessed be my son by <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And when he had returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, “I wholly dedicate the silver to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> for my son’s benefit, to make a graven image and a molten idol. Therefore I will now return it to you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took two hundred shekels of silver<span class="fn">b</span>  and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into a graven image and a molten idol. And they were placed in the house of Micah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household idols, and ordained<span class="fn">c</span>  one of his sons as his priest.
<span class="reftext">6</span>In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>And there was a young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah who had been residing within the clan of Judah.
<span class="reftext">8</span>This man left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to settle where he could find a place. And as he <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span>, he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“Where are you from?” Micah asked him. </p><p class="reg1">“I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” he replied, “and I am on my way to settle wherever I can find a place.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>“Stay with me,” Micah said to him, “and be my father and priest, and I will give you ten shekels of silver<span class="fn">d</span>  per year, a suit of clothes, and your provisions.” </p><p class="reg1"> So the Levite went in
<span class="reftext">11</span>and agreed to stay with him, and the young man became like a son to Micah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Then Micah said, “Now I know that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will be good to me, because a Levite has become my priest.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">1,100 shekels</i> is approximately 27.6 pounds or 12.5 kilograms of silver; also in verse 3.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">200 shekels</i> is approximately 5 pounds or 2.3 kilograms of silver.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">filled the hand of</i>; also in verse 12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">10 shekels</i> is approximately 4 ounces or 114 grams of silver.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
