<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Hezekiah Proclaims a Passover</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Hezekiah sent word throughout all
Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh
inviting them to come to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem to keep
the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel. For the king and his
officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem had decided to keep the
Passover in the second month, since they had been unable to observe
it at the regular time, because not enough priests had consecrated
themselves and the people had not been gathered in Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This proposal pleased the king and the
whole assembly. So they established a decree to circulate a
proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that the
people should come to keep the Passover of the LORD, the God of
Israel, in Jerusalem. For they had not observed it as a nation as
prescribed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the couriers went throughout Israel and
Judah with letters from the king and his officials, which read: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Children of Israel, return to the LORD,
the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so that He may return to those
of you who remain, who have escaped the grasp of the kings of
Assyria. Do not be like your fathers and brothers who were unfaithful
to the LORD, the God of their fathers, so that He made them an object
of horror, as you can see. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now do not stiffen your necks as your
fathers did. Submit to the LORD and come to His sanctuary, which He
has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God, so that His fierce
anger will turn away from you. For if you return to the LORD, your
brothers and sons will receive mercy in the presence of their captors
and will return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and
merciful; He will not turn His face away from you if you return to
Him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the couriers traveled from city to
city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun; but
the people scorned and mocked them. Nevertheless, some from Asher,
Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
Moreover, the power of God was on the people in Judah to give them
one heart to obey the command of the king and his officials according
to the word of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the second month, a very great assembly
gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
They proceeded to remove the altars in Jerusalem and to take away the
incense altars and throw them into the Kidron Valley. And on the
fourteenth day of the second month they slaughtered the Passover
lamb. The priests and Levites were ashamed, and they consecrated
themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They stood at their prescribed posts,
according to the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled
the blood, which they received from the hand of the Levites. Since
there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves,
the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for
every unclean person to consecrate the lambs to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">A large number of the people—many from
Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun—had not purified
themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written.
But Hezekiah interceded for them, saying, “May the LORD, who is
good, provide atonement for everyone who sets his heart on seeking
God—the LORD, the God of his fathers—even if he is not cleansed
according to the purification rules of the sanctuary.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the
people. The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the
Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy, and the
Levites and priests praised the LORD day after day, accompanied by
loud instruments of praise to the LORD. And Hezekiah encouraged all
the Levites who performed skillfully before the LORD. For seven days
they ate their assigned portion, sacrificing fellowship offerings and
giving thanks to the LORD, the God of their fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The whole assembly agreed to observe seven
more days, so they observed seven days with joy. For Hezekiah king of
Judah contributed a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the
assembly, and the officials contributed a thousand bulls and ten
thousand sheep for the assembly, and a great number of priests
consecrated themselves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the whole assembly of Judah rejoiced
along with the priests and Levites and the whole assembly that had
come from Israel, including the foreigners who had come from Israel
and those who lived in Judah. So there was great rejoicing in
Jerusalem, for nothing like this had happened there since the days of
Solomon son of David king of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the priests and the Levites stood to
bless the people, and God heard their voice, and their prayer came
into His holy dwelling place in heaven. </font>
