<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Hezekiah Cleanses the Temple<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 18:1–12)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abijah,<span class="fn">a</span>  the daughter of Zechariah.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And he did what was right in the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, just as his father David had done.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>In the first month of the first year of his reign, Hezekiah opened and repaired the doors of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then he brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in the square on the east side.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>“Listen to me, O Levites,” he said. “Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of your fathers. Remove from the Holy Place every impurity.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For our fathers were unfaithful and did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God. They abandoned Him, turned their faces away from the dwelling place of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and turned their backs on Him.
<span class="reftext">7</span>They also shut the doors of the portico and extinguished the lamps. They did not burn incense or present burnt offerings in the Holy Place of the God of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore, the wrath of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has fallen upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, horror, and mockery, as you can see with your own eyes.
<span class="reftext">9</span>For behold, this is why our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and daughters and wives are in captivity.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, so that His fierce anger will turn away from us.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Now, my sons, do not be negligent, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, to minister before Him, and to burn incense.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then the Levites set to work: </p><p class="list1stline"> Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah from the Kohathites; </p><p class="list1stline"> Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the Merarites; </p><p class="list1stline"> Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershonites;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Shimri and Jeuel from the Elizaphanites; </p><p class="list1stline"> Zechariah and Mattaniah from the Asaphites;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>Jehiel and Shimei from the Hemanites; </p><p class="list1stline"> and Shemaiah and Uzziel from the Jeduthunites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>When they had assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves, they went in to cleanse the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, according to the command of the king by the words of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So the priests went inside the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to cleanse it, and they brought out to the courtyard all the unclean things that they found in the temple of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. Then the Levites took these things and carried them out to the Kidron Valley.
<span class="reftext">17</span>They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. For eight more days they consecrated the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported, “We have cleansed the entire house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table of the showbread with all its utensils.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Moreover, we have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz in his unfaithfulness cast aside during his reign. They are now in front of the altar of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”
</p><p class="hdg">Hezekiah Restores Temple Worship</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials and went up to the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">21</span>They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And the king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. And they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then they brought the goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly, who laid their hands on them.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And the priests slaughtered the goats and put their blood on the altar for a sin offering, to make atonement for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> with cymbals, harps, and lyres according to the command of David, of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the prophet. For the command had come from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> through His prophets.
<span class="reftext">26</span>The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>And Hezekiah ordered that the burnt offering be sacrificed on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and the trumpets began as well, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel.
<span class="reftext">28</span>The whole assembly was worshiping, the singers were singing, and the trumpeters were playing. All this continued until the burnt offering was completed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>When the offerings were completed, the king and all those present with him bowed down and worshiped.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Then King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> in the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then Hezekiah said, “Now that you have consecrated yourselves to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,<span class="fn">b</span>  come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.” </p><p class="reg1"> So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings.
<span class="reftext">32</span>The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">33</span>And the consecrated offerings were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>However, since there were not enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings, their Levite brothers helped them until the work was finished and until the priests had been consecrated. For the Levites had been more diligent in consecrating themselves than the priests had been.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Furthermore, the burnt offerings were abundant, along with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was established.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had prepared for the people, because everything had been accomplished so quickly.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Abijah</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Abi</i>; see 2 Kings 18:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">filled your hand for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span></i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
