<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His
mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. And he did
what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father David had
done. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the first month of the first year of
his reign, Hezekiah opened and repaired the doors of the house of the
LORD. Then he brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in
the square on the east side. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Listen to me, O Levites,” he said.
“Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the house of the LORD,
the God of your fathers. Remove from the Holy Place every impurity. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For our fathers were unfaithful and did
evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They abandoned Him, turned
their faces away from the dwelling place of the LORD, and turned
their backs on Him. They also shut the doors of the portico and
extinguished the lamps. They did not burn incense or present burnt
offerings in the Holy Place of the God of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, the wrath of the LORD has
fallen upon Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of
terror, horror, and mockery, as you can see with your own eyes. For
behold, this is why our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our
sons and daughters and wives are in captivity. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now it is in my heart to make a covenant
with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that His fierce anger will turn
away from us. Now, my sons, do not be negligent, for the LORD has
chosen you to stand before Him, to serve Him, to minister before Him,
and to burn incense.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When they had assembled their brothers and
consecrated themselves, they went in to cleanse the house of the
LORD, according to the command of the king by the words of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the priests went inside the house of
the LORD to cleanse it, and they brought out to the courtyard all the
unclean things that they found in the temple of the LORD. Then the
Levites took these things and carried them out to the Kidron Valley.
They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and
on the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the LORD.
For eight more days they consecrated the house of the LORD itself,
finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they went in to King Hezekiah and
reported, “We have cleansed the entire house of the LORD, the altar
of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table of the
showbread with all its utensils. Moreover, we have prepared and
consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz in his unfaithfulness
cast aside during his reign. They are now in front of the altar of
the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Early the next morning King Hezekiah
gathered the city officials and went up to the house of the LORD.
They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male
goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for
Judah. And the king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron,
to offer them on the altar of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they slaughtered the bulls, and the
priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They
slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. And they
slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they brought the goats for the sin
offering before the king and the assembly, who laid their hands on
them. And the priests slaughtered the goats and put their blood on
the altar for a sin offering, to make atonement for all Israel,
because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering
for all Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the
house of the LORD with cymbals, harps, and lyres according to the
command of David, of Gad the king’s seer, and of Nathan the
prophet. For the command had come from the LORD through His prophets.
The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with
the trumpets. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Hezekiah ordered that the burnt
offering be sacrificed on the altar. When the burnt offering began,
the song of the LORD and the trumpets began as well, accompanied by
the instruments of David king of Israel. The whole assembly was
worshiping, the singers were singing, and the trumpeters were
playing. All this continued until the burnt offering was completed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the offerings were completed, the
king and all those present with him bowed down and worshiped. Then
King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to sing praises
to the LORD in the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang
praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Hezekiah said, “Now that you have
consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices
and thank offerings to the house of the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the assembly brought sacrifices and
thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt
offerings. The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was
seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were
for a burnt offering to the LORD. And the consecrated offerings were
six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">However, since there were not enough
priests to skin all the burnt offerings, their Levite brothers helped
them until the work was finished and until the priests had been
consecrated. For the Levites had been more diligent in consecrating
themselves than the priests had been. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Furthermore, the burnt offerings were
abundant, along with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink
offerings for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of the
LORD was established. Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at
what God had prepared for the people, because everything had been
accomplished so quickly. </font>
