before me was a white horse. And its rider is called Faithful and
True. With righteousness He judges and wages war. He has eyes like
blazing fire, and many royal crowns on His head. He has a name
written on Him that only He Himself knows. He is dressed in a robe
dipped in blood, and His name is The Word of God. </font>

proceeds a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and He
will rule them with an iron scepter. He treads the winepress of the
fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. And He has a name written on
His robe and on His thigh: </font>

eat the flesh of kings and commanders and mighty men, of horses and
riders, of everyone slave and free, small and great.” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I saw the beast and the kings of the
earth with their armies assembled to wage war against the One seated
on the horse, and against His army. But the beast was captured along
with the false prophet, who on its behalf had performed signs
deceiving those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its
image. Both the beast and the false prophet were thrown alive into
the fiery lake of burning sulfur. And the rest were killed with the
sword that proceeded from the mouth of the One seated on the horse. </font>
