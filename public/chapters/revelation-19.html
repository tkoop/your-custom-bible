<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Rejoicing in Heaven</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After this I heard a sound like the roar of a great multitude in heaven, shouting: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Hallelujah!<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent1stline"> Salvation and glory and power belong to our God!
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">2</span>For His judgments are true and just. </p><p class="indent1"> He has judged the great prostitute </p><p class="indent"> who corrupted the earth with her immorality. </p><p class="indent1"> He has avenged the blood of His servants </p><p class="indent"> that was poured out by her hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And a second time they called out: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Hallelujah! </p><p class="indent1stline"> Her smoke rises forever and ever.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Amen, Hallelujah!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then a voice came from the throne, saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Praise our God, </p><p class="indent"> all you who serve Him, </p><p class="indent1"> and those who fear Him, </p><p class="indent"> small and great alike!”
</p><p class="hdg">The Marriage of the Lamb</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>And I heard a sound like the roar of a great multitude, like the rushing of many waters, and like a mighty rumbling of thunder, crying out: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Hallelujah! </p><p class="indent1stline"> For the Lord our God<span class="fn">b</span>  the Almighty reigns.
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">7</span>Let us rejoice and be glad </p><p class="indent"> and give Him the glory. </p><p class="indent1"> For the marriage of the Lamb has come, </p><p class="indent"> and His bride has made herself ready.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>She was given clothing of fine linen, </p><p class="indent"> bright and pure.” </p><p class="reg1"> For the fine linen she wears is the righteous acts of the saints.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then the angel told me to write, “Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So I fell at his feet to worship him. But he told me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who rely on the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Rider on the White Horse</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then I saw heaven standing open, and there before me was a white horse. And its rider is called Faithful and True. With righteousness He judges and wages war.
<span class="reftext">12</span>He has eyes like blazing fire, and many royal crowns on His head. He has a name written on Him that only He Himself knows.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood,<span class="fn">c</span>  and His name is The Word of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The armies of heaven, dressed in fine linen, white and pure, follow Him on white horses.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And from His mouth proceeds a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and He will rule them with an iron sceptre.<span class="fn">d</span>  He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And He has a name written on His robe and on His thigh: </p><p class="reg1"></p><div class="inscrip1"> KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</div>
<p class="calibre3"></p><p class="hdg">Defeat of the Beast and False Prophet</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out in a loud voice to all the birds flying overhead, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God,
<span class="reftext">18</span>so that you may eat the flesh of kings and commanders and mighty men, of horses and riders, of everyone slave and free, small and great.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies assembled to wage war against the One seated on the horse, and against His army.
<span class="reftext">20</span>But the beast was captured along with the false prophet, who on its behalf had performed signs deceiving those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. Both the beast and the false prophet were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulphur.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And the rest were killed with the sword that proceeded from the mouth of the One seated on the horse. </p><p class="reg1"> And all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Hallelujah</i> is a transliteration of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Hallelu YAH</i>, meaning <i class="calibre6">Praise the LORD</i>; also in verses 3, 4, and 6.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> SBL, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">the Lord God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> WH <i class="calibre6">sprinkled with blood</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> See Psalm 2:9 (see also LXX).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
