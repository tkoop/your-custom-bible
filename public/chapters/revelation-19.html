<font >After this I heard a sound like the roar
of a great multitude in heaven, shouting: </font>

“<font >Hallelujah! </font>

<font >Salvation and glory and power belong to

<font >For His judgments are true and just. </font>

<font >He has avenged the blood of His servants </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And a second time they called out: </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the twenty-four elders and the four
living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne,
saying: </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Amen, Hallelujah!” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a voice came from the throne, saying:

<font >And I heard a sound like the roar of a
great multitude, like the rushing of many waters, and like a mighty
rumbling of thunder, crying out: </font>

“<font >Hallelujah! </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >For the marriage of the Lamb has come, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >She was given clothing of fine linen, </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the fine linen she wears is the
righteous acts of the saints. </font>

<font >Then the angel told me to write, “Blessed
are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And
he said to me, “These are the true words of God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I fell at his feet to worship him. But
he told me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and
your brothers who rely on the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For
the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I saw heaven standing open, and there
before me was a white horse. And its rider is called Faithful and
True. With righteousness He judges and wages war. He has eyes like
blazing fire, and many royal crowns on His head. He has a name
written on Him that only He Himself knows. He is dressed in a robe
dipped in blood, and His name is The Word of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The armies of heaven, dressed in fine
linen, white and pure, follow Him on white horses. And from His mouth
proceeds a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and He
will rule them with an iron scepter. He treads the winepress of the
fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. And He has a name written on
His robe and on His thigh: </font>

<p class="western" align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
<span style="text-transform: uppercase"><font >KING
OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</font></span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I saw an angel standing in the sun,
and he cried out in a loud voice to all the birds flying overhead,
“Come, gather together for the great supper of God, so that you may
eat the flesh of kings and commanders and mighty men, of horses and
riders, of everyone slave and free, small and great.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I saw the beast and the kings of the
earth with their armies assembled to wage war against the One seated
on the horse, and against His army. But the beast was captured along
with the false prophet, who on its behalf had performed signs
deceiving those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its
image. Both the beast and the false prophet were thrown alive into
the fiery lake of burning sulfur. And the rest were killed with the
sword that proceeded from the mouth of the One seated on the horse. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And all the birds gorged themselves on
their flesh. </font>
