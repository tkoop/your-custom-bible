<font ><b>Mordecai Appeals to Esther</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Mordecai learned of all that had
happened, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went
out into the middle of the city, wailing loudly and bitterly. But he
went only as far as the king’s gate, because the law prohibited
anyone wearing sackcloth from entering that gate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >In every province to which the king’s
command and edict came, there was great mourning among the Jews. They
fasted, wept, and lamented, and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Esther’s maidens and eunuchs came
and told her about Mordecai, the queen was overcome with distress.
She sent clothes for Mordecai to wear instead of his sackcloth, but
he would not accept them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the
king’s eunuchs appointed to her, and she dispatched him to Mordecai
to learn what was troubling him and why. So Hathach went out to
Mordecai in the city square in front of the king’s gate, and
Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, including the exact
amount of money that Haman had promised to pay into the royal
treasury in order to destroy the Jews. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Mordecai also gave Hathach a copy of the
written decree issued in Susa for the destruction of the Jews, to
show and explain to Esther, urging her to approach the king, implore
his favor, and plead before him for her people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Hathach went back and relayed
Mordecai’s response to Esther. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Esther spoke to Hathach and
instructed him to tell Mordecai, “All the royal officials and the
people of the king’s provinces know that one law applies to every
man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being
summoned—that he be put to death. Only if the king extends the gold
scepter may that person live. But I have not been summoned to appear
before the king for the past thirty days.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Esther’s words were relayed to
Mordecai, he sent back to her this reply: “Do not imagine that
because you are in the king’s palace you alone will escape the fate
of all the Jews. For if you remain silent at this time, relief and
deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and
your father’s house will perish. And who knows if perhaps you have
come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:
“Go and assemble all the Jews who can be found in Susa, and fast
for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day, and I and
my maidens will fast as you do. After that, I will go to the king,
even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Mordecai went and did all that Esther
had instructed him. </font>
