had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, he sent his
son Hadoram to greet King David and bless him for fighting and
defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought
all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze, and King David
dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had
carried off from all these nations—from Edom and Moab, and from the
Ammonites, Philistines, and Amalekites. </font>
