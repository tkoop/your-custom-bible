</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>David also defeated the Moabites, and they became subject to David and brought him tribute.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>As far as Hamath, David also defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah, who had marched out to establish his dominion<span class="fn">a</span>  along the Euphrates River.
<span class="reftext">4</span>David captured from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand charioteers, and twenty thousand foot soldiers, and he hamstrung all the horses except a hundred he kept for the chariots.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When the Arameans of Damascus came to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand men.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then he placed garrisons<span class="fn">b</span>  in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to David and brought him tribute. So the LORD made David victorious<span class="fn">c</span>  wherever he went.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>And David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And from Tibhath<span class="fn">d</span>  and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took a large amount of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze Sea, the pillars, and various bronze articles.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>When King Tou<span class="fn">e</span>  of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
<span class="reftext">10</span>he sent his son Hadoram<span class="fn">f</span>  to greet King David and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze,
<span class="reftext">11</span>and King David dedicated these to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had carried off from all these nations—from Edom and Moab, and from the Ammonites, Philistines, and Amalekites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Moreover, Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He placed garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
