Israelites to do as follows with one who sins unintentionally against
any of the LORD’s commandments and does what is forbidden by them: </font>

<font >If the anointed priest sins, bringing
guilt on the people, he must bring to the LORD a young bull without
blemish as a sin offering for the sin he has committed. He must bring
the bull to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD, lay
his hand on the bull’s head, and slaughter it before the LORD. Then
the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and bring
it into the Tent of Meeting. The priest is to dip his finger in the
blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the LORD, in front
of the veil of the sanctuary. The priest must then put some of the
blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense that is before
the LORD in the Tent of Meeting. And he is to pour out the rest of
the bull’s blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Then he shall remove all the fat
from the bull of the sin offering—the fat that covers the entrails,
all the fat that is on them, both kidneys with the fat on them near
the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he is to remove with the
kidneys— just as the fat is removed from the ox of the peace
offering. Then the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt
offering. But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, with its head
and legs and its entrails and dung— all the rest of the bull—he
must take outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place where the
ashes are poured out, and there he must burn it on a wood fire on the
ash heap. </font>

<font >Now if the whole congregation of Israel
strays unintentionally and the matter escapes the notice of the
assembly so that they violate any of the LORD’s commandments and
incur guilt by doing what is forbidden, when they become aware of the
sin they have committed, then the assembly must bring a young bull as
a sin offering and present it before the Tent of Meeting. The elders
of the congregation are to lay their hands on the bull’s head
before the LORD, and it shall be slaughtered before the LORD. Then
the anointed priest is to bring some of the bull’s blood into the
Tent of Meeting, and he is to dip his finger in the blood and
sprinkle it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil. He is
also to put some of the blood on the horns of the altar that is
before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting, and he must pour out the rest
of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting. And he is to remove all the fat from
it and burn it on the altar. He shall offer this bull just as he did
the bull for the sin offering; in this way the priest will make
atonement on their behalf, and they will be forgiven. Then he is to
take the bull outside the camp and burn it, just as he burned the
first bull. It is the sin offering for the assembly. </font>

<font >When a leader sins unintentionally and
does what is prohibited by any of the commandments of the LORD his
God, he incurs guilt. When he becomes aware of the sin he has
committed, he must bring an unblemished male goat as his offering. He
is to lay his hand on the head of the goat and slaughter it at the
place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the LORD. It is
a sin offering. Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the
sin offering with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar of
burnt offering, and pour out the rest of the blood at the base of the
altar. He must burn all its fat on the altar, like the fat of the
peace offerings; thus the priest will make atonement for that man’s
sin, and he will be forgiven. </font>

<font >And if one of the common people sins
unintentionally and does what is prohibited by any of the LORD’s
commandments, he incurs guilt. When he becomes aware of the sin he
has committed, he must bring an unblemished female goat as his
offering for that sin. He is to lay his hand on the head of the sin
offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering. Then
the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger, put it on
the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of
the blood at the base of the altar. Then he is to remove all the fat,

finger, put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour
out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. And he shall
remove all the fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the
peace offerings, and he shall burn it on the altar along with the
offerings made by fire to the LORD. In this way the priest will make
atonement for him for the sin he has committed, and he will be
forgiven. </font>
