</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>Rebuke your mother, </p><p class="indent"> rebuke her, </p><p class="indent1"> for she is not My wife, </p><p class="indent"> and I am not her husband. </p><p class="indent1"> Let her remove the adultery from her face </p><p class="indent"> and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Otherwise, I will strip her naked </p><p class="indent"> and expose her like the day of her birth. </p><p class="indent1"> I will make her like a desert </p><p class="indent"> and turn her into a parched land, </p><p class="indent"> and I will let her die of thirst.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I will have no compassion on her children, </p><p class="indent"> because they are the children of adultery.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>For their mother has played the harlot </p><p class="indent"> and has conceived them in disgrace. </p><p class="indent1"> For she thought, </p><p class="indent">‘I will go after my lovers, </p><p class="indent1"> who give me bread and water, </p><p class="indent"> wool and linen, oil and drink.’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore, behold, </p><p class="indent"> I will hedge up her path<span class="fn">c</span>  with thorns; </p><p class="indent1"> I will enclose her with a wall, </p><p class="indent"> so she cannot find her way.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>She will pursue her lovers but not catch them; </p><p class="indent"> she will seek them but not find them. </p><p class="indent1"> Then she will say, </p><p class="indent">‘I will return to my first husband, </p><p class="indent"> for then I was better off than now.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>For she does not acknowledge </p><p class="indent"> that it was I who gave her grain, </p><p class="indent"> new wine, and oil, </p><p class="indent1"> who lavished on her silver and gold—</p><p class="indent"> which they crafted for Baal.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Therefore I will take back My grain in its time </p><p class="indent"> and My new wine in its season; </p><p class="indent1"> I will take away My wool and linen, </p><p class="indent"> which were given to cover her nakedness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And then I will expose her lewdness </p><p class="indent"> in the sight of her lovers, </p><p class="indent1"> and no one will deliver her </p><p class="indent"> out of My hands.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>I will put an end to all her exultation: </p><p class="indent"> her feasts, New Moons, and Sabbaths—</p><p class="indent"> all her appointed feasts.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>I will destroy her vines and fig trees, </p><p class="indent"> which she thinks are the wages paid by her lovers. </p><p class="indent1"> So I will make them into a thicket, </p><p class="indent"> and the beasts of the field will devour them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I will punish her for the days of the Baals </p><p class="indent"> when she burned incense to them, </p><p class="indent1"> when she decked herself with rings and jewelry, </p><p class="indent"> and went after her lovers. </p><p class="indent1stline"> But Me she forgot,” </p><p class="selah"> declares the LORD.
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Mercy to Israel</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>“Therefore, behold, I will allure her </p><p class="indent"> and lead her to the wilderness, </p><p class="indent"> and speak to her tenderly.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>There I will give back her vineyards </p><p class="indent"> and make the Valley of Achor<span class="fn">d</span>  </p><p class="indent"> into a gateway of hope. </p><p class="indent1"> There she will respond as she did </p><p class="indent"> in the days of her youth, </p><p class="indent"> as in the day she came up out of Egypt.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>In that day,” </p><p class="indent"> declares the LORD, </p><p class="indent1">“you will call Me ‘my Husband,’<span class="fn">e</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and no longer call Me ‘my Master.’<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>For I will remove from her lips the names of the Baals; </p><p class="indent"> no longer will their names be invoked.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>On that day I will make a covenant for them </p><p class="indent"> with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air </p><p class="indent"> and the creatures that crawl on the ground. </p><p class="indent1"> And I will abolish bow and sword </p><p class="indent"> and weapons of war in the land, </p><p class="indent"> and will make them lie down in safety.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So I will betroth you to Me forever; </p><p class="indent"> I will betroth you in righteousness and justice, </p><p class="indent"> in loving devotion<span class="fn">g</span>  and compassion.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And I will betroth you in faithfulness, </p><p class="indent"> and you will know the LORD.”
