<span class="reftext">2</span>By this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> commandments.
<span class="reftext">3</span>For this is the love of God, that we keep <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> commandments. And <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> commandments are not burdensome,
<span class="reftext">4</span>because everyone born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world: our faith.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Who then overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span> of God.
<span class="reftext">6</span>This is the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ—not by water alone, but by water and blood. And it is the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> who testifies to this, because the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> is the truth.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For there are three that testify:<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">8</span>the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, the water, and the blood—and these three are in agreement.
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Testimony about His Son</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Even if we accept human testimony, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony that God has given about <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span>.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Whoever believes in the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span> of God has this testimony within him; whoever does not believe God has made <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> out to be a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given about <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And this is that testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span>.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Whoever has the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span> has life; whoever does not have the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span> of God does not have life.

<span class="reftext">14</span>And this is the confidence that we have before <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>: If we ask anything according to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> will, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> hears us.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And if we know that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we already possess what we have asked of <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he should ask God, who will give life to those who commit this kind of sin. There is a sin that leads to death; I am not saying he should ask regarding that sin.
<span class="reftext">17</span>All unrighteousness is sin, yet there is sin that does not lead to death.
</p><p class="hdg">The True God</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>We know that anyone born of God does not keep on sinning; the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who was born of God protects him,<span class="fn">d</span>  and the evil one<span class="fn">e</span>  cannot touch him.
<span class="reftext">19</span>We know that we are of God, and that the whole world is under the power of the evil one.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And we know that the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span> of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> who is true; and we are in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> who is true—in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span> Jesus Christ.
