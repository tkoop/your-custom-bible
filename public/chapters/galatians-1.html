<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Paul’s Greeting to the Galatians</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead—
<span class="reftext">2</span>and all the brothers with me, </p><p class="reg1"> To the churches of Galatia:
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
<span class="reftext">5</span>to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
</p><p class="hdg">No Other Gospel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>I am amazed how quickly you are deserting the One who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—
<span class="reftext">7</span>which is not even a gospel. Evidently some people are troubling you and trying to distort the gospel of Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be under a curse!
<span class="reftext">9</span>As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be under a curse!
</p><p class="hdg">Paul Preaches the Gospel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Am I now seeking the approval of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For I certify to you, brothers, that the gospel I preached was not devised by man.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">12</span>I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how severely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.
<span class="reftext">14</span>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased
<span class="reftext">16</span>to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not rush to consult with flesh and blood,
<span class="reftext">17</span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles who came before me, but I went into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Only after three years did I go up to Jerusalem to confer with Cephas,<span class="fn">c</span>  and I stayed with him fifteen days.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother.
<span class="reftext">20</span>I assure you before God that what I am writing to you is no lie.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Later I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
<span class="reftext">22</span>I was personally unknown, however, to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
<span class="reftext">23</span>They only heard the account: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”
<span class="reftext">24</span>And they glorified God because of me.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> SBL, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">not according to man</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, Peter<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
