<font >I am amazed how quickly you are deserting
the One who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a
different gospel— which is not even a gospel. Evidently some people
are troubling you and trying to distort the gospel of Christ. </font>

<font >But even if we or an angel from heaven
should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let
him be under a curse! As we have said before, so now I say again: If
anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received,
let him be under a curse! </font>

<font >Am I now seeking the approval of men, or
of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to
please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. For I certify to you,
brothers, that the gospel I preached was not devised by man. I did
not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received
it by revelation from Jesus Christ. </font>

<font >For you have heard of my former way of
life in Judaism, how severely I persecuted the church of God and
tried to destroy it. I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my
contemporaries and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my
fathers. </font>

<font >But when God, who set me apart from my
mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased to reveal His
Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not
rush to consult with flesh and blood, nor did I go up to Jerusalem to
the apostles who came before me, but I went into Arabia and later
returned to Damascus. </font>

<font >Only after three years did I go up to
Jerusalem to confer with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days.
But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s
brother. I assure you before God that what I am writing to you is no
lie. </font>

<font >Later I went to the regions of Syria and
Cilicia. I was personally unknown, however, to the churches of Judea
that are in Christ. They only heard the account: “The man who
formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to
destroy.” And they glorified God because of me. </font>
