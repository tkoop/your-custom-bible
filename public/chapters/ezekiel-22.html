<font >Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “As for you, son of man, will you judge her? Will you pass
judgment on the city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her
abominations and tell her that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘O
city who brings her own doom by shedding blood within her walls and
making idols to defile herself, you are guilty of the blood you have
shed, and you are defiled by the idols you have made. You have
brought your days to a close and have come to the end of your years.
Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mockery to
all the lands. Those near and far will mock you, O infamous city,
full of turmoil. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >See how every prince of Israel within you
has used his power to shed blood. Father and mother are treated with
contempt. Within your walls the foreign resident is exploited, the
fatherless and the widow are oppressed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You have despised My holy things and
profaned My Sabbaths. Among you are slanderous men bent on bloodshed;
within you are those who eat on the mountain shrines and commit acts
of indecency. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In you they have uncovered the nakedness
of their fathers; in you they violate women during their menstrual
impurity. One man commits an abomination with his neighbor’s wife;
another wickedly defiles his daughter-in-law; and yet another
violates his sister, his own father’s daughter. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In you they take bribes to shed blood. You
engage in usury, take excess interest, and extort your neighbors. But
Me you have forgotten, declares the Lord GOD. </font>

<font >Now look, I strike My hands together
against your unjust gain and against the blood you have shed in your
midst. Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I
deal with you? I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will act. I will
disperse you among the nations and scatter you throughout the lands;
I will purge your uncleanness. And when you have defiled yourself in
the eyes of the nations, then you will know that I am the LORD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

<font >Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me.
All of them are copper, tin, iron, and lead inside the furnace; they
are but the dross of silver. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
‘Because all of you have become dross, behold, I will gather you
into Jerusalem. Just as one gathers silver, copper, iron, lead, and
tin into the furnace to melt with a fiery blast, so I will gather you
in My anger and wrath, leave you there, and melt you. </font>

<font >Yes, I will gather you together and blow
on you with the fire of My wrath, and you will be melted within the
city. As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted within
the city. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have poured out My
wrath upon you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

fury. I have brought their ways down upon their own heads, declares
the Lord GOD.” </font>
