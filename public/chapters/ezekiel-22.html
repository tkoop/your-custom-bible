<span class="reftext">2</span>“As for you, son of man, will you judge her? Will you pass <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> on the city of bloodshed? Then confront her with all her abominations
<span class="reftext">3</span>and tell her that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘O city who brings her own doom by shedding blood within her walls and making idols to defile herself,
<span class="reftext">4</span>you are guilty of the blood you have shed, and you are defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days to a close and have come to the end of your years. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations and a mockery to all the lands.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Those near and far will mock you, O infamous city, full of turmoil.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>See how every prince of Israel within you has used his power to shed blood.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Father and mother are treated with contempt. Within your walls the foreign resident is exploited, the fatherless and the widow are oppressed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>You have despised <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> holy things and profaned <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> Sabbaths.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Among you are slanderous men bent on bloodshed; within you are those who eat on the mountain shrines and commit acts of indecency.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>In you they have uncovered the nakedness of their fathers; in you they violate women during their menstrual impurity.
<span class="reftext">11</span>One man commits an abomination with his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>’s wife; another wickedly defiles his daughter-in-law; and yet another violates his sister, his own father’s daughter.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>In you they take bribes to shed blood. You engage in usury, take excess interest, and extort your neighbors. But <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> you have forgotten, declares the Lord GOD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Now look, I strike <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> hands together against your unjust gain and against the blood you have shed in your midst.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have spoken, and I will act.
<span class="reftext">15</span>I will disperse <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> among the nations and scatter you throughout the lands; I will purge your uncleanness.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And when you have defiled yourself<span class="fn">a</span>  in the eyes of the nations, then you will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”

<span class="reftext">20</span>Just as one gathers silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin into the furnace to melt with a fiery blast, so I will gather you in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> anger and wrath, leave you there, and melt <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Yes, I will gather you together and blow on <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> with the fire of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> wrath, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be melted within the city.
<span class="reftext">22</span>As silver is melted in a furnace, so <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be melted within the city. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will know that I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have poured out <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> wrath upon <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”

They make no distinction between the holy and the common, and they fail to distinguish between the clean and the unclean. They disregard <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey, shedding blood, and destroying lives for dishonest gain.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Her prophets whitewash these deeds by false visions and lying divinations, saying, ‘This is what the Lord GOD says,’ when <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has not spoken.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>The people of the land have <span class='spell ca'>practised</span><span class='spell gb'>practised</span><span class='spell us'>practiced</span> extortion and committed robbery.
