<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Esther Pleads for Her People</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>So the king and Haman went to dine with Esther the queen,
<span class="reftext">2</span>and as they drank their wine on that second day, the king asked once more, “Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given to you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be fulfilled.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Queen Esther replied, “If I have found favour in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, grant me my life as my petition, and the lives of my people as my request.
<span class="reftext">4</span>For my people and I have been sold out to destruction, death, and annihilation. If we had merely been sold as menservants and maidservants, I would have remained silent, because no such distress would justify burdening the king.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then King Xerxes spoke up and asked Queen Esther, “Who is this, and where is the one who would devise<span class="fn">a</span>  such a scheme?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Esther replied, “The adversary and enemy is this wicked man—Haman!” </p><p class="reg1"> And Haman stood in terror before the king and queen.
</p><p class="hdg">The Hanging of Haman</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>In his fury, the king arose from drinking his wine and went to the palace garden, while Haman stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he realized that the king was planning a terrible fate for him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, “Would he actually assault the queen while I am in the palace?” </p><p class="reg1"> As soon as the words had left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said: “There is a gallows fifty cubits high<span class="fn">b</span>  at Haman’s house. He had it built for Mordecai, who gave the report that saved the king.” </p><p class="reg1">“Hang him on it!” declared the king.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the fury of the king subsided.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">whose heart has filled him to do</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">50 cubits</i> is approximately 75 feet or 22.9 meters high.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
