<font ><b>Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made
Zedekiah son of Josiah the king of Judah, and he reigned in place of
Coniah son of Jehoiakim. But he and his officers and the people of
the land refused to obey the words that the LORD had spoken through
Jeremiah the prophet. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of
Shelemiah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah
the prophet with the message, “Please pray to the LORD our God for
us!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among
the people, for they had not yet put him in prison. Pharaoh’s army
had left Egypt, and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem
heard the report, they withdrew from Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah
the prophet: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says that
you are to tell the king of Judah, who sent you to Me: Behold,
Pharaoh’s army, which has marched out to help you, will go back to
its own land of Egypt. Then the Chaldeans will return and fight
against this city. They will capture it and burn it down. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the LORD says: Do not deceive
yourselves by saying, ‘The Chaldeans will go away for good,’ for
they will not! Indeed, if you were to strike down the entire army of
the Chaldeans that is fighting against you, and only wounded men
remained in their tents, they would still get up and burn this city
down.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Chaldean army withdrew from
Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, Jeremiah started to leave
Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his portion there
among the people. But when he reached the Gate of Benjamin, the
captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son
of Hananiah, seized him and said, “You are deserting to the
Chaldeans!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >That is a lie,” Jeremiah replied. “I
am not deserting to the Chaldeans!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Irijah would not listen to him;
instead, he arrested Jeremiah and took him to the officials. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The officials were angry with Jeremiah,
and they beat him and placed him in jail in the house of Jonathan the
scribe, for it had been made into a prison. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jeremiah went into a cell in the
dungeon and remained there a long time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Later, King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and
received him in his palace, where he asked him privately, “Is there
a word from the LORD?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >There is,” Jeremiah replied. “You
will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, “How
have I sinned against you or your servants or these people, that you
have put me in prison? Where are your prophets who prophesied to you,
claiming, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or this
land’? But now please listen, O my lord the king. May my petition
come before you. Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the
scribe, or I will die there.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So King Zedekiah gave orders for Jeremiah
to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread
daily from the street of the bakers, until all the bread in the city
was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard. </font>
