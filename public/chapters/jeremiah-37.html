<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made Zedekiah son of Josiah the king of Judah, and he reigned in place of Coniah<span class="fn">a</span>  son of Jehoiakim.
<span class="reftext">2</span>But he and his officers and the people of the land refused to obey the words that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal<span class="fn">b</span>  son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet with the message, “Please pray to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God for us!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for they had not yet put him in prison.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Pharaoh’s army had left Egypt, and when the Chaldeans<span class="fn">c</span>  who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Jeremiah the prophet:
<span class="reftext">7</span>“This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are to tell the king of Judah, who sent <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>: Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has marched out to help <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, will go back to its own land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Then the Chaldeans will return and fight against this city. They will capture it and burn it down.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: Do not deceive yourselves by saying, ‘The Chaldeans will go away for good,’ for they will not!
<span class="reftext">10</span>Indeed, if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were to strike down the entire army of the Chaldeans that is fighting against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and only wounded men remained in their tents, they would still get up and burn this city down.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jeremiah Imprisoned</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>When the Chaldean army withdrew from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,
<span class="reftext">12</span>Jeremiah started to leave Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his portion there<span class="fn">d</span>  among the people.
<span class="reftext">13</span>But when he reached the <span class='cap'>Gate</span><span class='nocap'>gate</span><span class='bsb'>Gate</span> of Benjamin, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, seized him and said, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>“That is a lie,” Jeremiah replied. “I am not deserting to the Chaldeans!” </p><p class="reg1"> But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and took him to the officials.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The officials were angry with Jeremiah, and they beat him and placed him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for it had been made into a prison.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So Jeremiah went into a cell in the dungeon and remained there a long time.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Later, King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and received him in his palace, where he asked him privately, “Is there a word from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>?” </p><p class="reg1">“There is,” Jeremiah replied. “You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you or your servants or these people, that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have put me in prison?
<span class="reftext">19</span>Where are <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> prophets who prophesied to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, claiming, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> or this land’?
<span class="reftext">20</span>But now please listen, O my lord the king. May my petition come before you. Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, or I will die there.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>So King Zedekiah gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread daily from the street of the bakers, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Coniah</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jehoiachin</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Jehucal</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jucal</i>; see Jeremiah 38:1.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, the Babylonians; also in verses 8, 9, 13, and 14<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">to divide from there</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
