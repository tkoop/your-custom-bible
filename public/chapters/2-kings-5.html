<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Naaman Cured of Leprosy</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Naaman, the commander of the army of
the king of Aram, was a great man in his master’s sight and highly
regarded, for through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. And he
was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At this time the Arameans had gone out in
bands and had taken a young girl from the land of Israel, and she was
serving Naaman’s wife. She said to her mistress, “If only my
master would go to the prophet who is in Samaria, he would cure him
of his leprosy.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Naaman went and told his master what
the girl from the land of Israel had said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go now,” said the king of Aram, “and
I will send you with a letter to the king of Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Naaman departed, taking with him ten
talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of
clothing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the letter that he took to the king of
Israel stated: “With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman, so
that you may cure him of his leprosy.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the king of Israel read the letter,
he tore his clothes and asked, “Am I God, killing and giving life,
that this man expects me to cure a leper? Surely you can see that he
is seeking a quarrel with me!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when Elisha the man of God heard that
the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the
king: “Why have you torn your clothes? Please let the man come to
me, and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Naaman came with his horses and
chariots and stood at the door of Elisha’s house. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Elisha sent him a messenger, who
said, “Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your
flesh will be restored, and you will be clean.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Naaman went away angry, saying, “I
thought that he would surely come out, stand and call on the name of
the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the spot to cure my leprosy.
Are not the Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than
all the waters of Israel? Could I not have washed in them and been
cleansed?” So he turned and went away in a rage. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Naaman’s servants, however, approached
him and said, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some
great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he
tells you, ‘Wash and be cleansed’?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Naaman went down and dipped himself in
the Jordan seven times, according to the word of the man of God, and
his flesh was restored and became like that of a little child, and he
was clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Naaman and all his attendants went
back to the man of God, stood before him, and declared, “Now I know
for sure that there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. So
please accept a gift from your servant.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Elisha replied, “As surely as the
LORD lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept it.” And
although Naaman urged him to accept it, he refused. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">If you will not,” said Naaman,
“please let me, your servant, be given as much soil as a pair of
mules can carry. For your servant will never again make a burnt
offering or a sacrifice to any other god but the LORD. Yet may the
LORD forgive your servant this one thing: When my master goes into
the temple of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my arm, and I
bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant
in this matter.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go in peace,” said Elisha. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But after Naaman had traveled a short
distance, Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, “Look,
my master has spared this Aramean, Naaman, while not accepting what
he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get
something from him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Gehazi pursued Naaman. And when Naaman
saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him
and asked, “Is everything all right?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Everything is all right,” Gehazi
replied. “My master has sent me to say, ‘I have just now
discovered that two young men from the sons of the prophets have come
to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of
silver and two sets of clothing.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Naaman insisted, “Please, take two
talents.” And he urged Gehazi to accept them. Then he tied up two
talents of silver in two bags along with two sets of clothing and
gave them to two of his servants, who carried them ahead of Gehazi. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the
gifts from the servants and stored them in the house. Then he
dismissed the men, and they departed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Gehazi went in and stood before his
master, Elisha asked him, “Gehazi, where have you been?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Your servant did not go anywhere,” he
replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Elisha questioned him, “Did not my
spirit go with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet
you? Is this the time to accept money and clothing, olive groves and
vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants? Therefore,
the leprosy of Naaman will cling to you and your descendants
forever!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And as Gehazi left his presence, he was
leprous—as white as snow. </font>
