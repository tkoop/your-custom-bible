may enter the assembly of the LORD. </font>

<font >No one of illegitimate birth may enter the
assembly of the LORD, nor may any of his descendants, even to the
tenth generation. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >No Ammonite or Moabite or any of their
descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD, even to the tenth
generation. For they did not meet you with food and water on your way
out of Egypt, and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in
Aram-naharaim to curse you. Yet the LORD your God would not listen to
Balaam, and the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for
you, because the LORD your God loves you. You are not to seek peace
or prosperity from them as long as you live. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not despise an Edomite, for he is your
brother. Do not despise an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner
in his land. The third generation of children born to them may enter
the assembly of the LORD. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When you are encamped against your
enemies, then you shall keep yourself from every wicked thing. If any
man among you becomes unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he
must leave the camp and stay outside. When evening approaches, he
must wash with water, and when the sun sets he may return to the
camp. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You must have a place outside the camp to
go and relieve yourself. And you must have a digging tool in your
equipment so that when you relieve yourself you can dig a hole and
cover up your excrement. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the LORD your God walks throughout
your camp to protect you and deliver your enemies to you. Your camp
must be holy, lest He see anything unclean among you and turn away
from you. </font>

<font >Do not return a slave to his master if he
has taken refuge with you. Let him live among you wherever he
chooses, in the town of his pleasing. Do not oppress him. </font>

<font >No daughter or son of Israel is to be a

fulfill any vow, because both are detestable to the LORD your God. </font>

<font >Do not charge your brother interest on
money, food, or any other type of loan. You may charge a foreigner
interest, but not your brother, so that the LORD your God may bless
you in everything to which you put your hand in the land that you are
entering to possess. </font>

<font >If you make a vow to the LORD your God, do
not be slow to keep it, because He will surely require it of you, and
you will be guilty of sin. But if you refrain from making a vow, you
will not be guilty of sin. Be careful to follow through on what comes
from your lips, because you have freely vowed to the LORD your God
with your own mouth. </font>
