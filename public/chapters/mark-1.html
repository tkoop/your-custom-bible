</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Expels an Unclean Spirit<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 4:31–37)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then Jesus and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> companions went to Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.
<span class="reftext">22</span>The people were astonished at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> teaching, because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>But Jesus rebuked the spirit. <span>“Be silent!”</span> He said. <span>“Come out of him!”</span>
<span class="reftext">26</span>At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out with a loud shriek.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>All the people were amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>!”
<span class="reftext">28</span>And the news about Jesus spread quickly through the whole region of Galilee.

<span class="reftext">30</span>Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever, and they promptly told Jesus about her.
<span class="reftext">31</span>So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all who were sick and demon-possessed,

<span class="reftext">39</span>So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.
