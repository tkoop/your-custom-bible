<font ><b>The Mission of John the Baptist</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the beginning of the gospel of
Jesus Christ, the Son of God. As it is written in Isaiah the prophet:
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Behold, I will send My messenger ahead
of You, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >who will prepare Your way.” </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >A voice of one calling in the
wilderness, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Prepare the way for the Lord, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >make straight paths for Him.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >John the Baptist appeared in the
wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of
sins. People went out to him from all of Jerusalem and the
countryside of Judea. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by
him in the Jordan River. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >John was clothed in camel’s hair, with a
leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
And he began to proclaim: “After me will come One more powerful
than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and
untie. I baptize you with water, but He will baptize you with the
Holy Spirit.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in
Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. As soon as Jesus came
up out of the water, He saw the heavens breaking open and the Spirit
descending on Him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You
are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At once the Spirit drove Jesus into the
wilderness, and He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan.
He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After the arrest of John, Jesus went into
Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God. <font color="#a80000">“The
time is fulfilled,”</font> He said, <font color="#a80000">“and
the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of
Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net
into the sea, for they were fishermen. <font color="#a80000">“Come,
follow Me,”</font> Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“and I will
make you fishers of men.”</font> And at once they left their nets
and followed Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Going on a little farther, He saw James
son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending
their nets. Immediately Jesus called them, and they left their father
Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus and His companions went to
Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath
and began to teach. The people were astonished at His teaching,
because He taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Suddenly a man with an unclean spirit
cried out in the synagogue: “What do You want with us, Jesus of
Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy
One of God!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus rebuked the spirit. <font color="#a80000">“Be
silent!”</font> He said. <font color="#a80000">“Come out of him!”</font>
At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came
out with a loud shriek. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All the people were amazed and began to
ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He
commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!” And the news
about Jesus spread quickly through the whole region of Galilee. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As soon as Jesus and His companions had
left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of
Simon and Andrew. Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a
fever, and they promptly told Jesus about her. So He went to her,
took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she
began to serve them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That evening, after sunset, people brought
to Jesus all who were sick and demon-possessed, and the whole town
gathered at the door. And He healed many who were ill with various
diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not allow the demons
to speak, because they knew who He was. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Early in the morning, while it was still
dark, Jesus got up and slipped out to a solitary place to pray. Simon
and his companions went to look for Him, and when they found Him,
they said, “Everyone is looking for You!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“Let
us go on to the neighboring towns so I can preach there as well, for
that is why I have come.”</font> So He went throughout Galilee,
preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a leper came to Jesus, begging on his
knees: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out
His hand and touched the man. <font color="#a80000">“I am willing,”</font>
He said. <font color="#a80000">“Be clean!”</font> And immediately
the leprosy left him, and the man was cleansed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus promptly sent him away with a stern
warning: <font color="#a80000">“See that you don’t tell anyone.
But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses
prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the man went out and openly began to
proclaim and spread the news. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter
a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet
people came to Him from every quarter. </font>
