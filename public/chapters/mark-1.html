<span class="reftext">2</span>As it is written in Isaiah the prophet:<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent1stline">“Behold, I will send My messenger ahead of You, </p><p class="indent"> who will prepare Your way.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>“A voice of one calling in the wilderness, </p><p class="indent">‘Prepare the way for the Lord, </p><p class="indent"> make straight paths for Him.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
<span class="reftext">5</span>People went out to him from all of Jerusalem and the countryside of Judea. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>John was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And he began to proclaim: “After me will come One more powerful than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
<span class="reftext">8</span>I baptize you with water,<span class="fn">e</span>  but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.<span class="fn">f</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
<span class="reftext">10</span>As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, He saw<span class="fn">g</span>  the heavens breaking open and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Temptation and Preaching of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 4:1–17; Luke 4:1–15)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>At once the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness,
<span class="reftext">13</span>and He was there for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels ministered to Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>After the arrest of John, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God.<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span><span>“The time is fulfilled,”</span> He said, <span>“and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The First Disciples<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 4:18–22; Luke 5:1–11; John 1:35–42)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
<span><span class="reftext">17</span>“Come, follow Me,”</span> Jesus said, <span>“and I will make you fishers of men.”</span>
<span class="reftext">18</span>And at once they left their nets and followed Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Going on a little farther, He saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat, mending their nets.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Immediately Jesus called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed Him.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Expels an Unclean Spirit<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 4:31–37)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then Jesus and His companions went to Capernaum, and right away Jesus entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and began to teach.
<span class="reftext">22</span>The people were astonished at His teaching, because He taught as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Suddenly a man with an unclean spirit cried out in the synagogue:
<span class="reftext">24</span>“What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>But Jesus rebuked the spirit. <span>“Be silent!”</span> He said. <span>“Come out of him!”</span>
<span class="reftext">26</span>At this, the unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and came out with a loud shriek.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>All the people were amazed and began to ask one another, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!”
<span class="reftext">28</span>And the news about Jesus spread quickly through the whole region of Galilee.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals at Peter’s House<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 8:14–17; Luke 4:38–41)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>As soon as Jesus and His companions had left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever, and they promptly told Jesus about her.
<span class="reftext">31</span>So He went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>That evening, after sunset, people brought to Jesus all who were sick and demon-possessed,
<span class="reftext">33</span>and the whole town gathered at the door.
<span class="reftext">34</span>And He healed many who were ill with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Prays and Preaches<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 4:42–44)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up and slipped out to a solitary place to pray.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Simon and his companions went to look for Him,
<span class="reftext">37</span>and when they found Him, they said, “Everyone is looking for You!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>But Jesus answered, <span>“Let us go on to the neighboring towns so I can preach there as well, for that is why I have come.”</span>
<span class="reftext">39</span>So He went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.
</p><p class="hdg">The Leper’s Prayer<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Leviticus 14:1–32; Matthew 8:1–4; Luke 5:12–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Then a leper<span class="fn">i</span>  came to Jesus, begging on his knees: “If You are willing, You can make me clean.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>Moved with compassion,<span class="fn">j</span>  Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. <span>“I am willing,”</span> He said. <span>“Be clean!”</span>
<span class="reftext">42</span>And immediately the leprosy left him, and the man was cleansed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>Jesus promptly sent him away with a stern warning:
<span class="reftext">44</span><span>“See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering Moses prescribed for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”<span class="fn">k</span> </span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>But the man went out and openly began to proclaim and spread the news. </p><p class="reg1"> Consequently, Jesus could no longer enter a town in plain view, but He stayed out in solitary places. Yet people came to Him from every quarter.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> SBL and WH <i class="calibre6">the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">in the prophets:</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Malachi 3:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Isaiah 40:3 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in water</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the Holy Spirit</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">he saw</i>; see John 1:32–33<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">the gospel of the kingdom of God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">40</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> A <i class="calibre6">leper</i> was one afflicted with a skin disease.
