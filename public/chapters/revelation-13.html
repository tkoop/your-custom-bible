There were ten royal crowns on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads.
<span class="reftext">2</span>The beast I saw was like a leopard, with the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>One of the heads of the beast appeared to be mortally wounded. But the mortal wound was healed, and the whole world <span class='spell ca'>marvelled</span><span class='spell gb'>marvelled</span><span class='spell us'>marveled</span> and followed the beast.
<span class="reftext">4</span>They worshiped the dragon who had given authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can wage war against it?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The beast was given a mouth to speak arrogant and blasphemous words, and authority to act for 42 months.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the beast opened its mouth to speak blasphemies against God and to slander <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> name and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> tabernacle—those who dwell in heaven.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then the beast was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them, and it was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And all who dwell on the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of <span class='cap'>Life</span><span class='nocap'>life</span> belonging to the Lamb who was slain.<span class="fn">a</span>

</p><p class="hdg">The Beast from the Earth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. This beast had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And this beast exercised all the authority of the first beast and caused the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose mortal wound had been healed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And the second beast performed great signs to cause even fire from heaven to come down to earth in the presence of the people.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Because of the signs it was given to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived those who dwell on the earth, telling them to make an image to the beast that had been wounded by the sword and yet had lived.
<span class="reftext">15</span>The second beast was permitted to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship it to be killed.
</p><p class="hdg">The Mark of the Beast</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And the second beast required all people small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,
<span class="reftext">17</span>so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark—the name of the beast or the number of its name.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and that number is 666.<span class="fn">d</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">written in the Book of Life belonging to the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> NE, WH, and BYZ <i class="calibre6">if anyone kills</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> See Jeremiah 15:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Some manuscripts <i class="calibre6">616</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
