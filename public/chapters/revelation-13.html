<font ><b>The Beasts from the Sea and Earth</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I saw a beast with ten horns and
seven heads rising out of the sea. There were ten royal crowns on its
horns and blasphemous names on its heads. The beast I saw was like a
leopard, with the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion. And the
dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One of the heads of the beast appeared to
be mortally wounded. But the mortal wound was healed, and the whole
world marveled and followed the beast. They worshiped the dragon who
had given authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast,
saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can wage war against it?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The beast was given a mouth to speak
arrogant and blasphemous words, and authority to act for 42 months.
And the beast opened its mouth to speak blasphemies against God and
to slander His name and His tabernacle—those who dwell in heaven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the beast was permitted to wage war
against the saints and to conquer them, and it was given authority
over every tribe and people and tongue and nation. And all who dwell
on the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been
written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life
belonging to the Lamb who was slain. </font>

<font >Here is a call for the perseverance and

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I saw another beast rising out of the
earth. This beast had two horns like a lamb, but spoke like a dragon.
And this beast exercised all the authority of the first beast and
caused the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first
beast, whose mortal wound had been healed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the second beast performed great signs
to cause even fire from heaven to come down to earth in the presence
of the people. Because of the signs it was given to perform on behalf
of the first beast, it deceived those who dwell on the earth, telling
them to make an image to the beast that had been wounded by the sword
and yet had lived. The second beast was permitted to give breath to
the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause
all who refused to worship it to be killed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the second beast required all people
small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on
their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one could buy or
sell unless he had the mark—the name of the beast or the number of
its name. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Here is a call for wisdom: Let the one who
has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number
of a man, and that number is 666. </font>
