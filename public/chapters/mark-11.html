<span class="reftext">2</span>and said to them, <span>“Go into the village ahead of you, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.
<span class="reftext">3</span>If anyone asks, ‘Why are you doing this?’ tell him, ‘The Lord needs it and will return it shortly.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So they went and found the colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. They untied it,
<span class="reftext">5</span>and some who were standing there asked, “Why are you untying the colt?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>The disciples answered as Jesus had instructed them, and the people gave them permission.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then they led the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, and He sat on it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Many in the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut from the fields.
<span class="reftext">9</span>The ones who went ahead and those who followed were shouting: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Hosanna!”<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent1stline">“Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>“Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!” </p><p class="indent1stline">“Hosanna in the highest!”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts.<span class="fn">d</span>  He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, He went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Curses the Fig Tree<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 21:18–22; Mark 11:20–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>The next day, when they had left Bethany, Jesus was hungry.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if there was any fruit on it. But when He reached it, He found nothing on it except leaves, since it was not the season for figs.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Then He said to the tree, <span>“May no one ever eat of your fruit again.”</span> And His disciples heard this statement.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Cleanses the Temple<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 21:12–17; Luke 19:45–48; John 2:12–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>When they arrived in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And He would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Then Jesus began to teach them, and He declared, <span>“Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’<span class="fn">e</span>? But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’<span class="fn">f</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>When the chief priests and scribes heard this, they looked for a way to kill Him. For they were afraid of Him, because the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And when evening came, Jesus and His disciples went<span class="fn">g</span>  out of the city.
</p><p class="hdg">The Withered Fig Tree<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 21:18–22; Mark 11:12–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>As they were walking back in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from its roots.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Peter remembered it and said, “Look, Rabbi! The fig tree You cursed has withered.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">22</span>“Have faith in God,”</span> Jesus said to them.
<span><span class="reftext">23</span>“Truly I tell you that if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and has no doubt in his heart but believes that it will happen, it will be done for him.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">25</span>And when you stand to pray, if you hold anything against another, forgive it, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your trespasses as well.<span class="fn">h</span>”

</p><p class="hdg">Jesus’ Authority Challenged<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 21:23–27; Luke 20:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>After their return to Jerusalem, Jesus was walking in the temple courts, and the chief priests, scribes, and elders came up to Him.
<span class="reftext">28</span>“By what authority are You doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave You the authority to do them?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">29</span>“I will ask you one question,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“and if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
<span class="reftext">30</span>John’s baptism—was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me!”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>They deliberated among themselves what they should answer: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
<span class="reftext">32</span>But if we say, ‘From men’...” they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John truly was a prophet.
<span class="reftext">33</span>So they answered, “We do not know.” </p><p class="reg1"> And Jesus replied, <span>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</span></p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Hosanna</i> is a transliteration of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Hosia-na</i>, meaning <i class="calibre6">Save, we pray</i> or <i class="calibre6">Save now</i>, which became a shout of praise; see Psalm 118:25.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Psalm 118:26<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">“Hosanna in the highest heaven!”</i> See Psalm 118:25 and Psalm 148:1.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i>; also in verses 15, 16, and 27<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Isaiah 56:7<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Jeremiah 7:11<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">they went</i>; BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">He went</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6"><span class="fnv">26</span>But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses</i>; see Matthew 6:15.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
