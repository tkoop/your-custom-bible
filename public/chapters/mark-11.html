<font >As they approached Jerusalem and came to
Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent out two of
His disciples and said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Go into the
village ahead of you, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a
colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it
here. If anyone asks, ‘Why are you doing this?’ tell him, ‘The
Lord needs it and will return it shortly.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font color="#880000"> </font></font><font color="#a80000">”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So they went and found the colt outside in
the street, tied at a doorway. They untied it, and some who were
standing there asked, “Why are you untying the colt?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The disciples answered as Jesus had
instructed them, and the people gave them permission. Then they led
the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, and He sat on it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Many in the crowd spread their cloaks on
the road, while others spread branches they had cut from the fields.
The ones who went ahead and those who followed were shouting: </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >Blessed is He who comes in the name of
the Lord!” </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into
the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was
already late, He went out to Bethany with the Twelve. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The next day, when they had left Bethany,
Jesus was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, He went
to see if there was any fruit on it. But when He reached it, He found
nothing on it except leaves, since it was not the season for figs.
Then He said to the tree, <font color="#a80000">“May no one ever
eat of your fruit again.”</font> And His disciples heard this
statement. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When they arrived in Jerusalem, Jesus
entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were
buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money
changers and the seats of those selling doves. And He would not allow
anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. Then Jesus
began to teach them, and He declared, <font color="#a80000">“Is it
not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the
nations’? But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When the chief priests and scribes heard
this, they looked for a way to kill Him. For they were afraid of Him,
because the whole crowd was astonished at His teaching. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And when evening came, Jesus and His
disciples went out of the city. </font>

<font >As they were walking back in the morning,
they saw the fig tree withered from its roots. Peter remembered it
and said, “Look, Rabbi! The fig tree You cursed has withered.” </font>

<font color="#a80000">“<font >Have faith in
God,”</font> Jesus said to them. <font color="#a80000">“Truly I
tell you that if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and
thrown into the sea,’ and has no doubt in his heart but believes
that it will happen, it will be done for him. Therefore I tell you,
whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it,
and it will be yours.</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >And when you stand
to pray, if you hold anything against another, forgive it, so that
your Father in heaven will forgive your trespasses as well.” </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >After their return to Jerusalem, Jesus was
walking in the temple courts, and the chief priests, scribes, and
elders came up to Him. “By what authority are You doing these
things?” they asked. “And who gave You the authority to do them?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >I will ask you
one question,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“and
if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these
things. John’s baptism—was it from heaven or from men? Answer
Me!”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >They deliberated among themselves what
they should answer: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask,
‘Why then did you not believe him?’ But if we say, ‘From
men’...” they were afraid of the people, for they all held that
John truly was a prophet. So they answered, “We do not know.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Neither
will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</font> </font>
