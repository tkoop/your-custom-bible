<font >These were the sons of Reuben the
firstborn of Israel. Though he was the firstborn, his birthright was
given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel, because Reuben defiled his
father’s bed. So he is not reckoned according to birthright. And
though Judah prevailed over his brothers and a ruler came from him,
the birthright belonged to Joseph. The sons of Reuben, the firstborn
of Israel: </font>

<font >Jeiel the chief, Zechariah, and Bela son
of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel. They settled in Aroer and
as far as Nebo and Baal-meon. They also settled in the east as far as
the edge of the desert that extends to the Euphrates River, because
their livestock had increased in the land of Gilead. </font>

Gilead. </font>

<font >The descendants of Gad lived next to the

<font >Their kinsmen by families were Michael,
Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber—seven in all. These
were the sons of Abihail son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of
Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo,
the son of Buz. Ahi son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, was head of their

<font >They lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its

<font >The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the
half-tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 warriors—valiant men who carried
the shield and sword, drew the bow, and were trained for battle. They
waged war against the Hagrites, as well as Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.4cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >And because they cried out to God in
battle, they were helped against their enemies, and the Hagrites and
all their allies were delivered into their hands. Because they put
their trust in God, He answered their prayers. They seized the
livestock of the Hagrites—50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000
donkeys. They also took 100,000 captives, and many others fell slain,
because the battle belonged to God. And they occupied the land until
the exile. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the people of the half-tribe of
Manasseh were numerous. They settled in the land from Bashan to
Baal-hermon (that is, Senir, also known as Mount Hermon). These were
the heads of their families: </font>

<font >They were mighty men of valor, famous men,
and heads of their families. But they were unfaithful to the God of
their fathers, and they prostituted themselves with the gods of the
peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.4cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit
of Pul king of Assyria (that is, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria) to
take the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into
exile. And he brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of
Gozan, where they remain to this day. </font>
