<font >Before the year that the chief commander,
sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and
captured it, the LORD had already spoken through Isaiah son of Amoz,
saying, “Go, remove the sackcloth from your waist and the sandals
from your feet.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Isaiah did so, walking around naked
and barefoot. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said, “Just as My servant
Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and omen
against Egypt and Cush, so the king of Assyria will lead away the
captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old alike, naked
and barefoot, with bared buttocks—to Egypt’s shame. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Those who made Cush their hope and Egypt
their boast will be dismayed and ashamed. And on that day the
dwellers of this coastland will say, ‘See what has happened to our
source of hope, those to whom we fled for help and deliverance from
the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
