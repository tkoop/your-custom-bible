<span class="reftext">2</span>“Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak,<span class="fn">a</span>  the high priest, and also to the remnant of the people. Ask them,
<span class="reftext">3</span>‘Who is left among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> who saw this house in its former glory?

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>But now be strong, O Zerubbabel, </p><p class="indent"> declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. </p><p class="indent1"> Be strong, O Joshua son of Jehozadak, </p><p class="indent"> the high priest. </p><p class="indent1"> And be strong, all you people of the land, </p><p class="indent"> declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. </p><p class="indent1"> Work!

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>This is the promise I made to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> </p><p class="indent"> when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> came out of Egypt. </p><p class="indent1"> And <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> remains among you; </p><p class="indent"> do not be afraid.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Once more, in a little while, </p><p class="indent"> I will shake the heavens and the earth,<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> the sea and the dry land.

</p><p class="hdg">Blessings for a Defiled People</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Haggai the prophet, saying,
<span class="reftext">11</span>“This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: ‘Ask the priests for a ruling.
<span class="reftext">12</span>If a man carries consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and it touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food, does that item become holy?’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1">“No,” replied the priests.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Haggai asked, “If one who is defiled by contact with a corpse touches any of these, does it become defiled?” </p><p class="reg1">“Yes, it becomes defiled,” the priests answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then Haggai replied, “So it is with this people and this nation before <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and so it is with every work of their hands; whatever they offer there is defiled.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now consider carefully from this day forward:<span class="fn">c</span>  Before one stone was placed on another in the temple of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,
<span class="reftext">16</span>from that time, when one came expecting a heap of twenty ephahs of grain,<span class="fn">d</span>  there were but ten. When one came to the winepress to draw out fifty baths,<span class="fn">e</span>  there were but twenty.
<span class="reftext">17</span>I struck you—all the work of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hands—with blight, mildew, and hail, but <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> did not turn to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Consider carefully from this day forward—from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, the day the foundation of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s temple was laid—consider carefully:
<span class="reftext">19</span>Is there still seed in the barn? The vine, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yet yielded fruit. But from this day on, I will bless you.”
