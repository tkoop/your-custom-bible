<font ><b>Moses at the Burning Bush</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock
of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock
to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of
God. There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire
from within a bush. Moses saw the bush ablaze with fire, but it was
not consumed. So Moses thought, “I must go over and see this
marvelous sight. Why is the bush not burning up?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the LORD saw that he had gone over to
look, God called out to him from within the bush, “Moses, Moses!”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Here I am,” he answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Do not come any closer,” God said.
“Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is
holy ground.” Then He said, “I am the God of your father, the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, Moses hid his face, for he was
afraid to look at God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the
affliction of My people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out
because of their oppressors, and I am aware of their sufferings. I
have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to
bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land
flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites,
Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now the cry of the Israelites has
reached Me, and I have seen how severely the Egyptians are oppressing
them. Therefore, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring My people
the Israelites out of Egypt.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Moses asked God, “Who am I, that I
should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I will surely be with you,” God said,
“and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: When you
have brought the people out of Egypt, all of you will worship God on
this mountain.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses asked God, “Suppose I go to
the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent
me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ What should I
tell them?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This
is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to
you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >God also told Moses, “Say to the
Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to
you.’ This is My name forever, and this is how I am to be
remembered in every generation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say
to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob—has appeared to me and said: I have surely
attended to you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt. And
I have promised to bring you up out of your affliction in Egypt, into
the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites,
and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The elders of Israel will listen to what
you say, and you must go with them to the king of Egypt and tell him,
‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let
us take a three-day journey into the wilderness, so that we may
sacrifice to the LORD our God.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But I know that the king of Egypt will not
allow you to go unless a mighty hand compels him. So I will stretch
out My hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders I will
perform among them. And after that, he will release you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And I will grant this people such favor in
the sight of the Egyptians that when you leave, you will not go away
empty-handed. Every woman shall ask her neighbor and any woman
staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing, and
you will put them on your sons and daughters. So you will plunder the
Egyptians.” </font>
