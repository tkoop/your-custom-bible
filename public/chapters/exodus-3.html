<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock
of his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the flock
to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of
God. There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire
from within a bush. Moses saw the bush ablaze with fire, but it was
not consumed. So Moses thought, “I must go over and see this
marvelous sight. Why is the bush not burning up?” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the LORD saw that he had gone over to
look, God called out to him from within the bush, “Moses, Moses!”

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not come any closer,” God said.
“Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is
holy ground.” Then He said, “I am the God of your father, the God
of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At this, Moses hid his face, for he was

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the
affliction of My people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out
because of their oppressors, and I am aware of their sufferings. I
have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to
bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land
flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites,
Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And now the cry of the Israelites has
reached Me, and I have seen how severely the Egyptians are oppressing
them. Therefore, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring My people
the Israelites out of Egypt.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Moses asked God, “Who am I, that I

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will surely be with you,” God said,

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Moses asked God, “Suppose I go to
the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent
me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ What should I
tell them?” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">God also told Moses, “Say to the

remembered in every generation. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say
to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob—has appeared to me and said: I have surely
attended to you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt. And
I have promised to bring you up out of your affliction in Egypt, into
the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites,

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The elders of Israel will listen to what
you say, and you must go with them to the king of Egypt and tell him,
‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let
us take a three-day journey into the wilderness, so that we may
sacrifice to the LORD our God.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But I know that the king of Egypt will not
allow you to go unless a mighty hand compels him. So I will stretch
out My hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders I will

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And I will grant this people such favor in
the sight of the Egyptians that when you leave, you will not go away
empty-handed. Every woman shall ask her neighbor and any woman
staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry and clothing, and
you will put them on your sons and daughters. So you will plunder the
Egyptians.” </font>
