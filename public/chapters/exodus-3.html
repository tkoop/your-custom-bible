<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Moses at the Burning Bush<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 7:30–38)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro,<span class="fn">a</span>  the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb,<span class="fn">b</span>  the mountain of God.
<span class="reftext">2</span>There the angel<span class="fn">c</span>  of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> appeared to him in a blazing fire from within a bush. Moses saw the bush ablaze with fire, but it was not consumed.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So Moses thought, “I must go over and see this <span class='spell ca'>marvellous</span><span class='spell gb'>marvellous</span><span class='spell us'>marvelous</span> sight. Why is the bush not burning up?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> saw that he had gone over to look, God called out to him from within the bush, “Moses, Moses!” </p><p class="reg1">“Here I am,” he answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>“Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”<span class="fn">e</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> At this, Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> said, “I have indeed seen the affliction of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their oppressors, and I am aware of their sufferings.
<span class="reftext">8</span>I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And now the cry of the Israelites has reached <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, and I have seen how severely the Egyptians are oppressing them.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore, go! I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people the Israelites out of Egypt.”<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But Moses asked God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“I will surely be with you,” God said, “and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, all of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will worship God on this mountain.”<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then Moses asked God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers has sent me to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>,’ and they ask me, ‘What is <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> name?’ What should I tell them?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.<span class="fn">h</span>  This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>God also told Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span>, the God of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.’ This is <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span>, the God of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—has appeared to me and said: I have surely attended to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and have seen what has been done to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in Egypt.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And I have promised to bring you up out of your affliction in Egypt, into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>The elders of Israel will listen to what you say, and you must go with them to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span>, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>But I know that the king of Egypt will not allow <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to go unless a mighty hand compels him.<span class="fn">i</span> 
<span class="reftext">20</span>So I will stretch out <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders I will perform among them. And after that, he will release <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>And I will grant this people such <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in the sight of the Egyptians that when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> leave, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will not go away empty-handed.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Every woman shall ask her <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold <span class='spell ca'>jewellery</span><span class='spell gb'>jewellery</span><span class='spell us'>jewelry</span> and clothing, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will put them on <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sons and daughters. So <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will plunder the Egyptians.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Moses’ father-in-law <i class="calibre6">Jethro</i> was also called <i class="calibre6">Reuel</i>; see Exodus 2:18.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, Mount Sinai, or possibly a mountain in the range containing Mount Sinai<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Cited in Acts 7:33<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Cited in Matthew 22:32, Mark 12:26, Luke 20:37, and Acts 7:32<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Cited in Acts 7:34<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Cited in Acts 7:7<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">except by a mighty hand</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
