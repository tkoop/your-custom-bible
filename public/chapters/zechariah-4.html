<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Vision of the Lampstand and Olive Trees</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and woke me, as a man is awakened from his sleep.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“What do you see?” he asked. </p><p class="reg1">“I see a solid gold lampstand,” I replied, “with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven spouts to the lamps.
<span class="reftext">3</span>There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“What are these, my lord?” I asked the angel who was speaking with me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>“Do you not know what they are?” replied the angel. </p><p class="reg1">“No, my lord,” I answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So he said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the LORD of Hosts.
<span class="reftext">7</span>What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. Then he will bring forth the capstone accompanied by shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">9</span>“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent me to you.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven eyes<span class="fn">a</span>  of the LORD, which scan the whole earth, will rejoice when they see the plumb line<span class="fn">b</span>  in the hand of Zerubbabel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then I asked the angel, “What are the two olive trees on the right and left of the lampstand?”
<span class="reftext">12</span>And I questioned him further, “What are the two olive branches beside the two gold pipes from which the golden oil<span class="fn">c</span>  pours?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>“Do you not know what these are?” he inquired. </p><p class="reg1">“No, my lord,” I replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So he said, “These are the two anointed ones<span class="fn">d</span>  who are standing beside the Lord of all the earth.”<span class="fn">e</span> </p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">facets</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the chosen capstone</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">from which the gold</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the two sons of new oil</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> See Revelation 11:4.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
