<font >As a fellow elder, a witness of Christ’s
sufferings, and a partaker of the glory to be revealed, I appeal to
the elders among you: Be shepherds of God’s flock that is among
you, watching over them not out of compulsion, but because it is
God’s will; not out of greed, but out of eagerness; not lording it
over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. And
when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory
that will never fade away. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Young men, in the same way, submit
yourselves to your elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with
humility toward one another, because, </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s
mighty hand, so that in due time He may exalt you. Cast all your
anxiety on Him, because He cares for you. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Be sober-minded and alert. Your adversary
the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to
devour. Resist him, standing firm in your faith and in the knowledge
that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds
of suffering. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And after you have suffered for a little
while, the God of all grace, who has called you to His eternal glory
in Christ, will Himself restore you, secure you, strengthen you, and
establish you. To Him be the power forever and ever. Amen. </font>

faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and
