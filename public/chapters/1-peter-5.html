<span class="reftext">2</span>Be shepherds of God’s flock that is among you, watching over them<span class="fn">b</span>  not out of compulsion, but because it is God’s will;<span class="fn">c</span>  not out of greed, but out of eagerness;
<span class="reftext">3</span>not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.
</p><p class="hdg">Cast Your Cares on Him</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Young men, in the same way, submit yourselves to your elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, </p><p class="indent1stline">“God opposes the proud, </p><p class="indent"> but gives grace to the humble.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, so that in due time He may exalt you.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Cast all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Be sober-minded and alert. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Resist him, standing firm in your faith and in the knowledge that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering.
</p><p class="hdg">Benediction and Farewell</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to His eternal glory in Christ,<span class="fn">e</span>  will Himself restore you, secure you, strengthen you, and establish you.
<span class="reftext">11</span>To Him be the power forever and ever. Amen.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Through Silvanus,<span class="fn">f</span>  whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>The church in Babylon,<span class="fn">g</span>  chosen together with you, sends you greetings, as does my son Mark.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Greet one another with a kiss of love. </p><p class="reg1"> Peace to all of you who are in Christ.<span class="fn">h</span> </p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> SBL, NE, and WH <i class="calibre6">I appeal therefore to the elders</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> NE and WH do not include <i class="calibre6">watching over them</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> WH, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">but willingly</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Proverbs 3:34 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">in Christ Jesus</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> That is, Silas<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">She in Babylon</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">Amen.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
