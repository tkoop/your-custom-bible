<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Guilt Offering<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Leviticus 5:14–19; Leviticus 6:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>“Now this is the law of the guilt offering, which is most holy:
<span class="reftext">2</span>The guilt offering must be slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, and the priest shall sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And all the fat from it shall be offered: the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails,
<span class="reftext">4</span>both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys.
<span class="reftext">5</span>The priest shall burn them on the altar as an offering made by fire to the LORD; it is a guilt offering.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Every male among the priests may eat of it. It must be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>The guilt offering is like the sin offering; the same law applies to both. It belongs to the priest who makes atonement with it.
<span class="reftext">8</span>As for the priest who presents a burnt offering for anyone, the hide of that offering belongs to him.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in an oven or cooked in a pan<span class="fn">a</span>  or on a griddle<span class="fn">b</span>  belongs to the priest who presents it,
<span class="reftext">10</span>and every grain offering, whether dry or mixed with oil, belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron.
</p><p class="hdg">The Peace Offering<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Leviticus 3:1–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now this is the law of the peace offering that one may present to the LORD:
<span class="reftext">12</span>If he offers it in thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with olive oil, unleavened wafers coated with oil, and well-kneaded cakes of fine flour mixed with oil.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Along with his peace offering of thanksgiving he is to present an offering with cakes of leavened bread.
<span class="reftext">14</span>From the cakes he must present one portion of each offering as a contribution to the LORD. It belongs to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering.
<span class="reftext">15</span>The meat of the sacrifice of his peace offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the day he offers it; none of it may be left until morning.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>If, however, the sacrifice he offers is a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day he presents his sacrifice, but the remainder may be eaten on the next day.
<span class="reftext">17</span>But any meat of the sacrifice remaining until the third day must be burned up.
<span class="reftext">18</span>If any of the meat from his peace offering is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted. It will not be credited to the one who presented it; it shall be an abomination, and the one who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Meat that touches anything unclean must not be eaten; it is to be burned up. As for any other meat, anyone who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
<span class="reftext">20</span>But if anyone who is unclean eats meat from the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people.
<span class="reftext">21</span>If one touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any unclean, detestable thing, and then eats any of the meat of the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people.”
</p><p class="hdg">Fat and Blood Forbidden</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then the LORD said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">23</span>“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘You are not to eat any of the fat of an ox, a sheep, or a goat.
<span class="reftext">24</span>The fat of an animal found dead or mauled by wild beasts may be used for any other purpose, but you must not eat it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>If anyone eats the fat of an animal from which an offering made by fire may be presented to the LORD, the one who eats it must be cut off from his people.
<span class="reftext">26</span>You must not eat the blood of any bird or animal in any of your dwellings.
<span class="reftext">27</span>If anyone eats blood, that person must be cut off from his people.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Priests’ Portion</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then the LORD said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">29</span>“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘Anyone who presents a peace offering to the LORD must bring it as his sacrifice to the LORD.
<span class="reftext">30</span>With his own hands he is to bring the offerings made by fire to the LORD; he shall bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast as a wave offering before the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>The priest is to burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons.
<span class="reftext">32</span>And you are to give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from your peace offering.
<span class="reftext">33</span>The son of Aaron who presents the blood and fat of the peace offering shall have the right thigh as a portion.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>I have taken from the sons of Israel the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution of their peace offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a permanent portion from the sons of Israel.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>This is the portion of the offerings made by fire to the LORD for Aaron and his sons since the day they were presented to serve the LORD as priests.
<span class="reftext">36</span>On the day they were anointed, the LORD commanded that this be given them by the sons of Israel. It is a permanent portion for the generations to come.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering, and the peace offering,
<span class="reftext">38</span>which the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai on the day He commanded the Israelites to present their offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, a deep pan or stew pan<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, a shallow pan for baking or frying<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
