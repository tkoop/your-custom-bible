<font ><b>The Priests’ Portion</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Now this is the law of the guilt
offering, which is most holy: The guilt offering must be slaughtered
in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, and the priest
shall sprinkle its blood on all sides of the altar. And all the fat
from it shall be offered: the fat tail, the fat that covers the
entrails, both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the
lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys. The
priest shall burn them on the altar as an offering made by fire to
the LORD; it is a guilt offering. Every male among the priests may
eat of it. It must be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The guilt offering is like the sin
offering; the same law applies to both. It belongs to the priest who
makes atonement with it. As for the priest who presents a burnt
offering for anyone, the hide of that offering belongs to him.
Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in an oven or cooked in
a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who presents it, and
every grain offering, whether dry or mixed with oil, belongs equally
to all the sons of Aaron. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now this is the law of the peace offering
that one may present to the LORD: If he offers it in thanksgiving,
then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer
unleavened cakes mixed with olive oil, unleavened wafers coated with
oil, and well-kneaded cakes of fine flour mixed with oil. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Along with his peace offering of
thanksgiving he is to present an offering with cakes of leavened
bread. From the cakes he must present one portion of each offering as
a contribution to the LORD. It belongs to the priest who sprinkles
the blood of the peace offering. The meat of the sacrifice of his
peace offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the day he offers it;
none of it may be left until morning. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If, however, the sacrifice he offers is a
vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day he presents
his sacrifice, but the remainder may be eaten on the next day. But
any meat of the sacrifice remaining until the third day must be
burned up. If any of the meat from his peace offering is eaten on the
third day, it will not be accepted. It will not be credited to the
one who presented it; it shall be an abomination, and the one who
eats of it shall bear his iniquity. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meat that touches anything unclean must
not be eaten; it is to be burned up. As for any other meat, anyone
who is ceremonially clean may eat it. But if anyone who is unclean
eats meat from the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that
person must be cut off from his people. If one touches anything
unclean, whether human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any
unclean, detestable thing, and then eats any of the meat of the peace
offering that belongs to the LORD, that person must be cut off from
his people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
the Israelites and say, ‘You are not to eat any of the fat of an
ox, a sheep, or a goat. The fat of an animal found dead or mauled by
wild beasts may be used for any other purpose, but you must not eat
it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If anyone eats the fat of an animal from
which an offering made by fire may be presented to the LORD, the one
who eats it must be cut off from his people. You must not eat the
blood of any bird or animal in any of your dwellings. If anyone eats
blood, that person must be cut off from his people.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
the Israelites and say, ‘Anyone who presents a peace offering to
the LORD must bring it as his sacrifice to the LORD. With his own
hands he is to bring the offerings made by fire to the LORD; he shall
bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast as a
wave offering before the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The priest is to burn the fat on the
altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons. And you are to
give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from your peace
offering. The son of Aaron who presents the blood and fat of the
peace offering shall have the right thigh as a portion. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I have taken from the sons of Israel the
breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution of
their peace offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and
his sons as a permanent portion from the sons of Israel.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the portion of the offerings made
by fire to the LORD for Aaron and his sons since the day they were
presented to serve the LORD as priests. On the day they were
anointed, the LORD commanded that this be given them by the sons of
Israel. It is a permanent portion for the generations to come. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the law of the burnt offering, the
grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination
offering, and the peace offering, which the LORD gave Moses on Mount
Sinai on the day He commanded the Israelites to present their
offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai. </font>
