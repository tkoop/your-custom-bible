“<font face="Tahoma, serif">As for you, O son of man, prophesy
against Gog and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold,
I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. I will
turn you around, drive you along, bring you up from the far north,
and send you against the mountains of Israel. Then I will strike the
bow from your left hand and dash down the arrows from your right
hand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the mountains of Israel you will
fall—you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give
you as food to every kind of ravenous bird and wild beast. You will
fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will send fire on Magog and on those who
dwell securely in the coastlands, and they will know that I am the
LORD. So I will make My holy name known among My people Israel and
will no longer allow it to be profaned. Then the nations will know
that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel. Yes, it is coming, and it
will surely happen, declares the Lord GOD. This is the day of which I
have spoken. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then those who dwell in the cities of
Israel will go out, kindle fires, and burn up the weapons—the
bucklers and shields, the bows and arrows, the clubs and spears. For
seven years they will use them for fuel. They will not gather wood
from the countryside or cut it from the forests, for they will use
the weapons for fuel. They will loot those who looted them and
plunder those who plundered them, declares the Lord GOD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And on that day I will give Gog a burial
place in Israel, the Valley of the Travelers, east of the Sea. It
will block those who travel through, because Gog and all his hordes
will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog.
For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to
cleanse the land. All the people of the land will bury them, and it
will bring them renown on the day I display My glory, declares the
Lord GOD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And men will be employed to continually
pass through the land to cleanse it by burying the invaders who
remain on the ground. At the end of the seven months they will begin
their search. As they pass through the land, anyone who sees a human
bone will set up a pillar next to it, until the gravediggers have
buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog. (Even the city will be named
Hamonah.) And so they will cleanse the land. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And as for you, son of man, this is what
the Lord GOD says: Call out to every kind of bird and to every beast
of the field: ‘Assemble and come together from all around to the
sacrificial feast that I am preparing for you, a great feast on the
mountains of Israel. There you will eat flesh and drink blood. You
will eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes
of the earth as though they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls—all
the fattened animals of Bashan. At the sacrifice I am preparing, you
will eat fat until you are gorged and drink blood until you are
drunk. And at My table you will eat your fill of horses and riders,
of mighty men and warriors of every kind,’ declares the Lord GOD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will display My glory among the nations,
and all the nations will see the judgment that I execute and the hand
that I lay upon them. From that day forward the house of Israel will
know that I am the LORD their God. And the nations will know that the
house of Israel went into exile for their iniquity, because they were
unfaithful to Me. So I hid My face from them and delivered them into
the hands of their enemies, so that they all fell by the sword. I
dealt with them according to their uncleanness and transgressions,
and I hid My face from them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
Now I will restore Jacob from captivity and will have compassion on
the whole house of Israel, and I will be jealous for My holy name.
They will forget their disgrace and all the treachery they committed
against Me, when they dwell securely in their land, with no one to
frighten them. When I bring them back from the peoples and gather
them out of the lands of their enemies, I will show My holiness in
them in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the
LORD their God, when I regather them to their own land, not leaving
any of them behind after their exile among the nations. And I will no
longer hide My face from them, for I will pour out My Spirit on the
house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD.” </font>
