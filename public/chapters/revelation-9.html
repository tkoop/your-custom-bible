<font ><b>The Fifth and Sixth Trumpets</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet,
and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth, and it was
given the key to the pit of the Abyss. The star opened the pit of the
Abyss, and smoke rose out of it like the smoke of a great furnace,
and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And out of the smoke, locusts descended on
the earth, and they were given power like that of the scorpions of
the earth. They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any
plant or tree, but only those who did not have the seal of God on
their foreheads. The locusts were not given power to kill them, but
only to torment them for five months, and their torment was like the
stinging of a scorpion. In those days men will seek death and will
not find it; they will long to die, but death will escape them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the locusts looked like horses
prepared for battle, with something like crowns of gold on their
heads, and faces like the faces of men. They had hair like that of
women, and teeth like those of lions. They also had thoraxes like
breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the roar
of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. They had tails with
stingers like scorpions, which had the power to injure people for
five months. They were ruled by a king, the angel of the Abyss. His
name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek it is Apollyon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The first woe has passed. Behold, two woes
are still to follow. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet,
and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before
God saying to the sixth angel with the trumpet, “Release the four
angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the four angels who had been prepared
for this hour and day and month and year were released to kill a
third of mankind. And the number of mounted troops was two hundred
million; I heard their number. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the horses and riders in my vision
looked like this: The riders had breastplates the colors of fire,
sapphire, and sulfur. The heads of the horses were like the heads of
lions, and out of their mouths proceeded fire, smoke, and sulfur. A
third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke, and
sulfur that proceeded from their mouths. For the power of the horses
was in their mouths and in their tails; indeed, their tails were like
snakes, having heads with which to inflict harm. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the rest of mankind who were not
killed by these plagues still did not repent of the works of their
hands. They did not stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver,
bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk.
Furthermore, they did not repent of their murder, sorcery, sexual
immorality, and theft. </font>
