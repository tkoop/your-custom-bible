<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Fifth Trumpet</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth, and it was given the key to the pit of the Abyss.
<span class="reftext">2</span>The star opened the pit of the Abyss, and smoke rose out of it like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And out of the smoke, locusts descended on the earth, and they were given power like that of the scorpions of the earth.
<span class="reftext">4</span>They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
<span class="reftext">5</span>The locusts were not given power to kill them, but only to torment them for five months, and their torment was like the stinging of a scorpion.
<span class="reftext">6</span>In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will escape them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>And the locusts looked like horses prepared for battle, with something like crowns of gold on their heads, and faces like the faces of men.
<span class="reftext">8</span>They had hair like that of women, and teeth like those of lions.
<span class="reftext">9</span>They also had thoraxes like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.
<span class="reftext">10</span>They had tails with stingers like scorpions, which had the power to injure people for five months.
<span class="reftext">11</span>They were ruled by a king, the angel of the Abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon,<span class="fn">a</span>  and in Greek it is Apollyon.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>The first woe has passed. Behold, two woes are still to follow.
</p><p class="hdg">The Sixth Trumpet</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God
<span class="reftext">14</span>saying to the sixth angel with the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So the four angels who had been prepared for this hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And the number of mounted troops was two hundred million; I heard their number.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Now the horses and riders in my vision looked like this: The riders had breastplates the <span class='spell ca'>colours</span><span class='spell gb'>colours</span><span class='spell us'>colors</span> of fire, sapphire, and <span class='spell ca'>sulphur</span><span class='spell gb'>sulphur</span><span class='spell us'>sulfur</span>. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceeded fire, smoke, and <span class='spell ca'>sulphur</span><span class='spell gb'>sulphur</span><span class='spell us'>sulfur</span>.
<span class="reftext">18</span>A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke, and <span class='spell ca'>sulphur</span><span class='spell gb'>sulphur</span><span class='spell us'>sulfur</span> that proceeded from their mouths.
<span class="reftext">19</span>For the power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; indeed, their tails were like snakes, having heads with which to inflict harm.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now the rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the works of their hands. They did not stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Furthermore, they did not repent of their murder, sorcery, sexual immorality, and theft.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Abaddon</i> means <i class="calibre6">Destruction</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Apollyon</i> means <i class="calibre6">Destroyer</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
