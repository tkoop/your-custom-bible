<font face="Tahoma, serif">Some time later Joseph was told, “Your
father is ill.” So he set out with his two sons, Manasseh and
Ephraim. When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,”
Israel rallied his strength and sat up in bed. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty
appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there He blessed me
and told me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you; I
will make you a multitude of peoples, and will give this land to your
descendants after you as an everlasting possession.’ </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And now your two sons born to you in Egypt
before I came to you here shall be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and
Manasseh shall be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. Any
children born to you after them shall be yours, and they shall be
called by the names of their brothers in the territory they inherit. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now as for me, when I was returning from
Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died along the way in the land of Canaan,
some distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to
Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem). </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he
asked, “Who are these?” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Joseph said to his father, “They are the

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jacob said, “Please bring them to me,

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Israel’s eyesight was poor because
of old age; he could hardly see. Joseph brought his sons to him, and
his father kissed them and embraced them. </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I never expected to see your face

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Joseph removed his sons from his

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Joseph took both of them—with
Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh
in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand—and brought them
close to him. But Israel stretched out his right hand and put it on
the head of Ephraim, the younger; and crossing his hands, he put his
left on Manasseh’s head, although Manasseh was the firstborn. Then
he blessed Joseph and said: </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Joseph saw that his father had placed
his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he was displeased and took his
father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s.
“Not so, my father!” Joseph said. “This one is the firstborn;
put your right hand on his head.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But his father refused. “I know, my son,
