<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Some time later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he set out with his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
<span class="reftext">2</span>When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel rallied his strength and sat up in bed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Jacob said to Joseph, “God <span class='cap'>Almighty</span><span class='nocap'>almighty</span><span class="fn">a</span>  appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> blessed me
<span class="reftext">4</span>and told me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you; I will make you a multitude of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And now <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here shall be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Any children born to you after them shall be <span class='youpl' data-word='yours'>yours</span>, and they shall be called by the names of their brothers in the territory they inherit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now as for me, when I was returning from Paddan,<span class="fn">b</span>  to my sorrow Rachel died along the way in the land of Canaan, some distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem).
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Joseph said to his father, “They are the sons God has given me in this place.” </p><p class="reg1"> So Jacob said, “Please bring them to me, that I may bless them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now Israel’s eyesight was poor because of old age; he could hardly see. Joseph brought his sons to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>“I never expected to see your face again,” Israel said to Joseph, “but now God has let me see your children as well.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Joseph removed his sons from his father’s knees and bowed facedown.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And Joseph took both of them—with Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand—and brought them close to him.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But Israel stretched out his right hand and put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger; and crossing his hands, he put his left on Manasseh’s head, although Manasseh was the firstborn.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Then he blessed Joseph and said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, </p><p class="indent"> the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>the angel<span class="fn">c</span>  who has redeemed me from all harm—</p><p class="indent"> may <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> bless these boys. </p><p class="indent1"> And may they be called by my name </p><p class="indent"> and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, </p><p class="indent"> and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>When Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he was displeased and took his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s.
<span class="reftext">18</span>“Not so, my father!” Joseph said. “This one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>But his father refused. “I know, my son, I know!” he said. “He too shall become a people, and he too shall be great; nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So that day Jacob blessed them and said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“By you shall Israel pronounce this blessing: </p><p class="indent">‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1"> So he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then Israel said to Joseph, “Look, I am about to die, but God will be with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and bring <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> back to the land of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers.
<span class="reftext">22</span>And to you, as one who is above your brothers, I give the ridge of land<span class="fn">d</span>  that I took from the Amorites with my sword and bow.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">El-Shaddai</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, northwest Mesopotamia<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">one portion of the land</i>; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">shekem</i>, which sounds like the town and district called <i class="calibre6">Shechem</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
