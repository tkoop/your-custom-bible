<font ><b>Daniel’s Visions</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the first year of the reign of
Belshazzar over Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed
through his mind as he lay on his bed. He wrote down the dream, and
this is the summary of his account. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Daniel declared: “In my vision in the
night I looked, and suddenly the four winds of heaven were churning
up the great sea. Then four great beasts came up out of the sea, each
one different from the others: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.4cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >The first beast was like a lion, and it
had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off
and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet
like a man, and given the mind of a man. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >Suddenly another beast appeared, which
looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had
three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. So it was told, ‘Get up
and gorge yourself on flesh!’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >Next, as I watched, another beast
appeared. It was like a leopard, and on its back it had four wings
like those of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and it was given
authority to rule. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >After this, as I watched in my vision in
the night, suddenly a fourth beast appeared, and it was
terrifying—dreadful and extremely strong—with large iron teeth.
It devoured and crushed; then it trampled underfoot whatever was
left. It was different from all the beasts before it, and it had ten
horns. While I was contemplating the horns, suddenly another horn, a
little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were
uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like those of a man and a
mouth that spoke words of arrogance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As I continued to watch, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >thrones were set in place, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and the Ancient of Days took His seat. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >His clothing was white as snow, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and the hair of His head was like pure
wool. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >His throne was flaming with fire, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and its wheels were all ablaze. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >A river of fire was flowing, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >coming out from His presence. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Thousands upon thousands attended Him, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and myriads upon myriads stood before Him.
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >The court was convened, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and the books were opened. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I kept watching because of the
arrogant words the horn was speaking. As I continued to watch, the
beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and thrown into the
blazing fire. As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was
removed, but they were granted an extension of life for a season and
a time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In my vision in the night I continued to
watch, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and I saw One like the Son of Man </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >coming with the clouds of heaven. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He approached the Ancient of Days </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and was led into His presence. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >And He was given dominion, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >glory, and kingship, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >that the people of every nation and
language </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >should serve Him. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >His dominion is an everlasting dominion </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >that will not pass away, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and His kingdom is one </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >that will never be destroyed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit, and
the visions in my mind alarmed me. I approached one of those who were
standing there, and I asked him the true meaning of all this. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he told me the interpretation of these
things: ‘These four great beasts are four kings who will arise from
the earth. But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom
and possess it forever—yes, forever and ever.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I wanted to know the true meaning of
the fourth beast, which was different from all the others—extremely
terrifying—devouring and crushing with iron teeth and bronze claws,
then trampling underfoot whatever was left. I also wanted to know
about the ten horns on its head and the other horn that came up,
before which three of them fell—the horn whose appearance was more
imposing than the others, with eyes and with a mouth that spoke words
of arrogance. As I watched, this horn was waging war against the
saints and prevailing against them, until the Ancient of Days arrived
and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and
the time came for them to possess the kingdom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what he said: ‘The fourth beast
is a fourth kingdom that will appear on the earth, different from all
the other kingdoms, and it will devour the whole earth, trample it
down, and crush it. And the ten horns are ten kings who will rise
from this kingdom. After them another king, different from the
earlier ones, will rise and subdue three kings. He will speak out
against the Most High and oppress the saints of the Most High,
intending to change the appointed times and laws; and the saints will
be given into his hand for a time, and times, and half a time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the court will convene, and his
dominion will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. Then
the sovereignty, dominion, and greatness of the kingdoms under all of
heaven will be given to the people, the saints of the Most High. His
kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will serve and
obey Him.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus ends the matter. As for me, Daniel,
my thoughts troubled me greatly, and my face turned pale. But I kept
the matter to myself.” </font>
