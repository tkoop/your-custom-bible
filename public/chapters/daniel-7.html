He wrote down the dream, and this is the summary of his account.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Daniel declared: “In my vision in the night I looked, and suddenly the four winds of heaven were churning up the great sea.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">a</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a><span class="reftext">3</span>Then four great beasts came up out of the sea, each one different from the others:
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a></p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>The first beast was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and given the mind of a man.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a></p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Suddenly another beast appeared, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. So it was told, ‘Get up and gorge yourself on flesh!’
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a></p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Next, as I watched, another beast appeared. It was like a leopard, and on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. The beast also had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a></p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>After this, as I watched in my vision in the night, suddenly a fourth beast appeared, and it was terrifying—dreadful and extremely strong—with large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed; then it trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the beasts before it, and it had ten horns.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a><span class="reftext">8</span>While I was contemplating the horns, suddenly another horn, a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like those of a man and a mouth that spoke words of arrogance.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a></p><p class="hdg">Daniel’s Vision of the Ancient of Days</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>As I continued to watch, </p><p class="indent1stline"> thrones were set in place, </p><p class="indent"> and the Ancient of Days took His seat. </p><p class="indent1"> His clothing was white as snow, </p><p class="indent"> and the hair of His head was like pure wool. </p><p class="indent1"> His throne was flaming with fire, </p><p class="indent"> and its wheels were all ablaze.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a></p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>A river of fire was flowing, </p><p class="indent"> coming out from His presence. </p><p class="indent1"> Thousands upon thousands attended Him, </p><p class="indent"> and myriads upon myriads stood before Him. </p><p class="indent1"> The court was convened, </p><p class="indent"> and the books were opened.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then I kept watching because of the arrogant words the horn was speaking. As I continued to watch, the beast was slain, and its body was destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a><span class="reftext">12</span>As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was removed, but they were granted an extension of life for a season and a time.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a></p><p class="hdg">Daniel’s Vision of the Son of Man</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>In my vision in the night I continued to watch, </p><p class="indent1stline"> and I saw One like the Son of Man<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">b</a></span>  </p><p class="indent"> coming with the clouds of heaven.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">c</a></span>  </p><p class="indent1"> He approached the Ancient of Days </p><p class="indent"> and was led into His presence.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a></p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And He was given dominion, </p><p class="indent"> glory, and kingship, </p><p class="indent1"> that the people of every nation and language </p><p class="indent"> should serve Him. </p><p class="indent1"> His dominion is an everlasting dominion </p><p class="indent"> that will not pass away, </p><p class="indent1"> and His kingdom is one </p><p class="indent"> that will never be destroyed.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a></p><p class="hdg">Daniel’s Visions Interpreted</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit, and the visions in my mind alarmed me.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a><span class="reftext">16</span>I approached one of those who were standing there, and I asked him the true meaning of all this. </p><p class="reg1"> So he told me the interpretation of these things:
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a><span class="reftext">17</span>‘These four great beasts are four kings who will arise from the earth.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a><span class="reftext">18</span>But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever—yes, forever and ever.’
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others—extremely terrifying—devouring and crushing with iron teeth and bronze claws, then trampling underfoot whatever was left.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a><span class="reftext">20</span>I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn whose appearance was more imposing than the others, with eyes and with a mouth that spoke words of arrogance.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="21"></a><span class="reftext">21</span>As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and prevailing against them,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a><span class="reftext">22</span>until the Ancient of Days arrived and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came for them to possess the kingdom.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="23"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>This is what he said: ‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on the earth, different from all the other kingdoms, and it will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and crush it.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="24"></a><span class="reftext">24</span>And the ten horns are ten kings who will rise from this kingdom. After them another king, different from the earlier ones, will rise and subdue three kings.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a><span class="reftext">25</span>He will speak out against the Most High and oppress the saints of the Most High, intending to change the appointed times and laws; and the saints will be given into his hand for a time, and times, and half a time.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="26"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>But the court will convene, and his dominion will be taken away and completely destroyed forever.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="27"></a><span class="reftext">27</span>Then the sovereignty, dominion, and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven will be given to the people, the saints of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will serve and obey Him.’
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="28"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Thus ends the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts troubled me greatly, and my face turned pale. But I kept the matter to myself.”</p></div><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Perhaps <i class="calibre6">the Great Sea</i>, that is, the Mediterranean Sea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">one like a son of man</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> See <a href="953.htm#30" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Matthew 24:30</a>, <a href="955.htm#64" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Matthew 26:64</a>, <a href="970.htm#26" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Mark 13:26</a>, <a href="971.htm#62" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Mark 14:62</a>, <a href="994.htm#27" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Luke 21:27</a>, <a href="1168.htm#13" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Revelation 1:13</a>, and <a href="1181.htm#14" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Revelation 14:14</a>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
