<font >What, then, is the advantage of being a
Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? Much in every way. First
of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God. </font>

their lack of faith nullify God’s faithfulness? Certainly not! Let
God be true and every man a liar. As it is written: </font>

<font >But if our unrighteousness highlights the
righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to
inflict His wrath on us? I am speaking in human terms. Certainly not!
In that case, how could God judge the world? However, if my falsehood
accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory, why
am I still condemned as a sinner? Why not say, as some slanderously
claim that we say, “Let us do evil that good may result”? Their
condemnation is deserved! </font>

righteousness of God has been revealed, as attested by the Law and
the Prophets. And this righteousness from God comes through faith in
Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no distinction, for all
have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified
freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. </font>

faith in Jesus. </font>
