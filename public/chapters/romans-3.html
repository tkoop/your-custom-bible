<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">God Remains Faithful</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>What, then, is the advantage of being a Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?
<span class="reftext">2</span>Much in every way. First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words<span class="fn">a</span>  of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God’s faithfulness?
<span class="reftext">4</span>Certainly not! Let God be true and every man a liar. As it is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">“So that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> may be proved right when <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> speak </p><p class="indent"> and victorious when <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> judge.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But if our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to inflict <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> wrath on us? I am speaking in human terms.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Certainly not! In that case, how could God judge the world?
<span class="reftext">7</span>However, if my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?
<span class="reftext">8</span>Why not say, as some slanderously claim that we say, “Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is deserved!
</p><p class="hdg">There Is No One Righteous<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 14:1–7; Psalm 53:1–6; Isaiah 59:1–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>What then? Are we any better? Not at all. For we have already made the charge that Jews and Greeks alike are all under sin.
<span class="reftext">10</span>As it is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">“There is no one righteous, </p><p class="indent"> not even one.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>There is no one who understands, </p><p class="indent"> no one who seeks God.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>All have turned away, </p><p class="indent"> they have together become worthless; </p><p class="indent1"> there is no one who does good, </p><p class="indent"> not even one.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>“Their throats are open graves; </p><p class="indent"> their tongues practice deceit.”<span class="fn">d</span>  </p><p class="indent">“The venom of vipers is on their lips.”<span class="fn">e</span>

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Therefore no one will be justified in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> sight by works of the law. For the law merely brings awareness of sin.

<span class="reftext">22</span>And this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no distinction,
<span class="reftext">23</span>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
<span class="reftext">24</span>and are justified freely by <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>God presented <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> as the atoning sacrifice<span class="fn">i</span>  through faith in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> blood, in order to demonstrate <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> righteousness, because in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> forbearance <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had passed over the sins committed beforehand.
<span class="reftext">26</span>He did this to demonstrate <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and to justify the one who has faith in Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of works? No, but on that of faith.
<span class="reftext">28</span>For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Is God the God of Jews only? Is <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,
<span class="reftext">30</span>since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Certainly not! Instead, we uphold the law.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the oracles</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">when You are judged</i>; Psalm 51:4 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Psalm 14:1–3 and Psalm 53:1–3 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Psalm 5:9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Psalm 140:3<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Psalm 10:7 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Isaiah 59:7–8 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Psalm 36:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Or <i class="calibre6">as a propitiation</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
