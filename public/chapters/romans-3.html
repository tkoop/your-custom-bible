<font ><b>Righteousness through Faith in Christ</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >What, then, is the advantage of being a
Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? Much in every way. First
of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >What if some did not have faith? Will
their lack of faith nullify God’s faithfulness? Certainly not! Let
God be true and every man a liar. As it is written: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >So that You may be proved right when
You speak </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and victorious when You judge.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if our unrighteousness highlights the
righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to
inflict His wrath on us? I am speaking in human terms. Certainly not!
In that case, how could God judge the world? However, if my falsehood
accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory, why
am I still condemned as a sinner? Why not say, as some slanderously
claim that we say, “Let us do evil that good may result”? Their
condemnation is deserved! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >What then? Are we any better? Not at all.
For we have already made the charge that Jews and Greeks alike are
all under sin. As it is written: </font>

<font >Now we know that whatever the law says, it
says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be
silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. Therefore no
one will be justified in His sight by works of the law. For the law
merely brings awareness of sin. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But now, apart from the law, the
righteousness of God has been revealed, as attested by the Law and
the Prophets. And this righteousness from God comes through faith in
Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no distinction, for all
have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified
freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >God presented Him as the atoning sacrifice
through faith in His blood, in order to demonstrate His
righteousness, because in His forbearance He had passed over the sins
committed beforehand. He did this to demonstrate His righteousness at
the present time, so as to be just and to justify the one who has
faith in Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded.
On what principle? On that of works? No, but on that of faith. For we
maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the
law. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the
God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, since there is only one
God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised
through that same faith. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do we, then, nullify the law by this
faith? Certainly not! Instead, we uphold the law. </font>
