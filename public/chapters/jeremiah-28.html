<font ><b>Hananiah’s False Prophecy</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the fifth month of that same year, the
fourth year, near the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of
Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said
to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all
the people: “This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel,
says: ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. Within two
years I will restore to this place all the articles of the house of
the LORD that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and
carried to Babylon. And I will restore to this place Jeconiah son of
Jehoiakim king of Judah, along with all the exiles from Judah who
went to Babylon,’ declares the LORD, ‘for I will break the yoke
of the king of Babylon.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the
prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people
who were standing in the house of the LORD. “Amen!” Jeremiah
said. “May the LORD do so! May the LORD fulfill the words you have
prophesied, and may He restore the articles of His house and all the
exiles back to this place from Babylon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, listen now to this message I
am speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people. The
prophets of old who preceded you and me prophesied war, disaster, and
plague against many lands and great kingdoms. As for the prophet who
prophesies peace, only if the word of the prophet comes true will the
prophet be recognized as one the LORD has truly sent.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke
off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it. And in the
presence of all the people Hananiah proclaimed, “This is what the
LORD says: ‘In this way, within two years I will break the yoke of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, Jeremiah the prophet went on his
way. But shortly after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke off
his neck, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Go and tell
Hananiah that this is what the LORD says: ‘You have broken a yoke
of wood, but in its place you have fashioned a yoke of iron.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this is what the LORD of Hosts, the
God of Israel, says: ‘I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all
these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and
they will serve him. I have even given him control of the beasts of
the field.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the
prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The LORD did not send you, but
you have persuaded this people to trust in a lie. Therefore this is
what the LORD says: ‘I am about to remove you from the face of the
earth. You will die this year because you have preached rebellion
against the LORD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And in the seventh month of that very
year, the prophet Hananiah died. </font>
