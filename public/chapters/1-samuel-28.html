<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now in those days the Philistines gathered
their forces for warfare against Israel. So Achish said to David,
“You must understand that you and your men are to go out to battle
with me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">David replied, “Then you will come to
know what your servant can do.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Very well,” said Achish. “I will
make you my bodyguard for life.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now by this time Samuel had died, and all
Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And
Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Philistines came together and camped
at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and camped at Gilboa. When
Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid and trembled violently.
He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or
Urim or prophets. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Saul said to his servants, “Find me
a woman who is a medium, so I can go and consult her.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">There is a medium at Endor,” his
servants replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Saul disguised himself by putting on
different clothes, and he set out with two of his men. They came to
the woman at night, and Saul said, “Consult a spirit for me. Bring
up for me the one I name.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the woman replied, “Surely you know
what Saul has done, how he has killed the mediums and spiritists in
the land. Why have you set a trap to get me killed?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Saul swore to her by the LORD: “As
surely as the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for
this.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Whom shall I bring up for you?” the
woman asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Bring up Samuel,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when the woman saw Samuel, she cried
out in a loud voice and said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me?
You are Saul!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not be afraid,” the king replied.
“What do you see?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I see a god coming up out of the
earth,” the woman answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">What does he look like?” asked Saul. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">An old man is coming up,” she
replied. “And he is wearing a robe.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he
bowed facedown in reverence. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you
disturbed me by bringing me up?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am deeply distressed,” replied
Saul. “The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned
away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by
dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Why do you consult me,” asked Samuel,
“since the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy? He
has done exactly what He spoke through me: The LORD has torn the
kingship out of your hand and given it to your neighbor David.
Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out His burning anger
against Amalek, the LORD has done this to you today. Moreover, the
LORD will deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines,
and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. And the LORD will
deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Immediately Saul fell flat on the ground,
terrified by the words of Samuel. And his strength was gone, because
he had not eaten anything all that day and night. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the woman came to Saul and saw how
distraught he was, she said to him, “Look, your maidservant has
obeyed your voice. I took my life in my hands and did as you told me.
Now please listen to your servant and let me set a morsel of bread
before you so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Saul refused, saying, “I will not eat.”
But his servants joined the woman in urging him, and he heeded their
voice. He got up from the ground and sat on the bed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The woman had a fattened calf at her
house, and she quickly slaughtered it. She also took flour, kneaded
it, and baked unleavened bread. She served it to Saul and his
servants, and they ate. And that night they got up and left. </font>
