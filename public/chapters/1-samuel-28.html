<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Philistines Gather against Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now in those days the Philistines gathered their forces for warfare against Israel. So Achish said to David, “You must understand that you and your men are to go out to battle with me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>David replied, “Then you will come to know what your servant can do.” </p><p class="reg1">“Very well,” said Achish. “I will make you my bodyguard for life.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Now by this time Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>The Philistines came together and camped at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and camped at Gilboa.
<span class="reftext">5</span>When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid and trembled violently.
<span class="reftext">6</span>He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim<span class="fn">a</span>  or prophets.
</p><p class="hdg">Saul and the Medium of Endor</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then Saul said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I can go and consult her.” </p><p class="reg1">“There is a medium at Endor,” his servants replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So Saul disguised himself by putting on different clothes, and he set out with two of his men. They came to the woman at night, and Saul said, “Consult a spirit for me. Bring up for me the one I name.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>But the woman replied, “Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has killed the mediums and spiritists in the land. Why have you set a trap to get me killed?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then Saul swore to her by the LORD: “As surely as the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>“Whom shall I bring up for you?” the woman asked. </p><p class="reg1">“Bring up Samuel,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out in a loud voice and said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>“Do not be afraid,” the king replied. “What do you see?” </p><p class="reg1">“I see a god<span class="fn">b</span>  coming up out of the earth,” the woman answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>“What does he look like?” asked Saul. </p><p class="reg1">“An old man is coming up,” she replied. “And he is wearing a robe.” </p><p class="reg1"> So Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed facedown in reverence.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” </p><p class="reg1">“I am deeply distressed,” replied Saul. “The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>“Why do you consult me,” asked Samuel, “since the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy?
<span class="reftext">17</span>He has done exactly what He spoke through me: The LORD has torn the kingship out of your hand and given it to your neighbour David.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out His burning anger against Amalek, the LORD has done this to you today.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Moreover, the LORD will deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. And the LORD will deliver the army of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Immediately Saul fell flat on the ground, terrified by the words of Samuel. And his strength was gone, because he had not eaten anything all that day and night.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>When the woman came to Saul and saw how distraught he was, she said to him, “Look, your maidservant has obeyed your voice. I took my life in my hands and did as you told me.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Now please listen to your servant and let me set a morsel of bread before you so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Saul refused, saying, “I will not eat.” But his servants joined the woman in urging him, and he heeded their voice. He got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>The woman had a fattened calf at her house, and she quickly slaughtered it. She also took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread.
<span class="reftext">25</span>She served it to Saul and his servants, and they ate. And that night they got up and left.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Lights</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">I see a spirit</i> or <i class="calibre6">I see a divine being</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
