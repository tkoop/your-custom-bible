</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Grace and peace to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from God our <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</p><p class="hdg">The God of All Comfort</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Blessed be the God and <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> of our Lord Jesus Christ, the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> of compassion and the God of all comfort,
<span class="reftext">4</span>who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>If we are afflicted, it is for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> comfort, which accomplishes in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we experience.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And our hope for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> is sure, because we know that just as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> share in our sufferings, so also you will share in our comfort.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>We do not want <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to be unaware, brothers, of the hardships we encountered in the province of Asia.<span class="fn">a</span>  We were under a burden far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Indeed, we felt we were under the sentence of death, in order that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will deliver us. In <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> we have placed our hope that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will yet again deliver us,
<span class="reftext">11</span>as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> shown us in answer to their prayers.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Change of Plans</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in relation to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God—not in worldly<span class="fn">b</span>  wisdom, but in the grace of God.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For we do not write <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> anything that is beyond <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> ability to read and understand. And I hope that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will understand us completely,
<span class="reftext">14</span>as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have already understood us in part, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may boast of us just as we will boast of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in the day of our Lord Jesus.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Confident of this, I planned to visit <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> first, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> might receive a double blessing.
<span class="reftext">16</span>I wanted to visit <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> on my way to Macedonia, and to return to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from Macedonia, and then to have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> help me on my way to Judea.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>When I planned this, did I do it carelessly? Or do I make my plans by human standards, so as to say “Yes, yes” when I really mean “No, no”?
<span class="reftext">18</span>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> is not “Yes” and “No.”
<span class="reftext">19</span>For the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span> of God, Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> by me and Silvanus<span class="fn">d</span>  and Timothy, was not “Yes” and “No,” but in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> it has always been “Yes.”
<span class="reftext">20</span>For all the promises of God are “Yes” in Christ. And so through <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, our “Amen” is spoken to the glory of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Now it is God who establishes both us and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in Christ. He anointed us,
<span class="reftext">22</span>placed <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> seal on us, and put <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> in our hearts as a pledge of what is to come.
<span class="reftext">23</span>I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> that I did not return to Corinth.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Not that we lord it over <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faith, but we are fellow workers with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> for your joy, because it is by faith that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> stand firm.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">in Asia</i>; Asia was a Roman province in what is now western Turkey. <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">fleshly</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">the Lord Jesus</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> That is, Silas<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
