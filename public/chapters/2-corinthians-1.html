<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<font >Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,
who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in
any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God. For
just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so also through
Christ our comfort overflows. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >If we are afflicted, it is for your
comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort,
which accomplishes in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we
experience. And our hope for you is sure, because we know that just
as you share in our sufferings, so also you will share in our
comfort. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >We do not want you to be unaware,
brothers, of the hardships we encountered in the province of Asia. We
were under a burden far beyond our ability to endure, so that we
despaired even of life. Indeed, we felt we were under the sentence of
death, in order that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God, who
raises the dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >He has delivered us from such a deadly
peril, and He will deliver us. In Him we have placed our hope that He
will yet again deliver us, as you help us by your prayers. Then many
will give thanks on our behalf for the favor shown us in answer to
their prayers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And this is our boast: Our conscience
testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and
especially in relation to you, in the holiness and sincerity that are
from God—not in worldly wisdom, but in the grace of God. For we do
not write you anything that is beyond your ability to read and
understand. And I hope that you will understand us completely, as you
have already understood us in part, so that you may boast of us just
as we will boast of you in the day of our Lord Jesus. </font>

<font >Confident of this, I planned to visit you
first, so that you might receive a double blessing. I wanted to visit
you on my way to Macedonia, and to return to you from Macedonia, and
then to have you help me on my way to Judea. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When I planned this, did I do it
carelessly? Or do I make my plans by human standards, so as to say
“Yes, yes” when I really mean “No, no”? But as surely as God
is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.” For
the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed among you by me and
Silvanus and Timothy, was not “Yes” and “No,” but in Him it
has always been “Yes.” For all the promises of God are “Yes”
in Christ. And so through Him, our “Amen” is spoken to the glory
of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now it is God who establishes both us and
you in Christ. He anointed us, placed His seal on us, and put His
Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of what is to come. I call God as my
witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to
Corinth. Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow
workers with you for your joy, because it is by faith that you stand
firm. </font>
