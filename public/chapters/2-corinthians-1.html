<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Paul Greets the Corinthians<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 18:1–11; 1 Corinthians 1:1–3)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, </p><p class="reg1"> To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia:
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</p><p class="hdg">The God of All Comfort</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,
<span class="reftext">4</span>who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which accomplishes in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we experience.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And our hope for you is sure, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you will share in our comfort.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>We do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of the hardships we encountered in the province of Asia.<span class="fn">a</span>  We were under a burden far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Indeed, we felt we were under the sentence of death, in order that we would not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and He will deliver us. In Him we have placed our hope that He will yet again deliver us,
<span class="reftext">11</span>as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the favor shown us in answer to their prayers.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Change of Plans</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in relation to you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God—not in worldly<span class="fn">b</span>  wisdom, but in the grace of God.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For we do not write you anything that is beyond your ability to read and understand. And I hope that you will understand us completely,
<span class="reftext">14</span>as you have already understood us in part, so that you may boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of our Lord Jesus.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Confident of this, I planned to visit you first, so that you might receive a double blessing.
<span class="reftext">16</span>I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to return to you from Macedonia, and then to have you help me on my way to Judea.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>When I planned this, did I do it carelessly? Or do I make my plans by human standards, so as to say “Yes, yes” when I really mean “No, no”?
<span class="reftext">18</span>But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.”
<span class="reftext">19</span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed among you by me and Silvanus<span class="fn">d</span>  and Timothy, was not “Yes” and “No,” but in Him it has always been “Yes.”
<span class="reftext">20</span>For all the promises of God are “Yes” in Christ. And so through Him, our “Amen” is spoken to the glory of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Now it is God who establishes both us and you in Christ. He anointed us,
<span class="reftext">22</span>placed His seal on us, and put His Spirit in our hearts as a pledge of what is to come.
<span class="reftext">23</span>I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers with you for your joy, because it is by faith that you stand firm.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">in Asia</i>; Asia was a Roman province in what is now western Turkey. <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">fleshly</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">the Lord Jesus</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> That is, Silas<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div>
