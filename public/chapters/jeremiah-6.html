</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Though she is beautiful and delicate, </p><p class="indent"> I will destroy the Daughter of Zion.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Shepherds and their flocks </p><p class="indent"> will come against her; </p><p class="indent1"> they will pitch their tents all around her, </p><p class="indent"> each tending his own portion:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>‘Prepare for battle against her; </p><p class="indent"> rise up, let us attack at noon. </p><p class="indent1"> Woe to us, for the daylight is fading; </p><p class="indent"> the evening shadows grow long.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Rise up, let us attack by night </p><p class="indent"> and destroy her fortresses!’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Cut down the trees </p><p class="indent"> and raise a siege ramp against Jerusalem. </p><p class="indent1"> This city must be punished; </p><p class="indent"> there is nothing but oppression in her midst.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>As a well gushes its water, </p><p class="indent"> so she pours out her evil. </p><p class="indent1"> Violence and destruction resound in her; </p><p class="indent"> sickness and wounds are ever before Me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Be forewarned, O Jerusalem, </p><p class="indent"> or I will turn away from you; </p><p class="indent1"> I will make you a desolation, </p><p class="indent"> a land without inhabitant.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Glean the remnant of Israel </p><p class="indent"> as thoroughly as a vine. </p><p class="indent1"> Pass your hand once more like a grape gatherer </p><p class="indent"> over the branches.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>To whom can I give this warning? </p><p class="indent"> Who will listen to me? </p><p class="indent1"> Look, their ears are closed,<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> so they cannot hear. </p><p class="indent1"> See, the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has become offensive to them; </p><p class="indent"> they find no pleasure in it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But I am full of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s wrath; </p><p class="indent"> I am tired of holding it back. </p><p class="indent1stline">“Pour it out on the children in the street, </p><p class="indent"> and on the young men gathered together. </p><p class="indent1"> For both husband and wife will be captured, </p><p class="indent"> the old and the very old alike.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Their houses will be turned over to others, </p><p class="indent"> their fields and wives as well, </p><p class="indent1"> for I will stretch out My hand </p><p class="indent"> against the inhabitants of the land,” </p><p class="selah"> declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>“For from the least of them to the greatest, </p><p class="indent"> all are greedy for gain; </p><p class="indent1"> from prophet to priest, </p><p class="indent"> all practice deceit.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>They dress the wound of My people </p><p class="indent"> with very little care, </p><p class="indent1"> saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ </p><p class="indent"> when there is no peace at all.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Are they ashamed of the abomination they have committed? </p><p class="indent"> No, they have no shame at all; </p><p class="indent"> they do not even know how to blush. </p><p class="indent1"> So they will fall among the fallen; </p><p class="indent"> when I punish them, they will collapse,” </p><p class="selah"> says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: </p><p class="indent1stline"> “Stand at the crossroads and look. </p><p class="indent"> Ask for the ancient paths: ‘Where is the good way?’ </p><p class="indent1"> Then walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. </p><p class="indent"> But they said, ‘We will not walk in it!’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>I appointed watchmen over you and said, </p><p class="indent">‘Listen for the sound of the ram’s horn.’ </p><p class="indent"> But they answered, ‘We will not listen!’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Therefore hear, O nations, </p><p class="indent"> and learn, O congregations, </p><p class="indent"> what will happen to them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Hear, O earth! I am bringing disaster on this people, </p><p class="indent"> the fruit of their own schemes, </p><p class="indent1"> because they have paid no attention to My word </p><p class="indent"> and have rejected My instruction.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>What use to Me is frankincense from Sheba </p><p class="indent"> or sweet cane from a distant land? </p><p class="indent1"> Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; </p><p class="indent"> your sacrifices do not please Me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I will lay stumbling blocks before this people; </p><p class="indent"> fathers and sons alike will be staggered; </p><p class="indent"> friends and neighbors will perish.”

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>They grasp the bow and spear;<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent"> they are cruel and merciless. </p><p class="indent1"> Their voice roars like the sea, </p><p class="indent"> and they ride upon horses, </p><p class="indent1"> lined up like men in formation </p><p class="indent"> against you, O Daughter of Zion.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>We have heard the report; </p><p class="indent"> our hands hang limp. </p><p class="indent1"> Anguish has gripped us, </p><p class="indent"> pain like that of a woman in <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Do not go out to the fields; </p><p class="indent"> do not walk the road. </p><p class="indent1"> For the enemy has a sword; </p><p class="indent"> terror is on every side.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>O daughter of my people, </p><p class="indent"> dress yourselves in sackcloth and roll in ashes. </p><p class="indent1"> Mourn with bitter wailing, </p><p class="indent"> as you would for an only son, </p><p class="indent1"> for suddenly the destroyer </p><p class="indent"> will come upon us.
