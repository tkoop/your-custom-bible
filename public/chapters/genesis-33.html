<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming
toward him with four hundred men. So he divided the children among
Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants. He put the maidservants and
their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and
Joseph at the rear. But Jacob himself went on ahead and bowed to the
ground seven times as he approached his brother. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Esau, however, ran to him and embraced
him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. And they both
wept. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Esau looked up and saw the women and
children, he asked, “Who are these with you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jacob answered, “These are the children
God has graciously given your servant.” Then the maidservants and
their children approached and bowed down. Leah and her children also
approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and
bowed down. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">What do you mean by sending this whole
company to meet me?” asked Esau. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">To find favor in your sight, my lord,”
Jacob answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I already have plenty, my brother,”
Esau replied. “Keep what belongs to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jacob insisted, “No, please! If I
have found favor in your sight, then receive this gift from my hand.
For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of
God, since you have received me favorably. Please accept my gift that
was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have
all I need.” So Jacob pressed him until he accepted. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way,
and I will go ahead of you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jacob replied, “My lord knows that
the children are frail, and I must care for sheep and cattle that are
nursing their young. If they are driven hard for even a day, all the
animals will die. Please let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will
continue on slowly, at a comfortable pace for the livestock and
children, until I come to my lord at Seir.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Let me leave some of my people with
you,” Esau said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jacob replied, “Why do that? Let me
find favor in the sight of my lord.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So that day Esau started on his way back
to Seir, but Jacob went on to Succoth, where he built a house for
himself and shelters for his livestock; that is why the place was
called Succoth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After Jacob had come from Paddan-aram, he
arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he
camped just outside the city. And the plot of ground where he pitched
his tent, he purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father,
for a hundred pieces of silver. There he set up an altar and called
it El-Elohe-Israel. </font>
