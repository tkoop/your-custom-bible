<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jacob Meets Esau</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming toward him with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.
<span class="reftext">2</span>He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But Jacob himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Esau, however, ran to him and embraced him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. And they both wept.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, “Who are these with you?” </p><p class="reg1"> Jacob answered, “These are the children God has graciously given your servant.”
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>“What do you mean by sending this whole company to meet me?” asked Esau. </p><p class="reg1">“To find <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in your sight, my lord,” Jacob answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“I already have plenty, my brother,” Esau replied. “Keep what belongs to you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>But Jacob insisted, “No, please! If I have found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in your sight, then receive this gift from my hand. For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing the face of God, since you have received me <span class='spell ca'>favourably</span><span class='spell gb'>favourably</span><span class='spell us'>favorably</span>.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Please accept my gift<span class="fn">a</span>  that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” So Jacob pressed him until he accepted.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way, and I will go ahead of you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are frail, and I must care for sheep and cattle that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard for even a day, all the animals will die.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Please let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will continue on slowly, at a comfortable pace for the livestock and children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>“Let me leave some of my people with you,” Esau said. </p><p class="reg1"> But Jacob replied, “Why do that? Let me find <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in the sight of my lord.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir,
<span class="reftext">17</span>but Jacob went on to Succoth,<span class="fn">b</span>  where he built a house for himself and shelters for his livestock; that is why the place was called Succoth.
</p><p class="hdg">Jacob Settles in Shechem</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>After Jacob had come from Paddan-aram,<span class="fn">c</span>  he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, and he camped just outside the city.
<span class="reftext">19</span>And the plot of ground where he pitched his tent, he purchased from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">20</span>There he set up an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.<span class="fn">e</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">blessing</i> or <i class="calibre6">treaty of peace</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Succoth</i> means <i class="calibre6">booths</i> or <i class="calibre6">shelters</i> or <i class="calibre6">tabernacles</i>; twice in this verse.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, northwest Mesopotamia<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">a hundred kesitahs</i>; the value or weight of the kesitah is no longer known<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">El-Elohe-Israel</i> means <i class="calibre6">God is the God of Israel</i> or <i class="calibre6">mighty is the God of Israel</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
