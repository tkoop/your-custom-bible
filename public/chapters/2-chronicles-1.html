<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Solomon son of David established
himself securely over his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him
and highly exalted him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the
commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every
leader in all Israel—the heads of the families. And Solomon and the
whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon because it was the
location of God’s Tent of Meeting, which Moses the servant of the
LORD had made in the wilderness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now David had brought the ark of God from
Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had
pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. But the bronze altar made by
Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, was in Gibeon before the
tabernacle of the LORD. So Solomon and the assembly inquired of Him
there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon offered sacrifices there before
the LORD on the bronze altar in the Tent of Meeting, where he offered
a thousand burnt offerings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">That night God appeared to Solomon and
said, “Ask, and I will give it to you!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon replied to God: “You have shown
much loving devotion to my father David, and You have made me king in
his place. Now, O LORD God, let Your promise to my father David be
fulfilled. For You have made me king over a people as numerous as the
dust of the earth. Now grant me wisdom and knowledge, so that I may
lead this people. For who is able to govern this great people of
Yours?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">God said to Solomon, “Since this was in
your heart instead of requesting riches or wealth or glory for
yourself or death for your enemies—and since you have not even
requested long life but have asked for wisdom and knowledge to govern
My people over whom I have made you king— therefore wisdom and
knowledge have been granted to you. And I will also give you riches
and wealth and honor unlike anything given to the kings before you or
after you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high
place in Gibeon before the Tent of Meeting, and he reigned over
Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon accumulated 1,400 chariots and
12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with
him in Jerusalem. The king made silver and gold as common in
Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the
foothills. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon’s horses were imported from
Egypt and Kue; the royal merchants purchased them from Kue. A chariot
could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a
horse for a hundred and fifty. Likewise, they exported them to all
the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram. </font>
