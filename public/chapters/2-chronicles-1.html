</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel—the heads of the families.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon because it was the location of God’s Tent of Meeting, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">5</span>But the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, was in Gibeon before<span class="fn">a</span>  the tabernacle of the LORD. So Solomon and the assembly inquired of Him there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Solomon offered sacrifices there before the LORD on the bronze altar in the Tent of Meeting, where he offered a thousand burnt offerings.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>That night God appeared to Solomon and said, “Ask, and I will give it to you!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Solomon replied to God: “You have shown much loving devotion<span class="fn">b</span>  to my father David, and You have made me king in his place.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Now, O LORD God, let Your promise to my father David be fulfilled. For You have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Now grant me wisdom and knowledge, so that I may lead this people.<span class="fn">c</span>  For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>God said to Solomon, “Since this was in your heart instead of requesting riches or wealth or glory for yourself or death for your enemies—and since you have not even requested long life but have asked for wisdom and knowledge to govern My people over whom I have made you king—
<span class="reftext">12</span>therefore wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you. And I will also give you riches and wealth and honour unlike anything given to the kings before you or after you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place in Gibeon before the Tent of Meeting, and he reigned over Israel.
