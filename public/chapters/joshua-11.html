<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Conquest of the Northern Cities</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now when Jabin king of Hazor heard about these things, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon; to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph;
<span class="reftext">2</span>to the kings of the north in the mountains, in the Arabah south of Chinnereth, in the foothills,<span class="fn">a</span>  and in Naphoth-dor<span class="fn">b</span>  to the west;
<span class="reftext">3</span>to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So these kings came out with all their armies, a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore, along with a great number of horses and chariots.
<span class="reftext">5</span>All these kings joined forces and encamped at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for by this time tomorrow I will deliver all of them slain before Israel. You are to hamstring their horses and burn up their chariots.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>So by the waters of Merom, Joshua and his whole army came upon them suddenly and attacked them,
<span class="reftext">8</span>and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them down and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh. They struck them down, leaving no survivors.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Joshua treated them as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had told him; he hamstrung their horses and burned up their chariots.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword, because Hazor was formerly the head of all these kingdoms.
<span class="reftext">11</span>The Israelites put everyone in Hazor to the sword, devoting them to destruction.<span class="fn">c</span>  Nothing that breathed remained, and Joshua burned down Hazor itself.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Joshua captured all these kings and their cities and put them to the sword. He devoted them to destruction, as Moses <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s servant had commanded.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds, except Hazor, which Joshua burned.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The Israelites took for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but they put all the people to the sword until they had completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone who breathed.
<span class="reftext">15</span>As <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded His servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua. That is what Joshua did, leaving nothing undone of all that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded Moses.
</p><p class="hdg">Joshua Takes the Whole Land</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So Joshua took this entire region: the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah, and the mountains of Israel and their foothills,
<span class="reftext">17</span>from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and struck them down, putting them to death.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long period of time.
<span class="reftext">19</span>No city made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites living in Gibeon; all others were taken in battle.
<span class="reftext">20</span>For it was of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to harden<span class="fn">d</span>  their hearts to engage Israel in battle, so that they would be set apart for destruction and would receive no mercy, being annihilated as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded Moses.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>At that time Joshua proceeded to eliminate the Anakim from the hill country of Hebron, Debir, and Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah and of Israel. Joshua devoted them to destruction, along with their cities.
<span class="reftext">22</span>No Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites; only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did any survive.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So Joshua took the entire land, in keeping with all that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had spoken to Moses. And Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to the allotments to their tribes. Then the land had rest from war.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Shephelah</i> or <i class="calibre6">lowlands</i>; that is, the western foothills of Judea; also in verse 16<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the heights of Dor</i>; <i class="calibre6">Naphoth-dor</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Naphath-dor</i>; see Joshua 12:23.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">cherem</i> refer to the giving over of things or persons to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in verses 12, 20, and 21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">stiffen</i> or <i class="calibre6">strengthen</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
