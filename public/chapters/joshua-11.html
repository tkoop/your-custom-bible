11</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Conquest of the Northern Cities</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when Jabin king of Hazor heard about
these things, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon; to the kings of
Shimron and Achshaph; to the kings of the north in the mountains, in
the Arabah south of Chinnereth, in the foothills, and in Naphoth-dor
to the west; to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites,
Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the
Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So these kings came out with all their
armies, a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore, along
with a great number of horses and chariots. All these kings joined
forces and encamped at the waters of Merom to fight against Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be
afraid of them, for by this time tomorrow I will deliver all of them
slain before Israel. You are to hamstring their horses and burn up
their chariots.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So by the waters of Merom, Joshua and his
whole army came upon them suddenly and attacked them, and the LORD
delivered them into the hand of Israel, who struck them down and
pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and
eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh. They struck them down,
leaving no survivors. Joshua treated them as the LORD had told him;
he hamstrung their horses and burned up their chariots. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Joshua turned back and
captured Hazor and put its king to the sword, because Hazor was
formerly the head of all these kingdoms. The Israelites put everyone
in Hazor to the sword, devoting them to destruction. Nothing that
breathed remained, and Joshua burned down Hazor itself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Joshua captured all these kings and their
cities and put them to the sword. He devoted them to destruction, as
Moses the LORD’s servant had commanded. Yet Israel did not burn any
of the cities built on their mounds, except Hazor, which Joshua
burned. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Israelites took for themselves all the
plunder and livestock of these cities, but they put all the people to
the sword until they had completely destroyed them, not sparing
anyone who breathed. As the LORD had commanded His servant Moses, so
Moses commanded Joshua. That is what Joshua did, leaving nothing
undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Joshua took this entire region: the
hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen, the western
foothills, the Arabah, and the mountains of Israel and their
foothills, from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, as far as
Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon. He
captured all their kings and struck them down, putting them to death.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Joshua waged war against all these kings
for a long period of time. No city made peace with the Israelites
except the Hivites living in Gibeon; all others were taken in battle.
For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts to engage Israel in
battle, so that they would be set apart for destruction and would
receive no mercy, being annihilated as the LORD had commanded Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Joshua proceeded to eliminate
the Anakim from the hill country of Hebron, Debir, and Anab, and from
all the hill country of Judah and of Israel. Joshua devoted them to
destruction, along with their cities. No Anakim were left in the land
of the Israelites; only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did any survive. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Joshua took the entire land, in keeping
with all that the LORD had spoken to Moses. And Joshua gave it as an
inheritance to Israel according to the allotments to their tribes.
Then the land had rest from war. </font>
