<font ><b>Manasseh’s Repentance and Restoration</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Manasseh was twelve years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. And he did
evil in the sight of the LORD by following the abominations of the
nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites. For he
rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had torn down, and
he raised up altars for the Baals and made Asherah poles. And he
worshiped and served all the host of heaven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Manasseh also built altars in the house of
the LORD, of which the LORD had said, “My Name will remain in
Jerusalem forever.” In both courtyards of the house of the LORD, he
built altars to all the host of heaven. He sacrificed his sons in the
fire in the Valley of Hinnom. He practiced sorcery, divination, and
witchcraft, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did great evil
in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Manasseh even took the carved image he had
made and set it up in the house of God, of which God had said to
David and his son Solomon, “In this temple and in Jerusalem, which
I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will establish My
Name forever. I will never again cause the feet of the Israelites to
leave the land that I assigned to your fathers, if only they are
careful to do all that I have commanded them through Moses—all the
laws, statutes, and judgments.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Manasseh led the people of Judah and
Jerusalem astray, so that they did greater evil than the nations that
the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD spoke to Manasseh and his
people, but they did not listen. So the LORD brought against them the
military commanders of the king of Assyria, who captured Manasseh,
put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him
to Babylon. And in his distress, Manasseh sought the favor of the
LORD his God and earnestly humbled himself before the God of his
fathers. And when he prayed to Him, the LORD received his plea and
heard his petition; so He brought him back to Jerusalem and to his
kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After this, Manasseh rebuilt the outer
wall of the City of David from west of Gihon in the valley to the
entrance of the Fish Gate, and he brought it around the hill of Ophel
and heightened it considerably. He also stationed military commanders
in all the fortified cities of Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He removed the foreign gods and the idol
from the house of the LORD, along with all the altars he had built on
the temple mount and in Jerusalem, and he dumped them outside the
city. Then he restored the altar of the LORD and sacrificed peace
offerings and thank offerings on it, and he told Judah to serve the
LORD, the God of Israel. Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed at
the high places, but only to the LORD their God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Manasseh,
along with his prayer to his God and the words of the seers who spoke
to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, they are indeed
written in the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. His prayer and how
God received his plea, as well as all his sin and unfaithfulness, and
the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and
idols before he humbled himself, they are indeed written in the
Records of the Seers. And Manasseh rested with his fathers and was
buried at his palace. And his son Amon reigned in his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Amon was twenty-two years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. And he did evil
in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Amon served and sacrificed to all the
idols that his father Manasseh had made, but he did not humble
himself before the LORD as his father Manasseh had done; instead,
Amon increased his guilt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the servants of Amon conspired
against him and killed him in his palace. But the people of the land
killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made
his son Josiah king in his place. </font>
