</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>There is no longer praise for Moab; </p><p class="indent"> in Heshbon<span class="fn">a</span>  they devise evil against her: </p><p class="indent">‘Come, let us cut her off from nationhood.’ </p><p class="indent1stline"> You too, O people of Madmen,<span class="fn">b</span>  will be silenced; </p><p class="indent"> the sword will pursue you.
