<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Boaz Meets Ruth</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s
side, a prominent man of noble character from the clan of Elimelech,
whose name was Boaz. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi,
“Please let me go into the fields and glean heads of grain after
someone in whose sight I may find favor.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go ahead, my daughter,” Naomi
replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Ruth departed and went out into the
field and gleaned after the harvesters. And she happened to come to
the part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of
Elimelech. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and
said to the harvesters, “The LORD be with you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD bless you,” they replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Boaz asked the foreman of his
harvesters, “Whose young woman is this?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The foreman answered, “She is the
Moabitess who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab. She has
said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the
harvesters.’ So she came out and has continued from morning until
now, except that she rested a short time in the shelter.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my
daughter. Do not go and glean in another field, and do not go away
from this place, but stay here close to my servant girls. Let your
eyes be on the field they are harvesting, and follow along after
these girls. Indeed, I have ordered the young men not to touch you.
And when you are thirsty, go and drink from the jars the young men
have filled.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At this, she fell on her face, bowing low
to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found such favor in
your eyes that you should take notice of me, even though I am a
foreigner?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Boaz replied, “I have been made fully
aware of all you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of
your husband, how you left your father and mother and the land of
your birth, and how you came to a people you did not know before. May
the LORD repay your work, and may you receive a rich reward from the
LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have taken refuge.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">My lord,” she said, “may I continue
to find favor in your eyes, for you have comforted and spoken kindly
to your maidservant, though I am not like one of your servant girls.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over
here; have some bread and dip it into the vinegar sauce.” So she
sat down beside the harvesters, and he offered her roasted grain, and
she ate and was satisfied and had some left over. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Ruth got up to glean, Boaz ordered
his young men, “Even if she gathers among the sheaves, do not
insult her. Rather, pull out for her some stalks from the bundles and
leave them for her to gather. Do not rebuke her.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Ruth gathered grain in the field until
evening. And when she beat out what she had gleaned, it was about an
ephah of barley. She picked up the grain and went into the town,
where her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought out
what she had saved from her meal and gave it to Naomi. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then her mother-in-law asked her, “Where
did you glean today, and where did you work? Blessed be the man who
noticed you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So she told her mother-in-law where she
had worked. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,”
she said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law,
“May he be blessed by the LORD, who has not withdrawn His kindness
from the living or the dead.” Naomi continued, “The man is a
close relative. He is one of our kinsman-redeemers.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also
told me, ‘Stay with my young men until they have finished gathering
all my harvest.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law
Ruth, “My daughter, it is good for you to work with his young
women, so that nothing will happen to you in another field.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls
of Boaz to glean grain until the barley and wheat harvests were
finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law. </font>
