<font >Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit,
returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the
wilderness, where for forty days He was tempted by the devil. He ate
nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He was hungry. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The devil said to Him, “If You are the

<font >Then the devil led Him up to a high place
and showed Him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. “I will
give You authority over all these kingdoms and all their glory,” he
said. “For it has been relinquished to me, and I can give it to
anyone I wish. So if You worship me, it will all be Yours.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<font >Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of
the Spirit, and the news about Him spread throughout the surrounding

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Jesus came to Nazareth, where He had
been brought up. As was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the
Sabbath. And when He stood up to read, the scroll of the prophet
Isaiah was handed to Him. Unrolling it, He found the place where it
was written: </font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then He rolled up the scroll, returned it
to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue
were fixed on Him, and He began by saying, <font color="#a80000">“Today
this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >All spoke well of Him and marveled at the
gracious words that came from His lips. “Isn’t this the son of
Joseph?” they asked. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Surely
you will quote this proverb to Me: ‘Physician, heal yourself! Do

Capernaum.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font color="#880000"> </font></font><font color="#a80000">”</font>

<font >Then He added, <font color="#a80000">“Truly
I tell you, no prophet is accepted in his hometown. But I tell you
truthfully that there were many widows in Israel in the time of
Elijah, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and great
famine swept over all the land. Yet Elijah was not sent to any of
them, but to the widow of Zarephath in Sidon. And there were many
lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet. Yet not one of
them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.”</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >On hearing this, all the people in the
synagogue were enraged. They got up, drove Him out of the town, and
led Him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order
to throw Him over the cliff. But Jesus passed through the crowd and
went on His way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then He went down to Capernaum, a town in
Galilee, and on the Sabbath He began to teach the people. They were
astonished at His teaching, because His message had authority. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >In the synagogue there was a man possessed
by the spirit of an unclean demon. He cried out in a loud voice, “Ha!
What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy
us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But Jesus rebuked the demon. <font color="#a80000">“Be
silent!”</font> He said. <font color="#a80000">“Come out of him!”</font>
At this, the demon threw the man down before them all and came out
without harming him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >All the people were overcome with
amazement and asked one another, “What is this message? With
authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come
out!” And the news about Jesus spread throughout the surrounding
region. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >After Jesus had left the synagogue, He
went to the home of Simon, whose mother-in-law was suffering from a
high fever. So they appealed to Jesus on her behalf, and He stood
over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she got up at
once and began to serve them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >At sunset, all who were ill with various
diseases were brought to Jesus, and laying His hands on each one, He
healed them. Demons also came out of many people, shouting, “You
are the Son of God!” But He rebuked the demons and would not allow
them to speak, because they knew He was the Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary
place, and the crowds were looking for Him. They came to Him and
tried to keep Him from leaving. But Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“I
must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as
well, because that is why I was sent.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And He continued to preach in the
synagogues of Judea. </font>
