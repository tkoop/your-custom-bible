<span class="reftext">2</span>where for forty days He was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and when they had ended, He was hungry.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>The devil said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But Jesus answered, <span>“It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’<span class="fn">b</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then the devil led Him up to a high place and showed Him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.
<span class="reftext">6</span>“I will give You authority over all these kingdoms and all their glory,” he said. “For it has been relinquished to me, and I can give it to anyone I wish.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So if You worship me, it will all be Yours.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But Jesus answered, <span>“It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’<span class="fn">c</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then the devil led Him to Jerusalem and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple. “If You are the Son of God,” he said, “throw Yourself down from here.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For it is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘He will command His angels concerning You </p><p class="indent"> to guard You carefully;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>and they will lift You up in their hands, </p><p class="indent"> so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.’<span class="fn">d</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But Jesus answered, <span>“It also says, ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’<span class="fn">e</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>When the devil had finished every temptation, he left Him until an opportune time.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Begins His Ministry<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 9:1–7; Matthew 4:12–17; Mark 1:14–15)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and the news about Him spread throughout the surrounding region.
<span class="reftext">15</span>He taught in their synagogues and was glorified by everyone.
</p><p class="hdg">The Rejection at Nazareth<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 61:1–11; Matthew 13:53–58; Mark 6:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then Jesus came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. As was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath. And when He stood up to read,
<span class="reftext">17</span>the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. Unrolling it, He found the place where it was written:
</p><p class="indent1stlinered"><span class="reftext">18</span>“The Spirit of the Lord is on Me, </p><p class="indentred"> because He has anointed Me </p><p class="indentred"> to preach good news to the poor. </p><p class="indentred1"> He has sent Me to proclaim liberty to the captives<span class="fn">f</span>  </p><p class="indentred"> and recovery of sight to the blind, </p><p class="indentred"> to release the oppressed,

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then He rolled up the scroll, returned it to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on Him,
<span class="reftext">21</span>and He began by saying, <span>“Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>All spoke well of Him and <span class='spell ca'>marvelled</span><span class='spell gb'>marvelled</span><span class='spell us'>marveled</span> at the gracious words that came from His lips. “Isn’t this the son of Joseph?” they asked.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“Surely you will quote this proverb to Me: ‘Physician, heal yourself! Do here in Your hometown what we have heard that You did in Capernaum.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then He added, <span>“Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in his hometown.
<span class="reftext">25</span>But I tell you truthfully that there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and great famine swept over all the land.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to the widow of Zarephath in Sidon.
<span class="reftext">27</span>And there were many lepers<span class="fn">h</span>  in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet. Yet not one of them was cleansed—only Naaman the Syrian.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>On hearing this, all the people in the synagogue were enraged.
<span class="reftext">29</span>They got up, drove Him out of the town, and led Him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw Him over the cliff.
<span class="reftext">30</span>But Jesus passed through the crowd and went on His way.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Expels an Unclean Spirit<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 1:21–28)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then He went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath He began to teach the people.
<span class="reftext">32</span>They were astonished at His teaching, because His message had authority.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>In the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon. He cried out in a loud voice,
<span class="reftext">34</span>“Ha! What do You want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>But Jesus rebuked the demon. <span>“Be silent!”</span> He said. <span>“Come out of him!”</span> At this, the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without harming him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>All the people were overcome with amazement and asked one another, “What is this message? With authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!”
<span class="reftext">37</span>And the news about Jesus spread throughout the surrounding region.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals at Peter’s House<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 8:14–17; Mark 1:29–34)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>After Jesus had left the synagogue, He went to the home of Simon, whose mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever. So they appealed to Jesus on her behalf,
<span class="reftext">39</span>and He stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she got up at once and began to serve them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>At sunset, all who were ill with various diseases were brought to Jesus, and laying His hands on each one, He healed them.
<span class="reftext">41</span>Demons also came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But He rebuked the demons and would not allow them to speak, because they knew He was the Christ.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Preaches in Judea<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 1:35–39)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place, and the crowds were looking for Him. They came to Him and tried to keep Him from leaving.
<span class="reftext">43</span>But Jesus told them, <span>“I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well, because that is why I was sent.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>And He continued to preach in the synagogues of Judea.<span class="fn">i</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the wilderness</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Deuteronomy 8:3; BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">on bread alone, but on every word of God</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Deuteronomy 6:13<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Psalm 91:11–12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Deuteronomy 6:16<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord</i>; Isaiah 61:1–2 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> A <i class="calibre6">leper</i> was one afflicted with a skin disease.
