<font ><b>David’s Song for Saul and Jonathan</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >After the death of Saul, David returned
from the slaughter of the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days.
On the third day a man with torn clothes and dust on his head arrived
from Saul’s camp. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to
pay him homage. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >Where have you come from?” David
asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >I have escaped from the Israelite
camp,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >What was the outcome?” David asked.
“Please tell me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >The troops fled from the battle,” he
replied. “Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan
are also dead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then David asked the young man who had
brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son
Jonathan are dead?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” he
replied, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the
chariots and the cavalry closing in on him. When he turned around and
saw me, he called out and I answered, ‘Here I am!’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
‘<font >Who are you?’ he asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So I told him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then he begged me, ‘Stand over me and
kill me, for agony has seized me, but my life still lingers.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So I stood over him and killed him,
because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I
took the crown that was on his head and the band that was on his arm,
and I have brought them here to my lord.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then David took hold of his own clothes
and tore them, and all the men who were with him did the same. They
mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son
Jonathan, and for the people of the LORD and the house of Israel,
because they had fallen by the sword. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And David inquired of the young man who
had brought him the report, “Where are you from?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >I am the son of a foreigner,” he
answered. “I am an Amalekite.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So David asked him, “Why were you not
afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?” Then
David summoned one of the young men and said, “Go, execute him!”
So the young man struck him down, and he died. For David had said to
the Amalekite, “Your blood be on your own head because your own
mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I killed the LORD’s
anointed.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then David took up this lament for Saul
and his son Jonathan, and he ordered that the sons of Judah be taught
the Song of the Bow. It is written in the Book of Jashar: </font>
