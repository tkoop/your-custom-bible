<span class="reftext">2</span>On the third day a man with torn clothes and dust on his head arrived from Saul’s camp. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him homage.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>“Where have you come from?” David asked. </p><p class="reg1">“I have escaped from the Israelite camp,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“What was the outcome?” David asked. “Please tell me.” </p><p class="reg1">“The troops fled from the battle,” he replied. “Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then David asked the young man who had brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” he replied, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and the cavalry closing in on him.
<span class="reftext">7</span>When he turned around and saw me, he called out and I answered, ‘Here I am!’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>‘Who are you?’ he asked. </p><p class="reg1"> So I told him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then he begged me, ‘Stand over me and kill me, for agony has seized me, but my life still lingers.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then David took hold of his own clothes and tore them, and all the men who were with him did the same.
<span class="reftext">12</span>They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the people of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And David inquired of the young man who had brought him the report, “Where are you from?” </p><p class="reg1">“I am the son of a foreigner,” he answered. “I am an Amalekite.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So David asked him, “Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s anointed?”
<span class="reftext">15</span>Then David summoned one of the young men and said, “Go, execute him!” So the young man struck him down, and he died.
<span class="reftext">16</span>For David had said to the Amalekite, “Your blood be on your own head because your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I killed <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s anointed.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">David’s Song for Saul and Jonathan</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then David took up this lament for Saul and his son Jonathan,
<span class="reftext">18</span>and he ordered that the sons of Judah be taught the <span class='cap'>Song</span><span class='nocap'>song</span><span class='bsb'>Song</span> of the Bow.<span class="fn">a</span>  It is written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span><span class='bsb'>Book</span> of Jashar:<span class="fn">b</span>
