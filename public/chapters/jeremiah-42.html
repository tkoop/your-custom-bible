<span class="reftext">2</span>Jeremiah the prophet and said, “May our petition come before you; pray to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God on behalf of this entire remnant. For few of us remain of the many, as you can see with your own eyes.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Pray that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will tell us the way we should walk and the thing we should do.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“I have heard you,” replied Jeremiah the prophet. “I will surely pray to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God as you request, and I will tell you everything that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> answers; I will not withhold a word from you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then they said to Jeremiah, “May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act upon every word that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God sends you to tell us.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will obey the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us, for we will obey the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>After ten days the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Jeremiah,
<span class="reftext">8</span>and he summoned Johanan son of Kareah, all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Jeremiah told them, “Thus says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition:
<span class="reftext">10</span>‘If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I will relent of the disaster I have brought upon you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear; do not be afraid of him, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, for I am with you to save you and deliver you from him.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And I will show you compassion, and he will have compassion on you and restore you to your own land.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ and you thus disobey the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God,
<span class="reftext">14</span>and if you say, ‘No, but we will go to the land of Egypt and live there, where we will not see war or hear the sound of the ram’s horn or hunger for bread,’
<span class="reftext">15</span>then hear the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, O remnant of Judah! This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you are determined to go to Egypt and reside there,
<span class="reftext">16</span>then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow on your heels into Egypt, and you will die there.
<span class="reftext">17</span>So all who resolve to go to Egypt to reside there will die by sword and famine and plague. Not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring upon them.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Just as My anger and wrath were poured out on the residents of Jerusalem, so will My wrath be poured out on you if you go to Egypt. You will become an object of cursing and horror, of vilification and disgrace, and you will never see this place again.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> has told you, O remnant of Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Know for sure that I have warned you today!
<span class="reftext">20</span>For you have deceived yourselves by sending me to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, saying, ‘Pray to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God on our behalf, and as for all that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God says, tell it to us and we will do it.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>For I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God in all He has sent me to tell you.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Now therefore, know for sure that by sword and famine and plague you will die in the place where you desire to go to reside.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew; LXX <i class="calibre6">Azariah</i>; see Jeremiah 43:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
