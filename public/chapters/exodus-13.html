<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Dedication of the Firstborn<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 15:19–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Consecrate to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> every firstborn male.<span class="fn">a</span>  The firstborn from every womb among the Israelites belongs to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, both of man and beast.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So Moses told the people, “Remember this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> brought you out of it by the strength of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hand. And nothing leavened shall be eaten.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Today, in the month of Abib,<span class="fn">b</span>  you are leaving.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And when <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites—the land <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> swore to your fathers that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> would give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you shall keep this service in this month.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Unleavened bread shall be eaten during those seven days. Nothing leavened may be found among you, nor shall leaven be found anywhere within your borders.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And on that day you are to explain to your son, ‘This is because of what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> did for me when I came out of Egypt.’
<span class="reftext">9</span>It shall be a sign for you on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is to be on your lips. For with a mighty hand <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> brought you out of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore you shall keep this statute at the appointed time year after year.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And after <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> swore to you and your fathers,
<span class="reftext">12</span>you are to present to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> the firstborn male of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">13</span>You must redeem every firstborn donkey with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it, you are to break its neck. And every firstborn of your sons you must redeem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>In the future, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ you are to tell him, ‘With a mighty hand <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both of man and beast. This is why I sacrifice to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> the firstborn male of every womb, but I redeem all the firstborn of my sons.’
<span class="reftext">16</span>So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead, for with a mighty hand <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> brought us out of Egypt.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Pillars of Cloud and Fire</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them along the road through the land of the Philistines, though it was shorter. For God said, “If the people face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.”
<span class="reftext">18</span>So God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span>.<span class="fn">c</span>  And the Israelites left the land of Egypt arrayed for battle.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear a solemn oath when he said, “God will surely attend to you, and then you must carry my bones with you from this place.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> went before them in a pillar of cloud to guide their way by day, and in a pillar of fire to give them light by night, so that they could travel by day or night.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place before the people.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in Luke 2:23<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Abib</i> was the first month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar, usually occurring within the months of March and April.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Sea of Reeds</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">left the land of Egypt in the fifth generation</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Genesis 50:25<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
