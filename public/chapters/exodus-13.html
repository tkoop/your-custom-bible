<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Consecrate
to Me every firstborn male. The firstborn from every womb among the
Israelites belongs to Me, both of man and beast.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses told the people, “Remember this
day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; for
the LORD brought you out of it by the strength of His hand. And
nothing leavened shall be eaten. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Today, in the month of Abib, you are
leaving. And when the LORD brings you into the land of the
Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites—the land He
swore to your fathers that He would give you, a land flowing with
milk and honey—you shall keep this service in this month. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For seven days you are to eat unleavened
bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD.
Unleavened bread shall be eaten during those seven days. Nothing
leavened may be found among you, nor shall leaven be found anywhere
within your borders. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And on that day you are to explain to your
son, ‘This is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out
of Egypt.’ It shall be a sign for you on your hand and a reminder
on your forehead that the Law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For
with a mighty hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt. Therefore you
shall keep this statute at the appointed time year after year. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And after the LORD brings you into the
land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as He swore to you and
your fathers, you are to present to the LORD the firstborn male of
every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the
LORD. You must redeem every firstborn donkey with a lamb, and if you
do not redeem it, you are to break its neck. And every firstborn of
your sons you must redeem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the future, when your son asks you,
‘What does this mean?’ you are to tell him, ‘With a mighty hand
the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. And
when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every
firstborn in the land of Egypt, both of man and beast. This is why I
sacrifice to the LORD the firstborn male of every womb, but I redeem
all the firstborn of my sons.’ So it shall serve as a sign on your
hand and a symbol on your forehead, for with a mighty hand the LORD
brought us out of Egypt.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Pharaoh let the people go, God did
not lead them along the road through the land of the Philistines,
though it was shorter. For God said, “If the people face war, they
might change their minds and return to Egypt.” So God led the
people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And
the Israelites left the land of Egypt arrayed for battle. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses took the bones of Joseph with him
because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear a solemn oath when
he said, “God will surely attend to you, and then you must carry my
bones with you from this place.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They set out from Succoth and camped at
Etham on the edge of the wilderness. And the LORD went before them in
a pillar of cloud to guide their way by day, and in a pillar of fire
to give them light by night, so that they could travel by day or
night. Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by
night left its place before the people. </font>
