<font ><b>Ezekiel’s Vision by the River Kebar</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of
the fourth month, while I was among the exiles by the River Kebar,
the heavens opened and I saw visions of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the fifth day of the month—it was the
fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin— the word of the LORD
came directly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of
the Chaldeans by the River Kebar. And there the LORD’s hand was
upon him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I looked and saw a whirlwind coming from
the north, a great cloud with fire flashing back and forth and
brilliant light all around it. In the center of the fire was a gleam
like amber, and within it was the form of four living creatures. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And this was their appearance: They had a
human form, but each had four faces and four wings. Their legs were
straight, and the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf,
gleaming like polished bronze. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Under their wings on their four sides they
had human hands. All four living creatures had faces and wings, and
their wings were touching one another. They did not turn as they
moved; each one went straight ahead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The form of their faces was that of a man,
and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the
face of an ox on the left side, and also the face of an eagle. Such
were their faces. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Their wings were spread upward; each had
two wings touching the wings of the creature on either side, and two
wings covering its body. Each creature went straight ahead. Wherever
the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they moved. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the midst of the living creatures was
the appearance of glowing coals of fire, or of torches. Fire moved
back and forth between the living creatures; it was bright, and
lightning flashed out of it. The creatures were darting back and
forth as quickly as flashes of lightning. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When I looked at the living creatures, I
saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.
The workmanship of the wheels looked like the gleam of beryl, and all
four had the same likeness. Their workmanship looked like a wheel
within a wheel. As they moved, they went in any of the four
directions, without pivoting as they moved. Their rims were high and
awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around. So as the
living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them, and when the
creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Wherever the spirit would go, they would
go, and the wheels would rise alongside them, because the spirit of
the living creatures was in the wheels. When the creatures moved, the
wheels moved; when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still;
and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose
alongside them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the
wheels. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Spread out above the heads of the living
creatures was the likeness of an awesome expanse, gleaming like
crystal. And under the expanse, their wings stretched out toward one
another. Each one also had two wings covering its body. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the creatures moved, I heard the
sound of their wings like the roar of many waters, like the voice of
the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they stood still, they lowered their
wings. And there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads
as they stood still with their wings lowered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Above the expanse over their heads was the
likeness of a throne with the appearance of sapphire, and on the
throne high above was a figure like that of a man. From what seemed
to be His waist up, I saw a gleam like amber, with what looked like
fire within it all around. And from what seemed to be His waist down,
I saw what looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The appearance of the brilliant light all
around Him was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This
was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when
I saw it, I fell facedown and heard a voice speaking. </font>
