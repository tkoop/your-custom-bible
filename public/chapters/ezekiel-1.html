<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Ezekiel’s Vision by the River Kebar<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 137:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiles by the River Kebar, the heavens opened and I saw visions of God.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin—
<span class="reftext">3</span>the word of the LORD came directly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans<span class="fn">b</span>  by the River Kebar. And there the LORD’s hand was upon him.
</p><p class="hdg">The Four Living Creatures</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I looked and saw a whirlwind coming from the north, a great cloud with fire flashing back and forth and brilliant light all around it. In the centre of the fire was a gleam like amber,<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">5</span>and within it was the form of four living creatures. </p><p class="reg1"> And this was their appearance: They had a human form,
<span class="reftext">6</span>but each had four faces and four wings.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf, gleaming like polished bronze.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four living creatures had faces and wings,
<span class="reftext">9</span>and their wings were touching one another. They did not turn as they moved; each one went straight ahead.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>The form of their faces was that of a man, and each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and also the face of an eagle.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Such were their faces. </p><p class="reg1"> Their wings were spread upward; each had two wings touching the wings of the creature on either side, and two wings covering its body.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Each creature went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they moved.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>In the midst of the living creatures was the appearance of glowing coals of fire, or of torches. Fire moved back and forth between the living creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it.
<span class="reftext">14</span>The creatures were darting back and forth as quickly as flashes of lightning.
</p><p class="hdg">The Four Wheels</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>When I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.
<span class="reftext">16</span>The workmanship of the wheels looked like the gleam of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. Their workmanship looked like a wheel within a wheel.
<span class="reftext">17</span>As they moved, they went in any of the four directions, without pivoting as they moved.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.
<span class="reftext">19</span>So as the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them, and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise alongside them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
<span class="reftext">21</span>When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose alongside them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
</p><p class="hdg">The Divine Glory</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of an awesome expanse, gleaming like crystal.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And under the expanse, their wings stretched out toward one another. Each one also had two wings covering its body.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty,<span class="fn">d</span>  like the tumult of an army. </p><p class="reg1"> When they stood still, they lowered their wings.
<span class="reftext">25</span>And there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood still with their wings lowered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Above the expanse over their heads was the likeness of a throne with the appearance of sapphire, and on the throne high above was a figure like that of a man.
<span class="reftext">27</span>From what seemed to be His waist up, I saw a gleam like amber, with what looked like fire within it all around. And from what seemed to be His waist down, I saw what looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>The appearance of the brilliant light all around Him was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell facedown and heard a voice speaking.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">from God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, the Babylonians<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">The centre of the fire looked like glowing metal</i>; similarly in verse 27<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Shaddai</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
