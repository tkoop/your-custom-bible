<font ><b>Jezebel’s Violent Death</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Elisha the prophet summoned one of the
sons of the prophets and said to him, “Tuck your cloak under your
belt, take this flask of oil, and go to Ramoth-gilead. When you
arrive, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go in,
get him away from his companions, and take him to an inner room. Then
take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and declare, ‘This is
what the LORD says: I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the
door and run. Do not delay!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the young prophet went to
Ramoth-gilead, and when he arrived, the army commanders were sitting
there. “I have a message for you, commander,” he said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >For which of us?” asked Jehu. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >For you, commander,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jehu got up and went into the house,
where the young prophet poured the oil on his head and declared,
“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anoint you
king over the LORD’s people Israel. And you are to strike down the
house of your master Ahab, so that I may avenge the blood of My
servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the LORD
shed by the hand of Jezebel. The whole house of Ahab will perish, and
I will cut off from Ahab every male, both slave and free, in Israel.
I will make the house of Ahab like the houses of Jeroboam son of
Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah. And on the plot of ground at Jezreel
the dogs will devour Jezebel, and there will be no one to bury
her.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the young prophet opened the door and
ran. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jehu went out to the servants of his
master, they asked, “Is everything all right? Why did this madman
come to you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >You know his kind and their babble,”
he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >That is a lie!” they said. “Tell us
now!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jehu answered, “He talked to me about
this and that, and he said, ‘This is what the LORD says: I anoint
you king over Israel.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Quickly, each man took his garment and put
it under Jehu on the bare steps. Then they blew the ram’s horn and
proclaimed, “Jehu is king!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of
Nimshi, conspired against Joram. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >(Now Joram and all Israel had been
defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram, but King Joram
had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had suffered at
the hands of the Arameans in the battle against Hazael their king.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jehu said, “If you commanders wish to
make me king, then do not let anyone escape from the city to go and
tell it in Jezreel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehu got into his chariot and went to
Jezreel, because Joram was laid up there and Ahaziah king of Judah
had gone down to see him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the watchman standing on the tower in
Jezreel saw Jehu’s troops approaching, and he called out, “I see
a company of troops!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Choose a rider,” Joram commanded.
“Send him out to meet them and ask, ‘Have you come in peace?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So a horseman rode off to meet Jehu and
said, “This is what the king asks: ‘Have you come in peace?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What do you know about peace?” Jehu
replied. “Fall in behind me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the watchman reported, “The
messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king sent out a second horseman,
who went to them and said, “This is what the king asks: ‘Have you
come in peace?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What do you know about peace?” Jehu
replied. “Fall in behind me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again the watchman reported, “He reached
them, but he is not coming back. And the charioteer is driving like
Jehu son of Nimshi—he is driving like a madman!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Harness!” Joram shouted, and they
harnessed his chariot. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king
of Judah set out, each in his own chariot, and met Jehu on the
property of Naboth the Jezreelite. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “Have you
come in peace, Jehu?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >How can there be peace,” he replied,
“as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel
abound?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Joram turned around and fled, calling out
to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram
between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he slumped
down in his chariot. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, “Pick
him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. For
remember that when you and I were riding together behind his father
Ahab, the LORD lifted up this burden against him: ‘As surely as I
saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday, declares
the LORD, so will I repay you on this plot of ground, declares the
LORD.’ Now then, according to the word of the LORD, pick him up and
throw him on the plot of ground.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he
fled up the road toward Beth-haggan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehu pursued him, shouting, “Shoot
him too!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they shot Ahaziah in his chariot on the
Ascent of Gur, near Ibleam, and he fled to Megiddo and died there.
Then his servants carried him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him
with his fathers in his tomb in the City of David. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >(In the eleventh year of Joram son of
Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now when Jehu arrived in Jezreel, Jezebel
heard of it. So she painted her eyes, adorned her head, and looked
down from a window. And as Jehu entered the gate, she asked, “Have
you come in peace, O Zimri, murderer of your master?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He looked up at the window and called out,
“Who is on my side? Who?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And two or three eunuchs looked down at
him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Throw her down!” yelled Jehu. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they threw her down, and her blood
splattered on the wall and on the horses as they trampled her
underfoot. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehu went in and ate and drank. “Take
care of this cursed woman,” he said, “and bury her, for she was
the daughter of a king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when they went out to bury her, they
found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they went back and told Jehu, who
replied, “This is the word of the LORD, which He spoke through His
servant Elijah the Tishbite: ‘On the plot of ground at Jezreel the
dogs will devour the flesh of Jezebel. And Jezebel’s body will lie
like dung in the field on the plot of ground at Jezreel, so that no
one can say: This is Jezebel.’” </font>
