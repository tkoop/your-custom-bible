<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jehu Anointed King of Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now Elisha the prophet summoned one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, “Tuck your cloak under your belt,<span class="fn">a</span>  take this flask of oil, and go to Ramoth-gilead.
<span class="reftext">2</span>When you arrive, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go in, get him away from his companions, and take him to an inner room.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and declare, ‘This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: I anoint you king over Israel.’ Then open the door and run. Do not delay!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So the young prophet went to Ramoth-gilead,
<span class="reftext">5</span>and when he arrived, the army commanders were sitting there. “I have a message for you, commander,” he said. </p><p class="reg1">“For which of us?” asked Jehu. </p><p class="reg1">“For you, commander,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So Jehu got up and went into the house, where the young prophet poured the oil on his head and declared, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anoint you king over <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s people Israel.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And you are to strike down the house of your master Ahab, so that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> shed by the hand of Jezebel.
<span class="reftext">8</span>The whole house of Ahab will perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male,<span class="fn">b</span>  both slave and free, in Israel.
<span class="reftext">9</span>I will make the house of Ahab like the houses of Jeroboam son of Nebat and Baasha son of Ahijah.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And on the plot of ground at Jezreel the dogs will devour Jezebel, and there will be no one to bury her.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1"> Then the young prophet opened the door and ran.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>When Jehu went out to the servants of his master, they asked, “Is everything all right? Why did this madman come to you?” </p><p class="reg1">“You know his kind and their babble,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“That is a lie!” they said. “Tell us now!” </p><p class="reg1"> So Jehu answered, “He talked to me about this and that, and he said, ‘This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: I anoint you king over Israel.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Quickly, each man took his garment and put it under Jehu on the bare steps. Then they blew the ram’s horn and proclaimed, “Jehu is king!”
</p><p class="hdg">Jehu Kills Joram and Ahaziah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 22:8–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thus Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. </p><p class="reg1">(Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Aram,
<span class="reftext">15</span>but King Joram<span class="fn">c</span>  had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had suffered at the hands of the Arameans in the battle against Hazael their king.) </p><p class="reg1"> So Jehu said, “If you commanders wish to make me king, then do not let anyone escape from the city to go and tell it in Jezreel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then Jehu got into his chariot and went to Jezreel, because Joram was laid up there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Now the watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu’s troops approaching, and he called out, “I see a company of troops!” </p><p class="reg1">“Choose a rider,” Joram commanded. “Send him out to meet them and ask, ‘Have you come in peace?’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>So a horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, “This is what the king asks: ‘Have you come in peace?’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1">“What do you know about peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.” </p><p class="reg1"> And the watchman reported, “The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So the king sent out a second horseman, who went to them and said, “This is what the king asks: ‘Have you come in peace?’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1">“What do you know about peace?” Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Again the watchman reported, “He reached them, but he is not coming back. And the charioteer is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi<span class="fn">d</span>—he is driving like a madman!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>“Harness!” Joram shouted, and they harnessed his chariot. </p><p class="reg1"> Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out, each in his own chariot, and met Jehu on the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>When Joram saw Jehu, he asked, “Have you come in peace, Jehu?” </p><p class="reg1">“How can there be peace,” he replied, “as long as the idolatry<span class="fn">e</span>  and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Joram turned around<span class="fn">f</span>  and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, “Treachery, Ahaziah!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>And Jehu said to Bidkar his officer, “Pick him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. For remember that when you and I were riding together behind his father Ahab, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lifted up this burden against him:
<span class="reftext">26</span>‘As surely as I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, so will I repay you on this plot of ground, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.’ Now then, according to the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, pick him up and throw him on the plot of ground.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he fled up the road toward Beth-haggan. </p><p class="reg1"> And Jehu pursued him, shouting, “Shoot him too!” </p><p class="reg1"> So they shot Ahaziah in his chariot on the Ascent of Gur,<span class="fn">g</span>  near Ibleam, and he fled to Megiddo and died there.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Then his servants carried him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his fathers in his tomb in the City of David.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>(In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king over Judah.)
</p><p class="hdg">Jezebel’s Violent Death</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Now when Jehu arrived in Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it. So she painted her eyes, adorned her head, and looked down from a window.
<span class="reftext">31</span>And as Jehu entered the gate, she asked, “Have you come in peace, O Zimri, murderer of your master?”<span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>He looked up at the window and called out, “Who is on my side? Who?” </p><p class="reg1"> And two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>“Throw her down!” yelled Jehu. </p><p class="reg1"> So they threw her down, and her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses as they trampled her underfoot.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Then Jehu went in and ate and drank. “Take care of this cursed woman,” he said, “and bury her, for she was the daughter of a king.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>So they went back and told Jehu, who replied, “This is the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite: ‘On the plot of ground at Jezreel the dogs will devour the flesh of Jezebel.
<span class="reftext">37</span>And Jezebel’s body will lie like dung in the field on the plot of ground at Jezreel, so that no one can say: This is Jezebel.’<span class="fn">i</span>”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Gird up your loins</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">(all) those who urinate against a wall</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Jehoram</i>, a variant of <i class="calibre6">Joram</i>; also in verses 17, 21, 22, 23, and 24<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">grandson of Nimshi</i>; see verse 14.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">adultery</i> or <i class="calibre6">prostitution</i>, here a metaphor for idolatry<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">turned his hands</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> See Syriac, Vulgate, and LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">“Shoot him, too, in his chariot!” (They did this) on the Ascent of Gur,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">“Is there peace for Zimri, the murderer of his master?”</i> See 1 Kings 16:10.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">37</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> See verse 10 and 1 Kings 21:23.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
