<span class="reftext">2</span>“Son of man, pose a riddle; speak a parable to the house of Israel
<span class="reftext">3</span>and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘A great eagle with great wings and long pinions,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> full of feathers of many <span class='spell ca'>colours</span><span class='spell gb'>colours</span><span class='spell us'>colors</span>, </p><p class="indent1"> came to Lebanon </p><p class="indent"> and took away the top of the cedar.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>He plucked off its topmost shoot, </p><p class="indent"> carried it to the land of merchants, </p><p class="indent"> and planted it in a city of traders.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>He took some of the seed of the land </p><p class="indent"> and planted it in fertile soil;<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> he placed it by abundant waters </p><p class="indent"> and set it out like a willow.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>It sprouted and became a spreading vine, </p><p class="indent"> low in height, with branches turned toward him; </p><p class="indent"> yet its roots remained where it stood. </p><p class="indent1"> So it became a vine and yielded branches </p><p class="indent"> and sent out shoots.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>But there was another great eagle </p><p class="indent"> with great wings and many feathers. </p><p class="indent1"> And behold, this vine bent its roots toward him. </p><p class="indent"> It stretched out its branches to him from its planting bed, </p><p class="indent"> so that he might water it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>It had been planted in good soil </p><p class="indent"> by abundant waters </p><p class="indent1"> in order to yield branches and bear fruit </p><p class="indent"> and become a splendid vine.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So you are to tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Will it flourish? </p><p class="indent"> Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit </p><p class="indent1"> so that it shrivels? </p><p class="indent"> All its foliage will wither! </p><p class="indent1"> It will not take a strong arm or many people </p><p class="indent"> to pull it up by its roots.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Even if it is transplanted, </p><p class="indent"> will it flourish? </p><p class="indent1"> Will it not completely wither when the east wind strikes? </p><p class="indent"> It will wither on the bed where it sprouted.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable Explained</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">12</span>“Now say to this rebellious house: ‘Do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not know what these things mean?’ </p><p class="reg1"> Tell them, ‘Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, carried off its king and officials, and brought them back with him to Babylon.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He took a member of the royal family<span class="fn">c</span>  and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. Then he carried away the leading men of the land,
<span class="reftext">14</span>so that the kingdom would be brought low, unable to lift itself up, surviving only by keeping his covenant.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>But this king rebelled against Babylon by sending his envoys to Egypt to ask for horses and a large army. Will he flourish? Will the one who does such things escape? Can he break a covenant and yet escape?’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>‘As surely as I live,’ declares the Lord GOD, ‘he will die in Babylon, in the land of the king who enthroned him, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Pharaoh with his mighty army and vast horde will not help him in battle, when ramps are built and siege walls constructed to destroy many lives.
<span class="reftext">18</span>He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. Seeing that he gave his hand in pledge yet did all these things, he will not escape!’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘As surely as I live, I will bring down upon his head <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> oath that he despised and <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> covenant that he broke.
<span class="reftext">20</span>I will spread <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> net over him and catch him in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> snare. I will bring him to Babylon and execute <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> upon him there for the treason he committed against <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
<span class="reftext">21</span>All his choice troops<span class="fn">d</span>  will fall by the sword, and those who survive will be scattered to every wind. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will know that I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have spoken.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘I will take a shoot from the lofty top of the cedar, </p><p class="indent"> and I will set it out. </p><p class="indent1"> I will pluck a tender sprig from its topmost shoots, </p><p class="indent"> and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>I will plant it on the mountain heights of Israel </p><p class="indent"> so that it will bear branches; </p><p class="indent1"> it will yield fruit </p><p class="indent"> and become a majestic cedar. </p><p class="indent1"> Birds of every kind will nest under it, </p><p class="indent"> taking shelter in the shade of its branches.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then all the trees of the field will know </p><p class="indent"> that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. </p><p class="indent1"> I bring the tall tree down </p><p class="indent"> and make the low tree tall. </p><p class="indent1"> I dry up the green tree </p><p class="indent"> and make the withered tree flourish. </p><p class="indent1"> I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have spoken, </p><p class="indent"> and I have done it.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Pinions</i> are the outer parts of a bird’s wings, including the flight feathers.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">in a field of seed</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the royal seed</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Many Hebrew manuscripts; MT <i class="calibre6">All his fleeing troops</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
