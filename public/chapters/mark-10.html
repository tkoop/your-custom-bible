<font >Then Jesus left that place and went into
the region of Judea, beyond the Jordan. Again the crowds came to Him
and He taught them, as was His custom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some Pharisees came to test Him. “Is it
lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” they inquired. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >What did Moses
command you?”</font> He replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They answered, “Moses permitted a man to
write his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“Moses
wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart.
However, from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and
female.’ ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother
and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.’ So
they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined
together, let man not separate.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they were back inside the house, the
disciples asked Jesus about this matter. So He told them, <font color="#a80000">“Whoever
divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against
her. And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she
commits adultery.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now people were bringing the little
children to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them, and the
disciples rebuked those who brought them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant
and told them, <font color="#a80000">“Let the little children come
to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such
as these. Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom
of God like a little child will never enter it.”</font> And He took
the children in His arms, placed His hands on them, and blessed them.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Jesus started on His way, a man ran up
and knelt before Him. “Good Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do
to inherit eternal life?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Why do you call
Me good?”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“No one is
good except God alone. You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder,
do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do
not cheat others, honor your father and mother.’”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Teacher,” he replied, “all these I
have kept from my youth.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus looked at him, loved him, and said
to him, <font color="#a80000">“There is one thing you lack: Go,
sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the man was saddened by these words
and went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus looked around and said to His
disciples, <font color="#a80000">“How hard it is for the rich to
enter the kingdom of God!”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the disciples were amazed at His
words. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus said to them again, <font color="#a80000">“Children,
how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the
kingdom of God.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They were even more astonished and said to
one another, “Who then can be saved?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus looked at them and said, <font color="#a80000">“With
man this is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible
with God.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter began to say to Him, “Look, we
have left everything and followed You.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Truly I tell
you,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“no one who has
left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or
fields for My sake and for the gospel will fail to receive a
hundredfold in the present age—houses and brothers and sisters and
mothers and children and fields, along with persecutions—and in the
age to come, eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and
the last will be first.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As they were going up the road to
Jerusalem, Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples were
amazed, but those who followed were afraid. Again Jesus took the
Twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him:
<font color="#a80000">“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the
Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes.
They will condemn Him to death and will deliver Him over to the
Gentiles, who will mock Him and spit on Him and flog Him and kill
Him. And after three days He will rise again.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
came to Jesus and declared, “Teacher, we want You to do for us
whatever we ask.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >What do you want
Me to do for you?”</font> He inquired. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They answered, “Grant that one of us may
sit at Your right hand and the other at Your left in Your glory.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >You do not know
what you are asking,”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“Can
you drink the cup I will drink, or be baptized with the baptism I
will undergo?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >We can,” the brothers answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >You will drink
the cup that I drink,”</font> Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“and
you will be baptized with the baptism that I undergo. But to sit at
My right or left is not Mine to grant. These seats belong to those
for whom they have been prepared.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the ten heard about this, they became
indignant with James and John. So Jesus called them together and
said, <font color="#a80000">“You know that those regarded as rulers
of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors exercise
authority over them. But it shall not be this way among you. Instead,
whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and
whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all. For even the Son
of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life
as a ransom for many.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next, they came to Jericho. And as Jesus
and His disciples were leaving Jericho with a large crowd, a blind
beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting beside the
road. When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry
out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Many people admonished him to be silent,
but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus stopped and said, <font color="#a80000">“Call
him.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they called the blind man. “Take
courage!” they said. “Get up! He is calling for you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Throwing off his cloak, Bartimaeus jumped
up and came to Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >What do you want
Me to do for you?”</font> Jesus asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Rabboni,” said the blind man, “let
me see again.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Go,”</font>
said Jesus, <font color="#a80000">“your faith has healed you.”</font>
And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the
road. </font>
