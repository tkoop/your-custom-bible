Again the crowds came to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> taught them, as was <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> custom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Some Pharisees came to test <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” they inquired.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">3</span>“What did Moses command you?”</span> He replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>They answered, “Moses permitted a man to write his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But Jesus told them, <span>“Moses wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart.
<span class="reftext">6</span>However, from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">7</span>‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">8</span>and the two will become one flesh.’<span class="fn">d</span>  So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>When they were back inside the house, the disciples asked Jesus about this matter.
<span class="reftext">11</span>So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> told them, <span>“Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Blesses the Children<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 19:13–15; Luke 18:15–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Now people were bringing the little children to Jesus for <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> to place <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hands on them, and the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But when Jesus saw this, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was indignant and told them, <span>“Let the little children come to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”</span>
<span class="reftext">16</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> took the children in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> arms, placed <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hands on them, and blessed them.
</p><p class="hdg">The Rich Young Man<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 19:16–30; Luke 18:18–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>As Jesus started on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> way, a man ran up and knelt before <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. “Good <span class='cap'>Teacher</span><span class='nocap'>teacher</span>,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">18</span>“Why do you call <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> good?”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“No one is good except God alone.
<span class="reftext">19</span>You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not cheat others, <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> your father and mother.’<span class="fn">e</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>“Teacher,” he replied, “all these I have kept from my youth.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Jesus looked at him, loved him, and said to him, <span>“There is one thing you lack: Go, sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.<span class="fn">f</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But the man was saddened by these words and went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then Jesus looked around and said to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples, <span>“How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>And the disciples were amazed at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> words. </p><p class="reg1"> But Jesus said to them again, <span>“Children, how hard it is to enter<span class="fn">g</span>  the kingdom of God!
<span class="reftext">25</span>It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>They were even more astonished and said to one another, “Who then can be saved?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Jesus looked at them and said, <span>“With man this is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Peter began to say to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Look, we have left everything and followed <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">29</span>“Truly I tell you,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sake and for the gospel
<span class="reftext">30</span>will fail to receive a hundredfold in the present age—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.
<span class="reftext">31</span>But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Third Prediction of the Passion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 20:17–19; Luke 18:31–34)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>As they were going up the road to Jerusalem, Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples were amazed, but those who followed were afraid. Again Jesus took the <span class='cap'>Twelve</span><span class='nocap'>twelve</span> aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>:
<span class="reftext">33</span><span>“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes. They will condemn <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> to death and will deliver <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> over to the Gentiles,
<span class="reftext">34</span>who will mock <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and spit on <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and flog <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and kill <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. And after three days <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will rise again.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Request of James and John<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 20:20–28)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and declared, “Teacher, we want <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> to do for us whatever we ask.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">36</span>“What do you want <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to do for you?”</span> He inquired.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>They answered, “Grant that one of us may sit at <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> right hand and the other at <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> left in <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> glory.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">38</span>“You do not know what you are asking,”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“Can you drink the cup I will drink, or be baptized with the baptism I will undergo?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>“We can,” the brothers answered. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“You will drink the cup that I drink,”</span> Jesus said, <span>“and you will be baptized with the baptism that I undergo.
<span class="reftext">40</span>But to sit at <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> right or left is not <span class='cap'>Mine</span><span class='nocap'>mine</span> to grant. These seats belong to those for whom<span class="fn">h</span>  they have been prepared.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.
<span class="reftext">42</span>So Jesus called them together and said, <span>“You know that those regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors exercise authority over them.
<span class="reftext">43</span>But it shall not be this way among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
<span class="reftext">44</span>and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all.
<span class="reftext">45</span>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> life as a ransom for many.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals Bartimaeus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 20:29–34; Luke 18:35–43)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>Next, they came to Jericho. And as Jesus and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples were leaving Jericho with a large crowd, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting beside the road.
<span class="reftext">47</span>When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>Many people admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">49</span>Jesus stopped and said, <span>“Call him.”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> So they called the blind man. “Take courage!” they said. “Get up! He is calling for you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>Throwing off his cloak, Bartimaeus jumped up and came to Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">51</span>“What do you want <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to do for you?”</span> Jesus asked. </p><p class="reg1">“Rabboni,” said the blind man, “let me see again.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">52</span>“Go,”</span> said Jesus, <span>“your faith has healed you.”</span> And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> See Deuteronomy 24:1.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Genesis 1:27; Genesis 5:2<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> NE and WH do not include <i class="calibre6">and be united to his wife.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Genesis 2:24 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Exodus 20:12–16; Deuteronomy 5:16–20<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">Then come, take up the cross, and follow Me.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">40</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Mine to grant, but for whom</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
