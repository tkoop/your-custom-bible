linen embroidered with gold, and with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.
They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut threads from them to
interweave with the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine
linen—the work of a skilled craftsman. They made shoulder pieces
for the ephod, which were attached at two of its corners, so it could
be fastened. And the skillfully woven waistband of the ephod was of
one piece with the ephod, of the same workmanship—with gold, with
blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely spun linen, just as
the LORD had commanded Moses. </font>
