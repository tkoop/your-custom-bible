</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“Come,” they said, “let us build for ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens, that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of all the earth.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men were building.
