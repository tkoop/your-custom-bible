</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>The LORD is my strength and my song, </p><p class="indent"> and He has become my salvation. </p><p class="indent1"> He is my God, and I will praise Him, </p><p class="indent"> my father’s God, and I will exalt Him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>The LORD is a warrior, </p><p class="indent"> the LORD is His name.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Pharaoh’s chariots and army </p><p class="indent"> He has cast into the sea; </p><p class="indent1"> the finest of his officers </p><p class="indent"> are drowned in the Red Sea.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The depths have covered them; </p><p class="indent"> they sank there like a stone.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Your right hand, O LORD, </p><p class="indent"> is majestic in power; </p><p class="indent1"> Your right hand, O LORD, </p><p class="indent"> has shattered the enemy.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>You overthrew Your adversaries </p><p class="indent"> by Your great majesty. </p><p class="indent1"> You unleashed Your burning wrath; </p><p class="indent"> it consumed them like stubble.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>At the blast of Your nostrils </p><p class="indent"> the waters piled up; </p><p class="indent1"> like a wall the currents stood firm; </p><p class="indent"> the depths congealed in the heart of the sea.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>The enemy declared, </p><p class="indent">‘I will pursue, I will overtake. </p><p class="indent1"> I will divide the spoils; </p><p class="indent"> I will gorge myself on them. </p><p class="indent1"> I will draw my sword; </p><p class="indent"> my hand will destroy them.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>But You blew with Your breath, </p><p class="indent"> and the sea covered them. </p><p class="indent1"> They sank like lead </p><p class="indent"> in the mighty waters.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>Who among the gods is like You, O LORD? </p><p class="indent"> Who is like You—majestic in holiness, </p><p class="indent1"> revered with praises, </p><p class="indent"> performing wonders?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>You stretched out Your right hand, </p><p class="indent"> and the earth swallowed them up.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>With loving devotion<span class="fn">b</span>  You will lead </p><p class="indent"> the people You have redeemed; </p><p class="indent1"> with Your strength You will guide them </p><p class="indent"> to Your holy dwelling.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>The nations will hear and tremble; </p><p class="indent"> anguish will grip the dwellers of Philistia.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then the chiefs of Edom will be dismayed; </p><p class="indent"> trembling will seize the leaders of Moab; </p><p class="indent1"> those who dwell in Canaan will melt away,
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">16</span>and terror and dread will fall on them. </p><p class="indent1"> By the power of Your arm </p><p class="indent"> they will be as still as a stone </p><p class="indent1"> until Your people pass by, O LORD, </p><p class="indent"> until the people You have bought pass by.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>You will bring them in and plant them </p><p class="indent"> on the mountain of Your inheritance—</p><p class="indent1"> the place, O LORD, You have prepared for Your dwelling, </p><p class="indent"> the sanctuary, O Lord, Your hands have established.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>The LORD will reign forever and ever!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>For when Pharaoh’s horses, chariots, and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them. But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron’s sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Miriam sang back to them: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Sing to the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> for He is highly exalted; </p><p class="indent1"> the horse and rider </p><p class="indent"> He has thrown into the sea.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Waters of Marah</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the Desert of Shur. For three days they walked in the desert without finding water.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And when they came to Marah,<span class="fn">c</span>  they could not drink the water there because it was bitter. (That is why it was named Marah.)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?”
<span class="reftext">25</span>And Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a log. And when he cast it into the waters, they were sweetened. </p><p class="reg1"> There the LORD made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there He tested them,
<span class="reftext">26</span>saying, “If you will listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His eyes, and pay attention to His commands, and keep all His statutes, then I will not bring on you any of the diseases I inflicted on the Egyptians. For I am the LORD who heals you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there by the waters.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Sea of Reeds</i>; also in verse 22<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">chesed</i> are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as <i class="calibre6">loving devotion</i>; the range of meaning includes <i class="calibre6">love</i>, <i class="calibre6">goodness</i>, <i class="calibre6">kindness</i>, <i class="calibre6">faithfulness</i>, and <i class="calibre6">mercy</i>, as well as <i class="calibre6">loyalty to a covenant</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Marah</i> means <i class="calibre6">bitter</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
