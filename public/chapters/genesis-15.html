<font ><b>God’s Covenant with Abram</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After these events, the word of the LORD
came to Abram in a vision: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Do not be afraid, Abram. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I am your shield, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >your very great reward.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Abram replied, “O Lord GOD, what can
You give me, since I remain childless, and the heir of my house is
Eliezer of Damascus?” Abram continued, “Behold, You have given me
no offspring, so a servant in my household will be my heir.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the word of the LORD came to Abram,
saying, “This one will not be your heir, but one who comes from
your own body will be your heir.” And the LORD took him outside and
said, “Now look to the heavens and count the stars, if you are
able.” Then He told him, “So shall your offspring be.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Abram believed the LORD, and it was
credited to him as righteousness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD also told him, “I am the LORD,
who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to
possess.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Abram replied, “Lord GOD, how can I
know that I will possess it?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to him, “Bring Me a
heifer, a goat, and a ram, each three years old, along with a
turtledove and a young pigeon.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Abram brought all these to Him, split
each of them down the middle, and laid the halves opposite each
other. The birds, however, he did not cut in half. And the birds of
prey descended on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. As the
sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and suddenly great
terror and darkness overwhelmed him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for
certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not
their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred
years. But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves, and
afterward they will depart with many possessions. You, however, will
go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a ripe old age. In the
fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the iniquity
of the Amorites is not yet complete.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the sun had set and darkness had
fallen, behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch appeared and
passed between the halves of the carcasses. On that day the LORD made
a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given
this land—from the river of Egypt to the great River Euphrates—
the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites,
Perizzites, Rephaites, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and
Jebusites.” </font>
