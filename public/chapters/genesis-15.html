</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>But Abram replied, “O Lord GOD, what can You give me, since I remain childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”
<span class="reftext">3</span>Abram continued, “Behold, You have given me no offspring, so a servant in my household will be my heir.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Abram, saying, “This one will not be your heir, but one who comes from your own body will be your heir.”
<span class="reftext">5</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> took him outside and said, “Now look to the heavens and count the stars, if you are able.” Then He told him, “So shall your offspring be.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Abram believed <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and it was credited to him as righteousness.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> also told him, “I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.”
</p><p class="hdg">God Confirms His Promise<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 34:1–15; Romans 4:13–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But Abram replied, “Lord GOD, how can I know that I will possess it?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to him, “Bring Me a heifer, a goat, and a ram, each three years old, along with a turtledove and a young pigeon.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So Abram brought all these to Him, split each of them down the middle, and laid the halves opposite each other. The birds, however, he did not cut in half.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the birds of prey descended on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
<span class="reftext">12</span>As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and suddenly great terror and darkness overwhelmed him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will depart with many possessions.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span>You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.
<span class="reftext">16</span>In the fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the halves of the carcasses.
<span class="reftext">18</span>On that day <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land—from the river of Egypt to the great River Euphrates—
<span class="reftext">19</span>the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
<span class="reftext">20</span>Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,
