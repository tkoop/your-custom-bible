<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Paul Sails for Rome</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial<span class="fn">a</span>  Regiment.
<span class="reftext">2</span>We boarded an Adramyttian ship about to sail for ports along the coast of Asia,<span class="fn">b</span>  and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>The next day we landed at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul with consideration, allowing him to visit his friends and receive their care.
<span class="reftext">4</span>After putting out from there, we sailed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And when we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.
<span class="reftext">6</span>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>After sailing slowly for many days, we arrived off Cnidus. When the wind impeded us, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.
<span class="reftext">8</span>After we had moved along the coast with difficulty, we came to a place called <span class='cap'>Fair</span><span class='nocap'>fair</span><span class='bsb'>Fair</span> Havens, near the town of Lasea.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>By now much time had passed, and the voyage had already become dangerous because it was after the <span class='cap'>Fast</span><span class='nocap'>fast</span><span class='bsb'>Fast</span>.<span class="fn">c</span>  So Paul advised them,
<span class="reftext">10</span>“Men, I can see that our voyage will be filled with disaster and great loss, not only to ship and cargo, but to our own lives as well.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But contrary to Paul’s advice, the centurion was persuaded by the pilot and by the owner of the ship.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Since the <span class='spell ca'>harbour</span><span class='spell gb'>harbour</span><span class='spell us'>harbor</span> was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided to sail on, if somehow they could reach Phoenix to winter there. Phoenix was a <span class='spell ca'>harbour</span><span class='spell gb'>harbour</span><span class='spell us'>harbor</span> in Crete facing both southwest and northwest.
</p><p class="hdg">The Storm at Sea<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jonah 1:4–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had their opportunity. So they weighed anchor and sailed along, hugging the coast of Crete.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But it was not long before a cyclone called the Northeaster swept down across the island.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Unable to head into the wind, the ship was caught up. So we gave way and let ourselves be driven along.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Passing to the lee of a small island called Cauda,<span class="fn">d</span>  we barely managed to secure the lifeboat.
<span class="reftext">17</span>After hoisting it up, the crew used ropes to undergird the ship. And fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor<span class="fn">e</span>  and were driven along.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>We were tossed so violently that the next day the men began to jettison the cargo.
<span class="reftext">19</span>On the third day, they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands.
<span class="reftext">20</span>When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the great storm continued to batter us, we abandoned all hope of being saved.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have followed my advice not to sail from Crete. Then you would have averted this disaster and loss.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But now I urge <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to keep up <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> courage, because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will not experience any loss of life, but only of the ship.
<span class="reftext">23</span>For just last night an angel of God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood beside me
<span class="reftext">24</span>and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And look, God has granted you the lives of all who sail with you.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>So take courage, men, for I believe God that it will happen just as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> told me.
<span class="reftext">26</span>However, we must run aground on some island.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Shipwreck</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span><span class='bsb'>Sea</span>.<span class="fn">f</span>  About midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.
<span class="reftext">28</span>They took soundings and found that the water was twenty fathoms deep.<span class="fn">g</span>  Going a little farther, they took another set of soundings that read fifteen fathoms.<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Fearing that we would run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daybreak.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Meanwhile, the sailors attempted to escape from the ship. Pretending to lower anchors from the bow, they let the lifeboat down into the sea.
<span class="reftext">31</span>But Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain with the ship, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> cannot be saved.”
<span class="reftext">32</span>So the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat and set it adrift.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Right up to daybreak, Paul kept urging them all to eat: “Today is your fourteenth day in constant suspense, without taking any food.
<span class="reftext">34</span>So for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> own preservation, I urge <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to eat something, because not a single hair of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> head will be lost.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>After he had said this, Paul took bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.
<span class="reftext">36</span>They were all encouraged and took some food themselves.
<span class="reftext">37</span>In all, there were 276<span class="fn">i</span>  of us on board.
<span class="reftext">38</span>After the men had eaten their fill, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>When daylight came, they did not <span class='spell ca'>recognize</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognize</span> the land, but they sighted a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.
<span class="reftext">40</span>Cutting away the anchors, they left them in the sea as they loosened the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.
<span class="reftext">41</span>But the vessel struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was being broken up by the pounding of the waves.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners so none of them could swim to freedom.
<span class="reftext">43</span>But the centurion, wanting to spare Paul’s life, thwarted their plan. He commanded those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.
<span class="reftext">44</span>The rest were to follow on planks and various parts of the ship. In this way everyone was brought safely to land.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Augustan</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">sail to the places along Asia</i>; Asia was a Roman province in what is now western Turkey. <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> NE, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">Clauda</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the sails</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> The Adriatic Sea referred to an area extending well south of Italy to include the central portion of the Mediterranean Sea.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">20 fathoms</i> is approximately 120 feet or 36.6 meters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">15 fathoms</i> is approximately 90 feet or 27.4 meters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">37</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> WH <i class="calibre6">76</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
