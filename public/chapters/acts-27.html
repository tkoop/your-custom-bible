<font ><b>Paul Sails for Rome</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When it was decided that we would sail for
Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion
named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment. We boarded an
Adramyttian ship about to sail for ports along the coast of Asia, and
we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was
with us. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day we landed at Sidon, and
Julius treated Paul with consideration, allowing him to visit his
friends and receive their care. After putting out from there, we
sailed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us. And
when we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and
Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia. There the centurion found an
Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After sailing slowly for many days, we
arrived off Cnidus. When the wind impeded us, we sailed to the lee of
Crete, opposite Salmone. After we had moved along the coast with
difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of
Lasea. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >By now much time had passed, and the
voyage had already become dangerous because it was after the Fast. So
Paul advised them, “Men, I can see that our voyage will be filled
with disaster and great loss, not only to ship and cargo, but to our
own lives as well.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But contrary to Paul’s advice, the
centurion was persuaded by the pilot and by the owner of the ship.
Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided to
sail on, if somehow they could reach Phoenix to winter there. Phoenix
was a harbor in Crete facing both southwest and northwest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When a gentle south wind began to blow,
they thought they had their opportunity. So they weighed anchor and
sailed along, hugging the coast of Crete. But it was not long before
a cyclone called the Northeaster swept down across the island. Unable
to head into the wind, the ship was caught up. So we gave way and let
ourselves be driven along. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Passing to the lee of a small island
called Cauda, we barely managed to secure the lifeboat. After
hoisting it up, the crew used ropes to undergird the ship. And
fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they
lowered the sea anchor and were driven along. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We were tossed so violently that the next
day the men began to jettison the cargo. On the third day, they threw
the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands. When neither sun
nor stars appeared for many days and the great storm continued to
batter us, we abandoned all hope of being saved. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After the men had gone a long time without
food, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have
followed my advice not to sail from Crete. Then you would have
averted this disaster and loss. But now I urge you to keep up your
courage, because you will not experience any loss of life, but only
of the ship. For just last night an angel of God, whose I am and whom
I serve, stood beside me and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you
must stand before Caesar. And look, God has granted you the lives of
all who sail with you.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So take courage, men, for I believe God
that it will happen just as He told me. However, we must run aground
on some island.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the fourteenth night we were still
being driven across the Adriatic Sea. About midnight the sailors
sensed they were approaching land. They took soundings and found that
the water was twenty fathoms deep. Going a little farther, they took
another set of soundings that read fifteen fathoms. Fearing that we
would run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the
stern and prayed for daybreak. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, the sailors attempted to escape
from the ship. Pretending to lower anchors from the bow, they let the
lifeboat down into the sea. But Paul said to the centurion and the
soldiers, “Unless these men remain with the ship, you cannot be
saved.” So the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat and set it
adrift. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Right up to daybreak, Paul kept urging
them all to eat: “Today is your fourteenth day in constant
suspense, without taking any food. So for your own preservation, I
urge you to eat something, because not a single hair of your head
will be lost.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After he had said this, Paul took bread
and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and
began to eat. They were all encouraged and took some food themselves.
In all, there were 276 of us on board. After the men had eaten their
fill, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When daylight came, they did not recognize
the land, but they sighted a bay with a sandy beach, where they
decided to run the ship aground if they could. Cutting away the
anchors, they left them in the sea as they loosened the ropes that
held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made
for the beach. But the vessel struck a sandbar and ran aground. The
bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was being broken up
by the pounding of the waves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners
so none of them could swim to freedom. But the centurion, wanting to
spare Paul’s life, thwarted their plan. He commanded those who
could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. The rest were to
follow on planks and various parts of the ship. In this way everyone
was brought safely to land. </font>
