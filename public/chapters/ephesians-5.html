<font >But among you, as is proper among the
saints, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any
kind of impurity, or of greed. Nor should there be obscenity, foolish
talk, or crude joking, which are out of character, but rather
thanksgiving. For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure, or
greedy person (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the
kingdom of Christ and of God. </font>

<font >Have no fellowship with the fruitless
deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. For it is shameful even to
mention what the disobedient do in secret. But everything exposed by
the light becomes visible, for everything that is illuminated becomes

everything. </font>

Christ and the church. Nevertheless, each one of you also must love
his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband. </font>
