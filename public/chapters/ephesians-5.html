<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Imitators of God</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Be imitators of God, therefore, as beloved children,
<span class="reftext">2</span>and walk in love, just as Christ loved us<span class="fn">a</span>  and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant sacrificial offering to God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But among you, as is proper among the saints, there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or crude joking, which are out of character, but rather thanksgiving.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure, or greedy person (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore do not be partakers with them.
</p><p class="hdg">Children of Light</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,
<span class="reftext">9</span>for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Test and prove what pleases the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Have no fellowship with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
<span class="reftext">12</span>For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.
<span class="reftext">13</span>But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,<span class="fn">b</span>  for everything that is illuminated becomes a light itself.
<span class="reftext">14</span>So it is said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Wake up, O sleeper, </p><p class="indent"> rise up from the dead, </p><p class="indent"> and Christ will shine on you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Pay careful attention, then, to how you walk, not as unwise but as wise,
<span class="reftext">16</span>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless indiscretion. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Speak to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your hearts to the Lord,
<span class="reftext">20</span>always giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</p><p class="hdg">Wives and Husbands<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Song of Solomon 1:1–17; 1 Peter 3:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
<span class="reftext">23</span>For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, His body, of which He is the Savior.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her
<span class="reftext">26</span>to sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,
<span class="reftext">27</span>and to present her to Himself as a glorious church, without stain or wrinkle or any such blemish, but holy and blameless.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Indeed, no one ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church.
<span class="reftext">30</span>For we are members of His body.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">32</span>This mystery is profound, but I am speaking about Christ and the church.
<span class="reftext">33</span>Nevertheless, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> NE and WH <i class="calibre6">Christ loved you</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> SBL begins verse 14 after <i class="calibre6">visible,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the fear of Christ.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">—of His flesh and of His bones</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Genesis 2:24 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
