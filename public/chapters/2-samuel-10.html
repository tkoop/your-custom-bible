<font ><b>David’s Messengers Disgraced</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some time later, the king of the Ammonites
died and was succeeded by his son Hanun. And David said, “I will
show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed
kindness to me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David sent some of his servants to
console Hanun concerning his father. But when they arrived in the
land of the Ammonites, the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun
their lord, “Just because David has sent you comforters, do you
really believe he is showing respect for your father? Has not David
instead sent his servants to explore the city, spy it out, and
overthrow it?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved
off half of each man’s beard, cut off their garments at the hips,
and sent them away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When this was reported to David, he sent
messengers to meet the men, since they had been thoroughly
humiliated. The king told them, “Stay in Jericho until your beards
have grown back, and then return.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Ammonites realized that they had
become a stench to David, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot
soldiers from Beth-rehob and Zoba, as well as a thousand men from the
king of Maacah and twelve thousand men from Tob. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On hearing this, David sent Joab and the
entire army of mighty men. The Ammonites marched out and arrayed
themselves for battle at the entrance of the city gate, while the
Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by
themselves in the open country. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Joab saw the battle lines before him
and behind him, he selected some of the best men of Israel and
arrayed them against the Arameans. And he placed the rest of the
forces under the command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them
against the Ammonites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >If the Arameans are too strong for me,”
said Joab, “then you will come to my rescue. And if the Ammonites
are too strong for you, then I will come to your rescue. Be strong
and let us fight bravely for our people and for the cities of our
God. May the LORD do what is good in His sight.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Joab and his troops advanced to fight
the Arameans, who fled before him. When the Ammonites saw that the
Arameans had fled, they too fled before Abishai, and they entered the
city. So Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came
to Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Arameans saw that they had been
defeated by Israel, they regrouped. Hadadezer sent messengers to
bring more Arameans from beyond the Euphrates, and they came to Helam
with Shobach the commander of Hadadezer’s army leading them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When this was reported to David, he
gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, and went to Helam. Then the
Arameans arrayed themselves against David and fought against him. But
the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred
charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also struck down
Shobach the commander of their army, who died there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When all the kings who were subject to
Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace
with Israel and became subject to them. So the Arameans were afraid
to help the Ammonites anymore. </font>
