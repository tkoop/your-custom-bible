<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Gabriel Interprets Daniel’s Vision</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the third year of the reign of King
Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, subsequent to the one
that had appeared to me earlier. And in the vision I saw myself in
the citadel of Susa, in the province of Elam. I saw in the vision
that I was beside the Ulai Canal. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I lifted up my eyes and saw a ram
with two horns standing beside the canal. The horns were long, but
one was longer than the other, and the longer one grew up later. I
saw the ram charging toward the west and the north and the south. No
animal could stand against him, and there was no deliverance from his
power. He did as he pleased and became great. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As I was contemplating all this, suddenly
a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came out of the west,
crossing the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground.
He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the
canal and rushed at him with furious power. I saw him approach the
ram in a rage against him, and he struck the ram and shattered his
two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against him, and the goat
threw him to the ground and trampled him, and no one could deliver
the ram from his power. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Thus the goat became very great, but at
the height of his power, his large horn was broken off, and four
prominent horns came up in its place, pointing toward the four winds
of heaven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">From one of these horns a little horn
emerged and grew extensively toward the south and the east and toward
the Beautiful Land. It grew as high as the host of heaven, and it
cast down some of the host and some of the stars to the earth, and
trampled them. It magnified itself, even to the Prince of the host;
it removed His daily sacrifice and overthrew the place of His
sanctuary. And in the rebellion, the host and the daily sacrifice
were given over to the horn, and it flung truth to the ground and
prospered in whatever it did. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I heard a holy one speaking, and
another holy one said to him, “How long until the fulfillment of
the vision of the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes
desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host to be
trampled?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He said to me, “It will take 2,300
evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be properly restored.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While I, Daniel, was watching the vision
and trying to understand it, there stood before me one having the
appearance of a man. And I heard the voice of a man calling from
between the banks of the Ulai: “Gabriel, explain the vision to this
man.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As he came near to where I stood, I was
terrified and fell facedown. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Son of man,” he said to me,
“understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While he was speaking with me, I fell into
a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then he touched me, helped me to my feet,
and said, “Behold, I will make known to you what will happen in the
latter time of wrath, because it concerns the appointed time of the
end. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The two-horned ram that you saw represents
the kings of Media and Persia. The shaggy goat represents the king of
Greece, and the large horn between his eyes is the first king. The
four horns that replaced the broken one represent four kingdoms that
will rise from that nation, but will not have the same power. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the latter part of their reign, when
the rebellion has reached its full measure, an insolent king, skilled
in intrigue, will come to the throne. His power will be great, but it
will not be his own. He will cause terrible destruction and succeed
in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men along with the
holy people. Through his craft and by his hand, he will cause deceit
to prosper, and in his own mind he will make himself great. In a time
of peace he will destroy many, and he will even stand against the
Prince of princes. Yet he will be broken off, but not by human hands.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The vision of the evenings and the
mornings that has been spoken is true. Now you must seal up the
vision, for it concerns the distant future.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for
days. Then I got up and went about the king’s business. I was
confounded by the vision; it was beyond understanding. </font>
