<font ><b>Joash Repairs the Temple</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash became
king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother’s name
was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba. And Joash did what was right in
the eyes of the LORD all the days he was instructed by Jehoiada the
priest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, the high places were not
removed; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Joash said to the priests, “Collect
all the money brought as sacred gifts into the house of the LORD—the
census money, the money from vows, and the money brought voluntarily
into the house of the LORD. Let every priest receive it from his
constituency, and let it be used to repair any damage found in the
temple.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >By the twenty-third year of the reign of
Joash, however, the priests had not yet repaired the damage to the
temple. So King Joash called Jehoiada and the other priests and said,
“Why have you not repaired the damage to the temple? Now,
therefore, take no more money from your constituency, but hand it
over for the repair of the temple.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the priests agreed that they would not
receive money from the people and that they would not repair the
temple themselves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehoiada the priest took a chest,
bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar on the right
side as one enters the house of the LORD. There the priests who
guarded the threshold put all the money brought into the house of the
LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Whenever they saw that there was a large
amount of money in the chest, the royal scribe and the high priest
would go up, count the money brought into the house of the LORD, and
tie it up in bags. Then they would put the counted money into the
hands of those who supervised the work on the house of the LORD, who
in turn would pay those doing the work—the carpenters, builders,
masons, and stonecutters. They also purchased timber and dressed
stone to repair the damage to the house of the LORD, and they paid
the other expenses of the temple repairs. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >However, the money brought into the house
of the LORD was not used for making silver basins, wick trimmers,
sprinkling bowls, trumpets, or any articles of gold or silver for the
house of the LORD. Instead, it was paid to those doing the work, and
with it they repaired the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >No accounting was required from the men
who received the money to pay the workmen, because they acted with
integrity. The money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings was
not brought into the house of the LORD; it belonged to the priests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Hazael king of Aram marched
up and fought against Gath and captured it. Then he decided to attack
Jerusalem. So King Joash of Judah took all the sacred objects
dedicated by his fathers—Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, the
kings of Judah—along with his own consecrated items and all the
gold found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the royal
palace, and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram. So Hazael withdrew
from Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Joash,
along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book
of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the servants of Joash rose up and
formed a conspiracy and killed him at Beth-millo, on the road down to
Silla. His servants Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of
Shomer struck him down, and he died. And they buried him with his
fathers in the City of David, and his son Amaziah reigned in his
place. </font>
