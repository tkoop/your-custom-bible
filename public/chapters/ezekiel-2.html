“<font >Son of man,” He said to me, “stand
up on your feet and I will speak to you.” And as He spoke to me,
the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and I heard Him speaking
to me. </font>

“<font >Son of man,” He said to me, “I am
sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has
rebelled against Me. To this very day they and their fathers have
rebelled against Me. They are obstinate and stubborn children. I am
sending you to them, and you are to say to them, ‘This is what the
Lord GOD says.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And whether they listen or refuse to
listen—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a
prophet has been among them. </font>

<font >But you, son of man, do not be afraid of
them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns
surround you, and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be afraid of
their words or dismayed by their presence, though they are a
rebellious house. But speak My words to them, whether they listen or
refuse to listen, for they are rebellious. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you, son of man, listen to what I tell
you. Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth
and eat what I give you.” </font>

<font >Then I looked and saw a hand reaching out
to me, and in it was a scroll, which He unrolled before me. And
written on the front and back of it were words of lamentation,
mourning, and woe. </font>
