</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan,<span class="fn">m</span>  and Jaddua, during the reign of Darius the Persian, the heads of the families of the Levites and priests were recorded.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>As for the descendants of Levi, the family heads up to the days of Johanan son of Eliashib were recorded in the Book of the Chronicles.<span class="fn">n</span> 
<span class="reftext">24</span>The leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel,<span class="fn">o</span>  along with their associates, who stood across from them to give praise and thanksgiving as one section alternated with the other, as prescribed by David the man of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.
<span class="reftext">26</span>They served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak,<span class="fn">p</span>  and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe.
</p><p class="hdg">The Dedication of the Wall</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from all their homes and brought to Jerusalem to celebrate the joyous dedication with thanksgiving and singing, accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres.
<span class="reftext">28</span>The singers were also assembled from the region around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites,
<span class="reftext">29</span>from Beth-gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for they had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">30</span>After the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall, and I appointed two great thanksgiving choirs. One was to proceed along the top of the wall<span class="fn">q</span>  to the right, toward the Dung Gate.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed,
<span class="reftext">33</span>along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
<span class="reftext">34</span>Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
<span class="reftext">35</span>and some of the priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah,<span class="fn">r</span>  the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,
<span class="reftext">36</span>and his associates—Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani—with the musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the scribe led the procession.
<span class="reftext">37</span>At the Fountain Gate they climbed the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>The second thanksgiving choir proceeded to the left, and I followed it with half the people along the top of the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,
<span class="reftext">39</span>over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah Gate,<span class="fn">s</span>  the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. And they stopped at the Gate of the Guard.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>The two thanksgiving choirs then stood in the house of God, as did I, along with the half of the officials accompanying me,
<span class="reftext">41</span>as well as the priests with their trumpets—Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah—
<span class="reftext">42</span>and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. Then the choirs sang out under the direction of Jezrahiah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>On that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from afar.
</p><p class="hdg">Provisions for Temple Worship</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>And on that same day men were appointed over the rooms that housed the supplies, contributions, firstfruits, and tithes. The portions specified by the Law for the priests and Levites were gathered into these storerooms from the fields of the villages, because Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who were serving.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers, as David and his son Solomon had prescribed.
<span class="reftext">46</span>For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there were directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>So in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside daily portions for the Levites, and the Levites set aside daily portions for the descendants of Aaron.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt;
