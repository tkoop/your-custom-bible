<font >In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan,

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the descendants of Levi, the family
heads up to the days of Johanan son of Eliashib were recorded in the
Book of the Chronicles. The leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah,
Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, along with their associates,
who stood across from them to give praise and thanksgiving as one
section alternated with the other, as prescribed by David the man of
God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam,
Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the
gates. They served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, the son of
Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest
and scribe. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At the dedication of the wall of
Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from all their homes and
brought to Jerusalem to celebrate the joyous dedication with
thanksgiving and singing, accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres.
The singers were also assembled from the region around Jerusalem,
from the villages of the Netophathites, from Beth-gilgal, and from
the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for they had built villages for
themselves around Jerusalem. After the priests and Levites had
purified themselves, they purified the people, the gates, and the
wall. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I brought the leaders of Judah up on
the wall, and I appointed two great thanksgiving choirs. One was to
proceed along the top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate.
Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed, along with Azariah,
Ezra, Meshullam, Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, and some of the
priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of
Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of
Zaccur, the son of Asaph, and his associates—Shemaiah, Azarel,
Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani—with the
musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the
scribe led the procession. At the Fountain Gate they climbed the
steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above
the house of David to the Water Gate on the east. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The second thanksgiving choir proceeded to
the left, and I followed it with half the people along the top of the
wall, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, over the Gate of
Ephraim, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and
the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. And they stopped
at the Gate of the Guard. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The two thanksgiving choirs then stood in
the house of God, as did I, along with the half of the officials
accompanying me, as well as the priests with their trumpets—Eliakim,
Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah— and
also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam,
and Ezer. Then the choirs sang out under the direction of Jezrahiah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On that day they offered great sacrifices,
rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and
children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from
afar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And on that same day men were appointed
over the rooms that housed the supplies, contributions, firstfruits,
and tithes. The portions specified by the Law for the priests and
Levites were gathered into these storerooms from the fields of the
villages, because Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who
were serving. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They performed the service of their God
and the service of purification, along with the singers and
gatekeepers, as David and his son Solomon had prescribed. For long
ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there were directors for the
singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah,
all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and
gatekeepers. They also set aside daily portions for the Levites, and
the Levites set aside daily portions for the descendants of Aaron. </font>
