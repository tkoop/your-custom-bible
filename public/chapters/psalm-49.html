<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Evanescence of Wealth<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Ecclesiastes 5:8–20)</span></p><p class="pshdg"><span class="reftext"></span>For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. </p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>Hear this, all you peoples; </p><p class="indent"> listen, all inhabitants of the world,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>both low and high, </p><p class="indent"> rich and poor alike.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>My mouth will impart wisdom, </p><p class="indent"> and the meditation of my heart will bring understanding.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I will incline my ear to a proverb; </p><p class="indent"> I will express my riddle with the harp:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Why should I fear in times of trouble, </p><p class="indent"> when wicked usurpers surround me?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>They trust in their wealth </p><p class="indent"> and boast in their great riches.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>No man can possibly redeem his brother<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> or pay his ransom to God.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>For the redemption of his soul is costly, </p><p class="indent"> and never can payment suffice,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>that he should live on forever </p><p class="indent"> and not see decay.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>For it is clear that wise men die, </p><p class="indent"> and the foolish and the senseless both perish </p><p class="indent"> and leave their wealth to others.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Their graves<span class="fn">b</span>  are their eternal homes—</p><p class="indent"> their dwellings for endless generations—</p><p class="indent"> even though their lands were their namesakes.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But a man, despite his wealth, cannot endure; </p><p class="indent"> he is like the beasts that perish.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>This is the fate of the self-confident<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and their followers who endorse their sayings. </p><p class="selah"> Selah
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Like sheep they are destined for Sheol. </p><p class="indent"> Death will be their shepherd. </p><p class="indent1"> The upright will rule them in the morning, </p><p class="indent"> and their form will decay in Sheol, </p><p class="indent"> far from their lofty abode.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>But God will redeem my life from Sheol, </p><p class="indent"> for He will surely take me to Himself. </p><p class="selah"> Selah
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Do not be amazed when a man grows rich, </p><p class="indent"> when the splendour of his house increases.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>For when he dies, he will carry nothing away; </p><p class="indent"> his abundance will not follow him down.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Though in his lifetime he blesses his soul—</p><p class="indent"> and men praise you when you prosper—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>he will join the generation of his fathers, </p><p class="indent"> who will never see the light of day.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>A man who has riches without understanding </p><p class="indent"> is like the beasts that perish.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">redeem another</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> LXX, Syriac, and Aramaic Targum; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Their inward thoughts</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the way of the foolish</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
