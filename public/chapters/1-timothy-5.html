<font ><b>Honoring Widows and Elders</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not rebuke an older man, but appeal to
him as to a father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Treat younger men as brothers, older women
as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Honor the widows who are truly widows. But
if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to
show godliness to their own family and repay their parents, for this
is pleasing in the sight of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The widow who is truly in need and left
all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day in her
petitions and prayers. But she who lives for pleasure is dead even
while she is still alive. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Give these instructions to the believers,
so that they will be above reproach. If anyone does not provide for
his own, and especially his own household, he has denied the faith
and is worse than an unbeliever. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A widow should be enrolled if she is at
least sixty years old, the wife of one man, and well known for good
deeds such as bringing up children, entertaining strangers, washing
the feet of the saints, imparting relief to the afflicted, and
devoting herself to every good work. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But refuse to enroll younger widows. For
when their passions draw them away from Christ, they will want to
marry, and thus will incur judgment because they are setting aside
their first faith. At the same time they will also learn to be idle,
going from house to house and being not only idle, but also gossips
and busybodies, discussing things they should not mention. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I advise the younger widows to marry,
have children, and manage their households, denying the adversary
occasion for slander. For some have already turned aside to follow
Satan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If any believing woman has dependent
widows, she must assist them and not allow the church to be burdened,
so that it can help the widows who are truly in need. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Elders who lead effectively are worthy of
double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and
teaching. For the Scripture says, “Do not muzzle an ox while it is
treading out the grain,” and, “The worker is worthy of his
wages.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not entertain an accusation against an
elder, except on the testimony of two or three witnesses. But those
who persist in sin should be rebuked in front of everyone, so that
the others will stand in fear of sin. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I solemnly charge you before God and
Christ Jesus and the elect angels to maintain these principles
without bias, and to do nothing out of partiality. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not be too quick in the laying on of
hands and thereby share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Stop drinking only water and use a little
wine instead, because of your stomach and your frequent ailments. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The sins of some men are obvious, going
ahead of them to judgment; but the sins of others do not surface
until later. In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even the
ones that are inconspicuous cannot remain hidden. </font>
