<span class="reftext">4</span>But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to show godliness to their own family and repay their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The widow who is truly in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day in her petitions and prayers.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But she who lives for pleasure is dead even while she is still alive.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But refuse to <span class='spell ca'>enrol</span><span class='spell gb'>enrol</span><span class='spell us'>enroll</span> younger widows. For when their passions draw them away from Christ, they will want to marry,

<span class="reftext">13</span>At the same time they will also learn to be idle, going from house to house and being not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, discussing things they should not mention.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So I advise the younger widows to marry, have children, and manage their households, denying the adversary occasion for slander.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For some have already turned aside to follow Satan.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>If any believing woman has dependent widows, she must assist them and not allow the church to be burdened, so that it can help the widows who are truly in need.
