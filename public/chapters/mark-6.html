<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Rejection at Nazareth<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 13:53–58; Luke 4:16–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Jesus went on from there and came to His hometown, accompanied by His disciples.
<span class="reftext">2</span>When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard Him were astonished. “Where did this man get these ideas?” they asked. “What is this wisdom He has been given? And how can He perform such miracles?
<span class="reftext">3</span>Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joses,<span class="fn">a</span>  Judas, and Simon? Aren’t His sisters here with us as well?” And they took offence at Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span>“Only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household is a prophet without honour.”</span>
<span class="reftext">5</span>So He could not perform any miracles there, except to lay His hands on a few of the sick and heal them.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And He was amazed at their unbelief. </p><p class="reg1"> And He went around from village to village, teaching the people.
</p><p class="hdg">The Ministry of the Twelve<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 10:5–15; Luke 9:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then Jesus called the Twelve to Him and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.
<span class="reftext">8</span>He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey—no bread, no bag, no money<span class="fn">b</span>  in their belts—
<span class="reftext">9</span>and to wear sandals, but not a second tunic.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And He told them, <span>“When you enter a house, stay there until you leave that area.
<span class="reftext">11</span>If anyone will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that place, as a testimony against them.”</span><span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So they set out and preached that the people should repent.
<span class="reftext">13</span>They also drove out many demons and healed many of the sick, anointing them with oil.
</p><p class="hdg">The Beheading of John<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 14:1–12; Luke 9:7–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Now King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known, and people were saying,<span class="fn">d</span>  “John the Baptist has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
<span class="reftext">15</span>Others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and still others, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has risen from the dead!”
<span class="reftext">17</span>For Herod himself had ordered that John be arrested and bound and imprisoned, on account of his brother Philip’s wife Herodias, whom Herod had married.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she had been unable,
<span class="reftext">20</span>because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard John’s words, he was greatly perplexed; yet he listened to him gladly.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>On Herod’s birthday, her opportunity arose. Herod held a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
<span class="reftext">22</span>When the daughter of Herodias<span class="fn">e</span>  came and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests, and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.”
<span class="reftext">23</span>And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then she went out and asked her mother, “What should I request?” </p><p class="reg1"> And her mother answered, “The head of John the Baptist.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>At once the girl hurried back to the king with her request: “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>The king was consumed with sorrow, but because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her.
<span class="reftext">27</span>So without delay, the king commanded that John’s head be brought in. He sent an executioner, who went and beheaded him in the prison.
<span class="reftext">28</span>The man brought John’s head on a platter and presented it to the girl, who gave it to her mother.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>When John’s disciples heard about this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb.
</p><p class="hdg">The Feeding of the Five Thousand<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 14:13–21; Luke 9:10–17; John 6:1–15)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Meanwhile, the apostles gathered around Jesus and brought Him news of all they had done and taught.
<span class="reftext">31</span>And He said to them, <span>“Come with Me privately to a solitary place, and let us rest for a while.”</span> For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>So they went away in a boat by themselves to a solitary place.
<span class="reftext">33</span>But many people saw them leaving and recognized them. They ran together on foot from all the towns and arrived before them.
<span class="reftext">34</span>When Jesus stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>By now the hour was already late. So the disciples came to Jesus and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>But Jesus told them, <span>“You give them something to eat.”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> They asked Him, “Should we go out and spend two hundred denarii<span class="fn">f</span>  to give all of them bread to eat?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">38</span>“Go and see how many loaves you have,”</span> He told them. </p><p class="reg1"> And after checking, they said, “Five—and two fish.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Then Jesus directed them to have the people sit in groups on the green grass.
<span class="reftext">40</span>So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke the loaves. Then He gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And He divided the two fish among them all.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>They all ate and were satisfied,
<span class="reftext">43</span>and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.
<span class="reftext">44</span>And there were five thousand men who had eaten the loaves.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Walks on Water<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 14:22–33; John 6:16–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>Immediately Jesus made His disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd.
<span class="reftext">46</span>After bidding them farewell, He went up on the mountain to pray.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and Jesus was alone on land.
<span class="reftext">48</span>He could see that the disciples were straining to row, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night,<span class="fn">g</span>  Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea. He intended to pass by them,
<span class="reftext">49</span>but when they saw Him walking on the sea, they cried out, thinking He was a ghost—
<span class="reftext">50</span>for they all saw Him and were terrified. </p><p class="reg1"> But Jesus spoke up at once: <span>“Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”</span>
<span class="reftext">51</span>Then He climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. And the disciples were utterly astounded,
<span class="reftext">52</span>for they had not understood about the loaves, but their hearts had been hardened.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals at Gennesaret<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 14:34–36)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">53</span>When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and moored the boat.
<span class="reftext">54</span>As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus
<span class="reftext">55</span>and ran through that whole region, carrying the sick on mats to wherever they heard He was.
<span class="reftext">56</span>And wherever He went—villages and towns and countrysides—they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Joses</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Joseph</i>; see Matthew 13:55.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">copper coins</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">Truly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town</i>; see Matthew 10:15.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">they were saying</i>; some manuscripts <i class="calibre6">he was saying</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Some early manuscripts <i class="calibre6">When his daughter Herodias</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">37</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> A denarius was customarily a day’s wage for a labourer; see Matthew 20:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">48</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> That is, between three and six in the morning<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
