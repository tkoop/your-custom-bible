<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a><span class="reftext">2</span>When the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard Him were astonished. “Where did this man get these ideas?” they asked. “What is this wisdom He has been given?

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span>“Only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household is a prophet without honor.”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a><span class="reftext">5</span>So He could not perform any miracles there, except to lay His hands on a few of the sick and heal them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a><span class="reftext">6</span>And He was amazed at their unbelief. </p><p class="reg1"> And He went around from village to village, teaching the people.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a><span class="reftext">8</span>He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the journey—no bread, no bag, no money<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">b</a></span>  in their belts—
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a><span class="reftext">9</span>and to wear sandals, but not a second tunic.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And He told them, <span>“When you enter a house, stay there until you leave that area.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So they set out and preached that the people should repent.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a><span class="reftext">13</span>They also drove out many demons and healed many of the sick, anointing them with oil.

That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a><span class="reftext">15</span>Others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and still others, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has risen from the dead!”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a><span class="reftext">17</span>For Herod himself had ordered that John be arrested and bound and imprisoned, on account of his brother Philip’s wife Herodias, whom Herod had married.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a><span class="reftext">18</span>For John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife!”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So Herodias held a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she had been unable,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a><span class="reftext">20</span>because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard John’s words, he was greatly perplexed; yet he listened to him gladly.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="21"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>On Herod’s birthday, her opportunity arose. Herod held a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="23"></a><span class="reftext">23</span>And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom!”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="24"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then she went out and asked her mother, “What should I request?” </p><p class="reg1"> And her mother answered, “The head of John the Baptist.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>At once the girl hurried back to the king with her request: “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="26"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>The king was consumed with sorrow, but because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="27"></a><span class="reftext">27</span>So without delay, the king commanded that John’s head be brought in. He sent an executioner, who went and beheaded him in the prison.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="28"></a><span class="reftext">28</span>The man brought John’s head on a platter and presented it to the girl, who gave it to her mother.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="29"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>When John’s disciples heard about this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="31"></a><span class="reftext">31</span>And He said to them, <span>“Come with Me privately to a solitary place, and let us rest for a while.”</span> For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="32"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>So they went away in a boat by themselves to a solitary place.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="33"></a><span class="reftext">33</span>But many people saw them leaving and recognized them. They ran together on foot from all the towns and arrived before them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="34"></a><span class="reftext">34</span>When Jesus stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="35"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>By now the hour was already late. So the disciples came to Jesus and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="37"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>But Jesus told them, <span>“You give them something to eat.”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> They asked Him, “Should we go out and spend two hundred denarii<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">f</a></span>  to give all of them bread to eat?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="38"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">38</span>“Go and see how many loaves you have,”</span> He told them. </p><p class="reg1"> And after checking, they said, “Five—and two fish.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="39"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Then Jesus directed them to have the people sit in groups on the green grass.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="40"></a><span class="reftext">40</span>So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="41"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke the loaves.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="42"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>They all ate and were satisfied,

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="44"></a><span class="reftext">44</span>And there were five thousand men who had eaten the loaves.
