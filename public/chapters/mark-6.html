<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Beheading of John</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus went on from there and came to His
hometown, accompanied by His disciples. When the Sabbath came, He
began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard Him were
astonished. “Where did this man get these ideas?” they asked.
“What is this wisdom He has been given? And how can He perform such
miracles? Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother
of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Aren’t His sisters here with us
as well?” And they took offense at Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Only
in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household is a
prophet without honor.”</font> So He could not perform any miracles
there, except to lay His hands on a few of the sick and heal them.
And He was amazed at their unbelief. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And He went around from village to
village, teaching the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus called the Twelve to Him and
began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean
spirits. He instructed them to take nothing but a staff for the
journey—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts— and to wear
sandals, but not a second tunic. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And He told them, <font color="#a80000">“When
you enter a house, stay there until you leave that area. If anyone
will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet
when you leave that place, as a testimony against them.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they set out and preached that the
people should repent. They also drove out many demons and healed many
of the sick, anointing them with oil. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now King Herod heard about this, for
Jesus’ name had become well known, and people were saying, “John
the Baptist has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers
are at work in him.” Others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and
still others, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when Herod heard this, he said, “John,
whom I beheaded, has risen from the dead!” For Herod himself had
ordered that John be arrested and bound and imprisoned, on account of
his brother Philip’s wife Herodias, whom Herod had married. For
John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your
brother’s wife!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Herodias held a grudge against John and
wanted to kill him. But she had been unable, because Herod feared
John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man.
When he heard John’s words, he was greatly perplexed; yet he
listened to him gladly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On Herod’s birthday, her opportunity
arose. Herod held a banquet for his nobles and military commanders
and the leading men of Galilee. When the daughter of Herodias came
and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests, and the king said to
the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to
you.” And he swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give
you, up to half my kingdom!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then she went out and asked her mother,
“What should I request?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And her mother answered, “The head of
John the Baptist.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At once the girl hurried back to the king
with her request: “I want you to give me the head of John the
Baptist on a platter immediately.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king was consumed with sorrow, but
because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her.
So without delay, the king commanded that John’s head be brought
in. He sent an executioner, who went and beheaded him in the prison.
The man brought John’s head on a platter and presented it to the
girl, who gave it to her mother. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When John’s disciples heard about this,
they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile, the apostles gathered around
Jesus and brought Him news of all they had done and taught. And He
said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Come with Me privately to a
solitary place, and let us rest for a while.”</font> For many
people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they went away in a boat by themselves
to a solitary place. But many people saw them leaving and recognized
them. They ran together on foot from all the towns and arrived before
them. When Jesus stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had
compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd.
And He began to teach them many things. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By now the hour was already late. So the
disciples came to Jesus and said, “This is a desolate place, and
the hour is already late. Dismiss the crowd so they can go to the
surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to
eat.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“You
give them something to eat.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They asked Him, “Should we go out and
spend two hundred denarii to give all of them bread to eat?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go and see how
many loaves you have,”</font> He told them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And after checking, they said, “Five—and
two fish.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus directed them to have the
people sit in groups on the green grass. So they sat down in groups
of hundreds and fifties. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Taking the five loaves and the two fish
and looking up to heaven, Jesus spoke a blessing and broke the
loaves. Then He gave them to His disciples to set before the people.
And He divided the two fish among them all. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They all ate and were satisfied, and the
disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and
fish. And there were five thousand men who had eaten the loaves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Immediately Jesus made His disciples get
into the boat and go on ahead of Him to Bethsaida, while He dismissed
the crowd. After bidding them farewell, He went up on the mountain to
pray. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When evening came, the boat was in the
middle of the sea, and Jesus was alone on land. He could see that the
disciples were straining to row, because the wind was against them.
About the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking
on the sea. He intended to pass by them, but when they saw Him
walking on the sea, they cried out, thinking He was a ghost— for
they all saw Him and were terrified. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus spoke up at once: <font color="#a80000">“Take
courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”</font> Then He climbed into
the boat with them, and the wind died down. And the disciples were
utterly astounded, for they had not understood about the loaves, but
their hearts had been hardened. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When they had crossed over, they landed at
Gennesaret and moored the boat. As soon as they got out of the boat,
the people recognized Jesus and ran through that whole region,
carrying the sick on mats to wherever they heard He was. And wherever
He went—villages and towns and countrysides—they laid the sick in
the marketplaces and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of
His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed. </font>
