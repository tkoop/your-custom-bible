<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw
that her son was dead, she proceeded to annihilate all the royal
heirs. But Jehosheba daughter of King Joram, the sister of Ahaziah,
took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the sons of
the king who were being murdered. She put him and his nurse in a
bedroom to hide him from Athaliah, and he was not killed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Joash remained hidden with his nurse
in the house of the LORD for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada sent
for the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, and the guards, and had
them brought into the house of the LORD. There he made a covenant
with them and put them under oath. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He showed them the king’s son and
commanded them, “This is what you are to do: A third of you who
come on duty on the Sabbath shall guard the royal palace, a third
shall be at the gate of Sur, and a third at the gate behind the
guards. You are to take turns guarding the temple— the two
divisions that would go off duty on the Sabbath are to guard the
house of the LORD for the king. You must surround the king with
weapons in hand, and anyone who approaches the ranks must be put to
death. You must stay close to the king wherever he goes.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the commanders of hundreds did
everything that Jehoiada the priest had ordered. Each of them took
his men—those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off
duty—and came to Jehoiada the priest. Then the priest gave to the
commanders of hundreds the spears and shields of King David from the
house of the LORD. And the guards stood with weapons in hand
surrounding the king by the altar and the temple, from the south side
to the north side of the temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jehoiada brought out the king’s
son, put the crown on him, presented him with the Testimony, and
proclaimed him king. They anointed him, and the people clapped their
hands and declared, “Long live the king!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Athaliah heard the noise from the
guards and the people, she went out to the people in the house of the
LORD. And she looked out and saw the king standing by the pillar,
according to the custom. The officers and trumpeters were beside the
king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing
trumpets. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Athaliah tore her clothes and
screamed, “Treason! Treason!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Jehoiada the priest ordered the
commanders of hundreds in charge of the army, “Bring her out
between the ranks, and put to the sword anyone who follows her.”
For the priest had said, “She must not be put to death in the house
of the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they seized Athaliah as she reached the
horses’ entrance to the palace grounds, and there she was put to
death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the
LORD and the king and the people that they would be the LORD’s
people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So all the people of the land went to the
temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols to
pieces, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the
altars. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Jehoiada the priest posted guards for
the house of the LORD. He took with him the commanders of hundreds,
the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land, and they
brought the king down from the house of the LORD and entered the
royal palace by way of the Gate of the Guards. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Joash took his seat on the royal
throne, and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was
quiet, because Athaliah had been put to the sword at the royal
palace. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
