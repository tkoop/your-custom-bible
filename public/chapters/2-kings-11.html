<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a><span class="reftext">10</span>Then the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the spears and shields of King David from the house of the LORD.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a><span class="reftext">11</span>And the guards stood with weapons in hand surrounding the king by the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.
