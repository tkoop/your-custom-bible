<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Selfishness of the Unfriendly</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>He who isolates himself pursues selfish desires; </p><p class="indent"> he rebels against all sound judgment.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>A fool does not delight in understanding, </p><p class="indent"> but only in airing his opinions.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>With a wicked man comes contempt as well, </p><p class="indent"> and shame is accompanied by disgrace.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters; </p><p class="indent"> the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Showing partiality<span class="fn">a</span>  to the wicked is not good, </p><p class="indent"> nor is depriving the innocent of justice.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>A fool’s lips bring him strife, </p><p class="indent"> and his mouth invites a beating.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>A fool’s mouth is his ruin, </p><p class="indent"> and his lips are a snare to his soul.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>The words of a gossip are like choice morsels </p><p class="indent"> that go down into the inmost being.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Whoever is slothful in his work </p><p class="indent"> is brother to him who destroys.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>The name of the LORD is a strong tower; </p><p class="indent"> the righteous run to it<span class="fn">b</span>  and are safe.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>A rich man’s wealth is his fortified city; </p><p class="indent"> it is like a high wall in his imagination.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>Before his downfall a man’s heart is proud, </p><p class="indent"> but humility comes before honor.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>He who answers a matter before he hears it—</p><p class="indent"> this is folly and disgrace to him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>The spirit of a man can endure his sickness, </p><p class="indent"> but who can survive a broken spirit?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, </p><p class="indent"> and the ear of the wise seeks it out.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>A man’s gift opens doors for him, </p><p class="indent"> and brings him before great men.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>The first to state his case seems right </p><p class="indent"> until another comes and cross-examines him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>Casting the lot ends quarrels </p><p class="indent"> and separates strong opponents.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>An offended brother is harder to win than a fortified city, </p><p class="indent"> and disputes are like the bars of a castle.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>From the fruit of his mouth a man’s belly is filled; </p><p class="indent"> with the harvest from his lips he is satisfied.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>Life and death are in the power of the tongue, </p><p class="indent"> and those who love it will eat its fruit.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>He who finds a wife finds a good thing </p><p class="indent"> and obtains favor from the LORD.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>The poor man pleads for mercy, </p><p class="indent"> but the rich man answers harshly.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>A man of many companions may come to ruin, </p><p class="indent"> but there is a friend who stays closer than a brother.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Lifting the face</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">to Him</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
