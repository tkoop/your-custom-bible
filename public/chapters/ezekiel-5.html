<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Razor of Judgment</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>“As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword, use it as a barber’s razor, and shave your head and beard. Then take a set of scales and divide the hair.
<span class="reftext">2</span>When the days of the siege have ended, you are to burn up a third of the hair inside the city; you are also to take a third and slash it with the sword all around the city; and you are to scatter a third to the wind. For I will unleash a sword behind them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But you are to take a few strands of hair and secure them in the folds of your garment.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Again, take a few of these, throw them into the fire, and burn them. From there a fire will spread to the whole house of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘This is Jerusalem, which I have set in the <span class='spell ca'>centre</span><span class='spell gb'>centre</span><span class='spell us'>center</span> of the nations, with countries all around her.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But she has rebelled against <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances more wickedly than the nations, and against <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes worse than the countries around her. For her people have rejected <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances and have not walked in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘You have been more insubordinate than the nations around <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>; <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have not walked in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes or kept <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances, nor have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> even conformed<span class="fn">a</span>  to the ordinances of the nations around <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span> am against you, Jerusalem, and I will execute <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span> among you in the sight of the nations.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Because of all your abominations, I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again.
<span class="reftext">10</span>As a result, fathers among you will eat their sons, and sons will eat their fathers. I will execute <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span> against you and scatter all your remnant to every wind.’
</p><p class="hdg">Famine, Sword, and Dispersion</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, because you have defiled <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sanctuary with all your detestable idols and abominations, I <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span> will withdraw <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span>; I will not look upon you with pity, nor will I spare you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>A third of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> people will die by plague or be consumed by famine within you, a third will fall by the sword outside your walls, and a third I will scatter to every wind and unleash a sword behind them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And when <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> anger is spent and I have vented <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> wrath against them, I will be appeased. And when I have spent <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> wrath on them, they will know that I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> zeal have spoken.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I will make you a ruin and a disgrace among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by.
<span class="reftext">15</span>So you will be<span class="fn">b</span>  a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror to the nations around you, when I execute <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span> against you in anger, wrath, and raging fury. I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have spoken.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When I shower <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span><span class="fn">c</span>  with the deadly arrows of famine and destruction that I will send to destroy <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, I will intensify the famine against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and cut off <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> supply<span class="fn">d</span>  of food.
<span class="reftext">17</span>I will send famine and wild beasts against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and they will leave you childless. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have spoken.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Some Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac <i class="calibre6">My ordinances; you have even conformed</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> DSS, LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate; MT <i class="calibre6">So it will be</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">them</i> <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">staff</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
