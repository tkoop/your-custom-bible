“<font face="Tahoma, serif">As for you, son of man, take a sharp
sword, use it as a barber’s razor, and shave your head and beard.
Then take a set of scales and divide the hair. When the days of the
siege have ended, you are to burn up a third of the hair inside the
city; you are also to take a third and slash it with the sword all
around the city; and you are to scatter a third to the wind. For I
will unleash a sword behind them. </font>

and secure them in the folds of your garment. Again, take a few of
these, throw them into the fire, and burn them. From there a fire
will spread to the whole house of Israel. </font>

Jerusalem, which I have set in the center of the nations, with

and have not walked in My statutes.’ </font>
