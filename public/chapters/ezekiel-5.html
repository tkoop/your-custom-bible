<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Razor of Judgment</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>“As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword, use it as a barber’s razor, and shave your head and beard. Then take a set of scales and divide the hair.
<span class="reftext">2</span>When the days of the siege have ended, you are to burn up a third of the hair inside the city; you are also to take a third and slash it with the sword all around the city; and you are to scatter a third to the wind. For I will unleash a sword behind them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But you are to take a few strands of hair and secure them in the folds of your garment.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Again, take a few of these, throw them into the fire, and burn them. From there a fire will spread to the whole house of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘This is Jerusalem, which I have set in the <span class='spell ca'>centre</span><span class='spell gb'>centre</span><span class='spell us'>center</span> of the nations, with countries all around her.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But she has rebelled against My ordinances more wickedly than the nations, and against My statutes worse than the countries around her. For her people have rejected My ordinances and have not walked in My statutes.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘You have been more insubordinate than the nations around you; you have not walked in My statutes or kept My ordinances, nor have you even conformed<span class="fn">a</span>  to the ordinances of the nations around you.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I Myself am against you, Jerusalem, and I will execute <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span> among you in the sight of the nations.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Because of all your abominations, I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again.
<span class="reftext">10</span>As a result, fathers among you will eat their sons, and sons will eat their fathers. I will execute <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span> against you and scatter all your remnant to every wind.’
</p><p class="hdg">Famine, Sword, and Dispersion</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and abominations, I Myself will withdraw My <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span>; I will not look upon you with pity, nor will I spare you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>A third of your people will die by plague or be consumed by famine within you, a third will fall by the sword outside your walls, and a third I will scatter to every wind and unleash a sword behind them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And when My anger is spent and I have vented My wrath against them, I will be appeased. And when I have spent My wrath on them, they will know that I, the LORD, in My zeal have spoken.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I will make you a ruin and a disgrace among the nations around you, in the sight of all who pass by.
<span class="reftext">15</span>So you will be<span class="fn">b</span>  a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror to the nations around you, when I execute <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span> against you in anger, wrath, and raging fury. I, the LORD, have spoken.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When I shower you<span class="fn">c</span>  with the deadly arrows of famine and destruction that I will send to destroy you, I will intensify the famine against you and cut off your supply<span class="fn">d</span>  of food.
<span class="reftext">17</span>I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will leave you childless. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, the LORD, have spoken.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Some Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac <i class="calibre6">My ordinances; you have even conformed</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> DSS, LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate; MT <i class="calibre6">So it will be</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">them</i> <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">staff</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
