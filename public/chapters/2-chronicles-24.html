<font ><b>The Works and Wickedness of Joash</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Joash was seven years old when he became
king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother’s name
was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba. And Joash did what was right in
the eyes of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest. Jehoiada
took for himself two wives, and he had sons and daughters. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Some time later, Joash set his heart on
repairing the house of the LORD. So he gathered the priests and
Levites and said, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect the
money due annually from all Israel, to repair the house of your God.
Do it quickly.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The Levites, however, did not make haste.
So the king called Jehoiada the high priest and said, “Why have you
not required the Levites to bring from Judah and Jerusalem the tax
imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of
Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >For the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah
had broken into the house of God and had even used the sacred objects
of the house of the LORD for the Baals. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >At the king’s command a chest was made
and placed outside, at the gate of the house of the LORD. And a
proclamation was issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they were to
bring to the LORD the tax imposed by Moses the servant of God on
Israel in the wilderness. All the officers and all the people
rejoiced and brought their contributions, and they dropped them in
the chest until it was full. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Whenever the chest was brought by the
Levites to the king’s overseers and they saw that there was a large
amount of money, the royal scribe and the officer of the high priest
would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They
did this daily and gathered the money in abundance. Then the king and
Jehoiada would give the money to those who supervised the labor on
the house of the LORD to hire stonecutters and carpenters to restore
the house of the LORD, as well as workers in iron and bronze to
repair the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So the workmen labored, and in their hands
the repair work progressed. They restored the house of God according
to its specifications, and they reinforced it. When they were
finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada
to make with it the articles for the house of the LORD—utensils for
the service and for the burnt offerings, dishes, and other objects of
gold and silver. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Throughout the days of Jehoiada, burnt
offerings were presented regularly in the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Jehoiada was old and full of years,
he died at the age of 130. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And Jehoiada was buried with the kings in
the City of David, because he had done what was good in Israel for
God and His temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >After the death of Jehoiada, however, the
officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened
to them. They abandoned the house of the LORD, the God of their
fathers, and served the Asherah poles and idols. So wrath came upon
Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs. Nevertheless, the LORD
sent prophets to bring the people back to Him and to testify against
them; but they would not listen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah
son of Jehoiada the priest, who stood up before the people and said
to them, “This is what God says: ‘Why do you transgress the
commandments of the LORD so that you cannot prosper? Because you have
forsaken the LORD, He has forsaken you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But they conspired against Zechariah, and
by order of the king, they stoned him in the courtyard of the house
of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Thus King Joash failed to remember the
kindness that Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had extended to him.
Instead, Joash killed Jehoiada’s son. As he lay dying, Zechariah
said, “May the LORD see this and call you to account.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >In the spring, the army of Aram went to
war against Joash. They entered Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all
the leaders of the people, and they sent all the plunder to their
king in Damascus. Although the Aramean army had come with only a few
men, the LORD delivered into their hand a very great army. Because
Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, judgment was
executed on Joash. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And when the Arameans had withdrawn, they
left Joash severely wounded. His own servants conspired against him
for shedding the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they
killed him on his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of
David, but not in the tombs of the kings. Those who conspired against
Joash were Zabad son of Shimeath the Ammonitess and Jehozabad son of
Shimrith the Moabitess. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The accounts of the sons of Joash, as well
as the many pronouncements about him and about the restoration of the
house of God, are indeed written in the Treatise of the Book of the
Kings. And his son Amaziah reigned in his place. </font>
