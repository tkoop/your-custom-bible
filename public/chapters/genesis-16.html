<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Hagar and Ishmael</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So Sarai said to Abram, “Look now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go to my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family by her.” </p><p class="reg1"> And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So after he had lived in Canaan for ten years, his wife Sarai took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to Abram to be his wife.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And he slept with Hagar, and she conceived. But when Hagar <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be upon you! I delivered my servant into your arms, and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>“Here,” said Abram, “your servant is in your hands. Do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she fled from her.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now the angel<span class="fn">b</span>  of the LORD found Hagar by a spring of water in the desert—the spring along the road to Shur.
<span class="reftext">8</span>“Hagar, servant of Sarai,” he said, “where have you come from, and where are you going?” </p><p class="reg1">“I am running away from my mistress Sarai,” she replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So the angel of the LORD told her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her authority.”
<span class="reftext">10</span>Then the angel added, “I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The angel of the LORD proceeded: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Behold, you have conceived and will bear a son. </p><p class="indent"> And you shall name him Ishmael,<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent"> for the LORD has heard your cry of affliction.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>He will be a wild donkey of a man, </p><p class="indent"> and his hand will be against everyone, </p><p class="indent"> and everyone’s hand against him; </p><p class="indent1"> he will live in hostility </p><p class="indent"> toward all his brothers.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Hagar gave this name to the LORD who had spoken to her: “You are the God who sees me,<span class="fn">d</span>” for she said, “Here I have seen the One who sees me!”
<span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi.<span class="fn">e</span>  It is located between Kadesh and Bered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">her mistress became despised in her sight</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i>; also in verses 9, 10, and 11; corresponding pronouns may also be capitalized.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Ishmael</i> means <i class="calibre6">God hears</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">El-Roi</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Beer-lahai-roi</i> means <i class="calibre6">well of the Living One who sees me</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
