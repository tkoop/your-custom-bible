<font ><b>Hagar and Ishmael</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no
children, but she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar. So Sarai
said to Abram, “Look now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing
children. Please go to my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family
by her.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
So after he had lived in Canaan for ten years, his wife Sarai took
her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to Abram to be his wife.
And he slept with Hagar, and she conceived. But when Hagar realized
that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong
done to me be upon you! I delivered my servant into your arms, and
ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with
contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Here,” said Abram, “your servant is
in your hands. Do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai treated
Hagar so harshly that she fled from her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the angel of the LORD found Hagar by a
spring of water in the desert—the spring along the road to Shur.
“Hagar, servant of Sarai,” he said, “where have you come from,
and where are you going?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I am running away from my mistress
Sarai,” she replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the angel of the LORD told her, “Return
to your mistress and submit to her authority.” Then the angel
added, “I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be
too numerous to count.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The angel of the LORD proceeded: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Behold, you have conceived and will
bear a son. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >And you shall name him Ishmael, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >for the LORD has heard your cry of
affliction. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He will be a wild donkey of a man, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and his hand will be against everyone, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and everyone’s hand against him; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >he will live in hostility </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >toward all his brothers.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Hagar gave this name to the LORD who
had spoken to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said,
“Here I have seen the One who sees me!” Therefore the well was
called Beer-lahai-roi. It is located between Kadesh and Bered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave
the name Ishmael to the son she had borne. Abram was eighty-six years
old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him. </font>
