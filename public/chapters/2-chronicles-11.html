<span class="reftext">2</span>But the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Shemaiah the man of God:
<span class="reftext">3</span>“Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin
<span class="reftext">4</span>that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are not to go up and fight against <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers. Each of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must return home, for this word is from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1"> So they listened to the words of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and turned back from going against Jeroboam.
</p><p class="hdg">Rehoboam Fortifies Judah</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Rehoboam continued to live in Jerusalem, and he built up cities for <span class='spell ca'>defence</span><span class='spell gb'>defence</span><span class='spell us'>defense</span> in Judah.
<span class="reftext">6</span>He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
<span class="reftext">7</span>Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,
<span class="reftext">8</span>Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
<span class="reftext">9</span>Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
<span class="reftext">10</span>Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, the fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.
<span class="reftext">11</span>He strengthened their fortresses and put officers in them, with supplies of food, oil, and wine.
<span class="reftext">12</span>He also put shields and spears in all the cities and strengthened them greatly. So Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.
</p><p class="hdg">Jeroboam Forsakes the Priests and Levites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Moreover, the priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel stood with Rehoboam.
<span class="reftext">14</span>For the Levites left their pasturelands and their possessions and went to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat demons and calf idols he had made.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Those from every tribe of Israel who had set their hearts to seek <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> their God followed the Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of their fathers.
<span class="reftext">17</span>So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years, because they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.
</p><p class="hdg">Rehoboam’s Family</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab.
<span class="reftext">19</span>She bore sons to him: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>After her, he married Maacah daughter of Absalom, and she bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, intending to make him king.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Rehoboam also acted wisely by dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and sought many wives for them.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
