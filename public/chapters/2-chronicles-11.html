<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he
mobilized the house of Judah and Benjamin—180,000 chosen
warriors—to fight against Israel and restore the kingdom to
Rehoboam. But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God:
“Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and all the Israelites
in Judah and Benjamin that this is what the LORD says: ‘You are not
to go up and fight against your brothers. Each of you must return
home, for this word is from Me.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they listened to the words of the LORD
and turned back from going against Jeroboam. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Rehoboam continued to live in Jerusalem,
and he built up cities for defense in Judah. He built up Bethlehem,
Etam, Tekoa, Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, Adoraim,
Lachish, Azekah, Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, the fortified cities in
Judah and Benjamin. He strengthened their fortresses and put officers
in them, with supplies of food, oil, and wine. He also put shields
and spears in all the cities and strengthened them greatly. So Judah
and Benjamin belonged to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moreover, the priests and Levites from all
their districts throughout Israel stood with Rehoboam. For the
Levites left their pasturelands and their possessions and went to
Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them
as priests of the LORD. And Jeroboam appointed his own priests for
the high places and for the goat demons and calf idols he had made. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Those from every tribe of Israel who had
set their hearts to seek the LORD their God followed the Levites to
Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers. So they
strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of
Solomon for three years, because they walked for three years in the
way of David and Solomon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the
daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of
Jesse’s son Eliab. She bore sons to him: Jeush, Shemariah, and
Zaham. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After her, he married Maacah daughter of
Absalom, and she bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and
concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and
he was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as
chief prince among his brothers, intending to make him king. Rehoboam
also acted wisely by dispersing some of his sons throughout the
districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He
gave them abundant provisions and sought many wives for them. </font>
