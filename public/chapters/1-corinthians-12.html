<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do
not want you to be uninformed. You know that when you were pagans,
you were influenced and led astray to mute idols. Therefore I inform
you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus
be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the
Holy Spirit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">There are different gifts, but the same
Spirit. There are different ministries, but the same Lord. There are
different ways of working, but the same God works all things in all
people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now to each one the manifestation of the
Spirit is given for the common good. To one there is given through
the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge
by the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another
gifts of healing by that one Spirit, to another the working of
miracles, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between
spirits, to another speaking in various tongues, and to still another
the interpretation of tongues. All these are the work of one and the
same Spirit, who apportions them to each one as He determines. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The body is a unit, though it is composed
of many parts. And although its parts are many, they all form one
body. So it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized
into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free, and we were all
given one Spirit to drink. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the body does not consist of one part,
but of many. If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do
not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of
the body. And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do
not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of
the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of
hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of
smell be? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But in fact, God has arranged the members
of the body, every one of them, according to His design. If they were
all one part, where would the body be? As it is, there are many
parts, but one body. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do
not need you.” Nor can the head say to the feet, “I do not need
you.” On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker
are indispensable, and the parts we consider less honorable, we treat
with greater honor. And our unpresentable parts are treated with
special modesty, whereas our presentable parts have no such need. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But God has composed the body and has
given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, so that there should
be no division in the body, but that its members should have mutual
concern for one another. If one part suffers, every part suffers with
it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now you are the body of Christ, and each
of you is a member of it. And in the church God has appointed first
of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of
miracles, and those with gifts of healing, helping, administration,
and various tongues. Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all
teachers? Do all work miracles? Do all have gifts of healing? Do all
speak in tongues? Do all interpret? But eagerly desire the greater
gifts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And now I will show you the most excellent
way. </font>
