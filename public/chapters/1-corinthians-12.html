<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Spiritual Gifts</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed.
<span class="reftext">2</span>You know that when you were pagans, you were influenced and led astray to mute idols.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore I inform you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>There are different gifts, but the same Spirit.
<span class="reftext">5</span>There are different ministries, but the same Lord.
<span class="reftext">6</span>There are different ways of working, but the same God works all things in all people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
<span class="reftext">8</span>To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by the same Spirit,
<span class="reftext">9</span>to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,
<span class="reftext">10</span>to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in various tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.
<span class="reftext">11</span>All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, who apportions them to each one as He determines.
</p><p class="hdg">The Body of Christ</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>The body is a unit, though it is composed of many parts. And although its parts are many, they all form one body. So it is with Christ.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free, and we were all given one Spirit to drink.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>For the body does not consist of one part, but of many.
<span class="reftext">15</span>If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.
<span class="reftext">17</span>If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>But in fact, God has arranged the members of the body, every one of them, according to His design.
<span class="reftext">19</span>If they were all one part, where would the body be?
<span class="reftext">20</span>As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you.” Nor can the head say to the feet, “I do not need you.”
<span class="reftext">22</span>On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
<span class="reftext">23</span>and the parts we consider less <span class='spell ca'>honourable</span><span class='spell gb'>honourable</span><span class='spell us'>honorable</span>, we treat with greater <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span>. And our unpresentable parts are treated with special modesty,
<span class="reftext">24</span>whereas our presentable parts have no such need. </p><p class="reg1"> But God has composed the body and has given greater <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> to the parts that lacked it,
<span class="reftext">25</span>so that there should be no division in the body, but that its members should have mutual concern for one another.
<span class="reftext">26</span>If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is <span class='spell ca'>honoured</span><span class='spell gb'>honoured</span><span class='spell us'>honored</span>, every part rejoices with it.
</p><p class="hdg">The Greater Gifts</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Now you are the body of Christ, and each of you is a member of it.
<span class="reftext">28</span>And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, and those with gifts of healing, helping, administration, and various tongues.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
<span class="reftext">30</span>Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
<span class="reftext">31</span>But eagerly desire the greater gifts. </p><p class="reg1"> And now I will show you the most excellent way.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
