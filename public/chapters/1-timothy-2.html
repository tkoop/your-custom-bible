<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Call to Prayer</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be offered for everyone—
<span class="reftext">2</span>for kings and all those in authority—so that we may lead tranquil and quiet lives in all godliness and dignity.
<span class="reftext">3</span>This is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,
<span class="reftext">4</span>who wants everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
<span class="reftext">6</span>who gave Himself as a ransom for all—the testimony that was given at just the right time.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>For this reason I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a faithful and true teacher of the Gentiles. I am telling the truth; I am not lying about anything.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore I want the men everywhere<span class="fn">a</span>  to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or dissension.
</p><p class="hdg">Instructions to Women</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Likewise, I want the women to adorn themselves with respectable apparel, with modesty, and with self-control, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,
<span class="reftext">10</span>but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess to worship God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>A woman<span class="fn">b</span>  must learn in quietness and full submissiveness.
<span class="reftext">12</span>I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man;<span class="fn">c</span>  she is to remain quiet.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Women, however, will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in every place (of worship)</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">wife</i>; also in verse 12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">over her husband</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
