<font face="Tahoma, serif">First of all, then, I urge that petitions,
prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be offered for everyone—
for kings and all those in authority—so that we may lead tranquil
and quiet lives in all godliness and dignity. This is good and
pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who wants everyone to be
saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For there is one God, and there is one
mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself
as a ransom for all—the testimony that was given at just the right
time. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For this reason I was appointed as a
preacher, an apostle, and a faithful and true teacher of the
Gentiles. I am telling the truth; I am not lying about anything.
Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands,
without anger or dissension. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Likewise, I want the women to adorn
themselves with respectable apparel, with modesty, and with
self-control, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive
clothes, but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess to
worship God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">A woman must learn in quietness and full
submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise
authority over a man; she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed
first, and then Eve. And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the
woman who was deceived and fell into transgression. Women, however,
will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love,
and holiness, with self-control. </font>
