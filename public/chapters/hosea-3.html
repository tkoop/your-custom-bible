<font >Then the LORD said to me, “Go show love
to your wife again, though she is loved by another and is an
adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they
turn to other gods and offer raisin cakes to idols.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I bought her for fifteen shekels of
silver and a homer and a lethech of barley. Then I said to her, “You
must live with me for many days; you must not be promiscuous or
belong to another, and I will do the same for you.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the Israelites must live many days
without king or prince, without sacrifice or sacred pillar, and
without ephod or idol. Afterward, the people of Israel will return
and seek the LORD their God and David their king. They will come
trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days. </font>
