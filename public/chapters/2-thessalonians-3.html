<font face="Tahoma, serif">Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the
word of the Lord may spread quickly and be held in honor, just as it
was with you. And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil
men; for not everyone holds to the faith. But the Lord is faithful,
and He will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one. And we
have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to
do what we command. May the Lord direct your hearts into God’s love
and Christ’s perseverance. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now we command you, brothers, in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from any brother who leads an
undisciplined life that is not in keeping with the tradition you
received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate
us, because we were not undisciplined among you, nor did we eat
anyone’s food without paying for it. Instead, in labor and toil, we
worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you.
Not that we lack this right, but we wanted to offer ourselves as an
example for you to imitate. For even while we were with you, we gave
you this command: “If anyone is unwilling to work, he shall not
eat.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Yet we hear that some of you are leading
undisciplined lives and accomplishing nothing but being busybodies.
We command and urge such people by our Lord Jesus Christ to begin
working quietly to earn their own living. But as for you, brothers,
do not grow weary in well-doing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Take note of anyone who does not obey the
instructions we have given in this letter. Do not associate with him,
so that he may be ashamed. Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but
warn him as a brother. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now may the Lord of peace Himself give you
peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you. </font>
