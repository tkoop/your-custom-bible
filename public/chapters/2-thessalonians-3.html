<span class="reftext">2</span>And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men; for not everyone holds to the faith.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But the Lord is faithful, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> will strengthen you and guard <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from the evil one.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And we have confidence in the Lord that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are doing and will continue to do what we command.
<span class="reftext">5</span>May the Lord direct <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hearts into God’s love and Christ’s perseverance.
</p><p class="hdg">A Warning against Idleness</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Now we command <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from any brother who leads an undisciplined life that is not in keeping with the tradition <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> received<span class="fn">b</span>  from us.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not undisciplined among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>,
<span class="reftext">8</span>nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. Instead, in <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> and toil, we worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Not that we lack this right, but we wanted to offer ourselves as an example for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to imitate.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For even while we were with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, we gave <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> this command: “If anyone is unwilling to work, he shall not eat.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Yet we hear that some of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are leading undisciplined lives and accomplishing nothing but being busybodies.
<span class="reftext">12</span>We command and urge such people by our Lord Jesus Christ to begin working quietly to earn their own living.
<span class="reftext">13</span>But as for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, brothers, do not grow weary in well-doing.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Take note of anyone who does not obey the instructions we have given in this letter. Do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
