<font >Then Jesus looked up and saw the rich
putting their gifts into the treasury, and He saw a poor widow put in
two small copper coins. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Truly I tell
you,”</font> He said, <font color="#a80000">“this poor widow has
put in more than all the others. For they all contributed out of
their surplus, but she out of her poverty has put in all she had to
live on.”</font> </font>

<font >As some of the disciples were remarking
how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and consecrated
gifts, Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“As for what you see here,
the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every
one will be thrown down.”</font> </font>

these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to
take place?” </font>

<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“See
to it that you are not deceived. For many will come in My name,
claiming, ‘I am He,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow
them. When you hear of wars and rebellions, do not be alarmed. These
things must happen first, but the end is not imminent.”</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He told them, <font color="#a80000">“Nation

they will seize you and persecute you. On account of My name they
will deliver you to the synagogues and prisons, and they will bring
you before kings and governors. This will be your opportunity to
serve as witnesses. So make up your mind not to worry beforehand how
to defend yourselves. For I will give you speech and wisdom that none
of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict. </font></font>

even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and some of
you will be put to death. And you will be hated by everyone because
of My name. Yet not even a hair of your head will perish. By your
patient endurance you will gain your souls. </font></font>

Jerusalem surrounded by armies, you will know that her desolation is
near. Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let
those in the city get out, and let those in the country stay out of
the city. For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is
written. </font></font>

days will be for pregnant and nursing mothers! For there will be
great distress upon the land and wrath against this people. They will
fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive into all the

the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >There will be signs
in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth dismay among the
nations, bewildered by the roaring of the sea and the surging of the
waves. Men will faint from fear and anxiety over what is coming upon
the earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. At that time
they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great
glory. When these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your
heads, because your redemption is drawing near.” </font></font>

<font >Then Jesus told them a parable: <font color="#a80000">“Look
at the fig tree and all the trees. When they sprout leaves, you can
see for yourselves and know that summer is near. So also, when you
see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.
Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these
things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words
will never pass away.</font> </font>

yourselves, or your hearts will be weighed down by dissipation,
drunkenness, and the worries of life—and that day will spring upon
you suddenly like a snare. For it will come upon all who dwell on the
face of all the earth. So keep watch at all times, and pray that you
may have the strength to escape all that is about to happen and to
stand before the Son of Man.” </font></font>

<font >Every day Jesus taught at the temple, but
every evening He went out to spend the night on the Mount of Olives.
And early in the morning all the people would come to hear Him at the
temple. </font>
