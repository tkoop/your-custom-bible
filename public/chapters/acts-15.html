<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then some men came down from Judea and
were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according
to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.” And after engaging
these men in sharp debate, Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along
with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles
and elders about this question. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Sent on their way by the church, they
passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, recounting the conversion of
the Gentiles and bringing great joy to all the brothers. On their
arrival in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and apostles
and elders, to whom they reported all that God had done through them.

<font face="Tahoma, serif">But some believers from the party of the
Pharisees stood up and declared, “The Gentiles must be circumcised
and required to obey the law of Moses.” So the apostles and elders
met to look into this matter. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">After much discussion, Peter got up and
said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a
choice among you that the Gentiles would hear from my lips the
message of the gospel and believe. And God, who knows the heart,
showed His approval by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as He did
to us. He made no distinction between us and them, for He cleansed
their hearts by faith. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now then, why do you test God by placing
on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers
have been able to bear? On the contrary, we believe it is through the
grace of the Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The whole assembly fell silent as they
listened to Barnabas and Paul describing the signs and wonders God
had done among the Gentiles through them. When they had finished
speaking, James declared, “Brothers, listen to me! Simon has told
us how God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people to
be His own. The words of the prophets agree with this, as it is
written: </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">It is my judgment, therefore, that we
should not cause trouble for the Gentiles who are turning to God.
Instead, we should write and tell them to abstain from food polluted

ancient times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the apostles and elders, with the

<font face="Tahoma, serif">It has come to our attention that some
went out from us without our authorization and unsettled you,
troubling your minds by what they said. So we all agreed to choose
men to send to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who
have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to tell you in person the
same things we are writing. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to
us not to burden you with anything beyond these essential
requirements: You must abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from
blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual
immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Judas and Silas, who themselves were
prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers. After
spending some time there, they were sent off by the brothers in peace

at Antioch, along with many others, teaching and preaching the word
of the Lord. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Some time later Paul said to Barnabas,
“Let us go back and visit the brothers in every town where we
proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.”
Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark. But Paul thought it
best not to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and
had not accompanied them in the work. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Their disagreement was so sharp that they
parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, but Paul
chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the
Lord. And he traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the
churches. </font>
