<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Dispute over Circumcision</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, “Unless <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> cannot be saved.”
<span class="reftext">2</span>And after engaging these men in sharp debate, Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, recounting the conversion of the Gentiles and bringing great joy to all the brothers.
<span class="reftext">4</span>On their arrival in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and apostles and elders, to whom they reported all that God had done through them.
</p><p class="hdg">The Council at Jerusalem<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Amos 9:11–15; Galatians 2:1–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But some believers from the party of the Pharisees stood up and declared, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses.”
<span class="reftext">6</span>So the apostles and elders met to look into this matter.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>After much discussion, Peter got up and said to them, “Brothers, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> know that in the early days God made a choice among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> that the Gentiles would hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And God, who knows the heart, showed <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> approval by giving the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> to them, just as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> did to us.
<span class="reftext">9</span>He made no distinction between us and them, for <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> cleansed their hearts by faith.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now then, why do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> test God by placing on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear?
<span class="reftext">11</span>On the contrary, we believe it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>The whole assembly fell silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul describing the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.
<span class="reftext">13</span>When they had finished speaking, James declared, “Brothers, listen to me!
<span class="reftext">14</span>Simon<span class="fn">a</span>  has told us how God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people to be <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own.
<span class="reftext">15</span>The words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>‘After this I will return and rebuild </p><p class="indent"> the fallen tent of David. </p><p class="indent1"> Its ruins I will rebuild, </p><p class="indent"> and I will restore it,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>so that the remnant of men may seek the Lord, </p><p class="indent"> and all the Gentiles who are called by <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name, </p><p class="indent1"> says the Lord who does these things
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">18</span>that have been known for ages.’<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>It is my <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span>, therefore, that we should not cause trouble for the Gentiles who are turning to God.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Instead, we should write and tell them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.
<span class="reftext">21</span>For Moses has been proclaimed in every city from ancient times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Letter to the Gentile Believers</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to select men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas called Barsabbas and Silas, two leaders among the brothers,
<span class="reftext">23</span>and sent them with this letter: </p><p class="tab1stline"> The apostles and the elders, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers, </p><p class="tab1stline"> To the brothers among the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: </p><p class="tab1stline"> Greetings.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>It has come to our attention that some went out from us without our authorization and unsettled <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, troubling <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> minds by what they said.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">25</span>So we all agreed to choose men to send to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
<span class="reftext">26</span>men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in person the same things we are writing.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">28</span>It seemed good to the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> and to us not to burden <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> with anything beyond these essential requirements:
<span class="reftext">29</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> must abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality. <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> will do well to avoid these things. </p><p class="tab1stline"> Farewell.
</p><p class="hdg">The Believers at Antioch Rejoice</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>So the men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they assembled the congregation and delivered the letter.
<span class="reftext">31</span>When the people read it, they rejoiced at its encouraging message.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers.
<span class="reftext">33</span>After spending some time there, they were sent off by the brothers in peace to return to those who had sent them.<span class="fn">d</span> 

<span class="reftext">35</span>But Paul and Barnabas remained at Antioch, along with many others, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord.

<span class="reftext">37</span>Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark.
<span class="reftext">38</span>But Paul thought it best not to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Their disagreement was so sharp that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,
<span class="reftext">40</span>but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.
