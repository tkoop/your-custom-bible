<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">God’s Promise to Isaac<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Genesis 12:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now there was another famine in the land, subsequent to the one that had occurred in Abraham’s time. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines at Gerar.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt. Settle in the land where I tell you.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Stay in this land as a foreigner, and I will be with you and bless you. For I will give all these lands to you and your offspring, and I will confirm the oath that I swore to your father Abraham.
<span class="reftext">4</span>I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and I will give them all these lands, and through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed,
<span class="reftext">5</span>because Abraham listened to <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> voice and kept <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> charge, <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> commandments, <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes, and <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> laws.”
</p><p class="hdg">Isaac Deceives Abimelech</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So Isaac settled in Gerar.
<span class="reftext">7</span>But when the men of that place asked about his wife, he said, “She is my sister.” For he was afraid to say, “She is my wife,” since he thought to himself, “The men of this place will kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is so beautiful.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from the window and was surprised to see Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Abimelech sent for Isaac and said, “So she is really your wife! How could you say, ‘She is my sister’?” </p><p class="reg1"> Isaac replied, “Because I thought I might die on account of her.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>“What is this you have done to us?” asked Abimelech. “One of the people could easily have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”
<span class="reftext">11</span>So Abimelech warned all the people, saying, “Whoever harms this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”
</p><p class="hdg">Isaac’s Prosperity</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Now Isaac sowed seed in the land, and that very year he reaped a hundredfold. And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> blessed him,
<span class="reftext">13</span>and he became richer and richer, until he was exceedingly wealthy.
<span class="reftext">14</span>He owned so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him.
<span class="reftext">15</span>So the Philistines took dirt and stopped up all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Depart from us, for you are much too powerful for us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So Isaac left that place and encamped in the <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span> of Gerar and settled there.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died. And he gave these wells the same names his father had given them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found a well of fresh water<span class="fn">a</span>  there.
<span class="reftext">20</span>But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek,<span class="fn">b</span>  because they contended with him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then they dug another well and quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>He moved on from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. He named it Rehoboth<span class="fn">d</span>  and said, “At last <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>From there Isaac went up to Beersheba,
<span class="reftext">24</span>and that night <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> servant Abraham.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>So Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and he pitched his tent there. His servants also dug a well there.
</p><p class="hdg">Isaac’s Covenant with Abimelech</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Later, Abimelech came to Isaac from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>“Why have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> come to me?” Isaac asked them. “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> hated me and sent me away.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>“We can plainly see that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has been with you,” they replied. “We recommend that there should now be an oath between us and you. Let us make a covenant with you
<span class="reftext">29</span>that you will not harm us, just as we have not harmed you but have done only good to you, sending you on your way in peace. And now you are blessed by <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>So Isaac prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
<span class="reftext">31</span>And they got up early the next morning and swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>On that same day, Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. “We have found water!” they told him.
<span class="reftext">33</span>So he called it Shibah,<span class="fn">e</span>  and to this day the name of the city is Beersheba.<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Esau’s Wives</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>When Esau was forty years old, he took as his wives Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.
<span class="reftext">35</span>And they brought grief to Isaac and Rebekah.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">flowing water</i> or <i class="calibre6">living water</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Esek</i> means <i class="calibre6">contention</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Sitnah</i> means <i class="calibre6">enmity</i> or <i class="calibre6">hostility</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Rehoboth</i> means <i class="calibre6">broad places</i> or <i class="calibre6">open spaces</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Shibah</i> can mean <i class="calibre6">oath</i> or <i class="calibre6">seven</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">Beersheba</i> means <i class="calibre6">well of seven</i> or <i class="calibre6">well of the oath</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
