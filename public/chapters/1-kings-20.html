<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Ben-hadad king of Aram assembled his
entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and
chariots, he marched up, besieged Samaria, and waged war against it.
Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, saying,
“This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘Your silver and gold are mine, and
your best wives and children are mine!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the king of Israel replied, “Just as
you say, my lord the king: I am yours, along with all that I have.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The messengers came back and said, “This
is what Ben-hadad says: ‘I have sent to you to demand your silver,
your gold, your wives, and your children. But about this time
tomorrow I will send my servants to search your palace and the houses
of your servants. They will seize and carry away all that is precious
to you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king of Israel summoned all the
elders of the land and said, “Please take note and see that this
man is looking for trouble, for when he demanded my wives, my
children, my silver, and my gold, I did not deny him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the elders and the people all said,
“Do not listen to him or consent to his terms.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Ahab answered the messengers of
Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you demanded of your
servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the messengers departed and relayed the
message to Ben-hadad. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Ben-hadad sent another message to
Ahab: “May the gods deal with me, and ever so severely, if enough
dust remains of Samaria for each of my men to have a handful.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the king of Israel replied, “Tell
him: ‘The one putting on his armor should not boast like one taking
it off.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ben-hadad received this message while he
and the kings were drinking in their tents, and he said to his
servants, “Take your positions.” So they stationed themselves
against the city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile a prophet approached Ahab king
of Israel and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Do you see
this entire great army? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand this
very day, and you will know that I am the LORD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >By whom?” Ahab asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the prophet replied, “This is what
the LORD says: ‘By the young officers of the district governors.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Who will start the battle?” asked
Ahab. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >You will,” answered the prophet. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Ahab assembled the young officers of
the district governors, and there were 232 men. And after them, he
assembled the rest of the Israelite troops, 7,000 in all. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They marched out at noon while Ben-hadad
and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk.
And the young officers of the district governors marched out first. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Ben-hadad had sent out scouts, who
reported to him, “Men are marching out of Samaria.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >If they have marched out in peace,”
he said, “take them alive. Even if they have marched out for war,
take them alive.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, these young officers of the
district governors marched out of the city, with the army behind
them, and each one struck down his opponent. So the Arameans fled,
with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on
horseback with the cavalry. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king of Israel marched out and
attacked the horses and chariots, inflicting a great slaughter on the
Arameans. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Afterward, the prophet approached the king
of Israel and said, “Go and strengthen your position, and take note
what you must do, for in the spring the king of Aram will come up
against you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, the servants of the king of
Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why
they prevailed over us. Instead, we should fight them on the plains;
surely then we will prevail. So do this: Dismiss all the kings from
their positions and replace them with other officers. And you must
raise an army like the one you have lost—horse for horse and
chariot for chariot—so we can fight the Israelites on the plain,
where we will surely prevail.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the king approved their plan and acted
accordingly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the spring, Ben-hadad mobilized the
Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. The Israelites
also mobilized, gathered supplies, and marched out to meet them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Israelites camped before them like two
small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the man of God approached the king of
Israel and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because the
Arameans think the LORD is a god of the hills and not of the valleys,
I will deliver all this great army into your hand. Then you will know
that I am the LORD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For seven days the armies camped opposite
each other, and on the seventh day the battle ensued, and the
Israelites struck down the Arameans—a hundred thousand foot
soldiers in one day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The rest of them fled into the city of
Aphek, where the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the remaining
men. Ben-hadad also fled to the city and hid in an inner room. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the servants of Ben-hadad said to
him, “Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel
are merciful. Let us go out to the king of Israel with sackcloth
around our waists and ropes around our heads. Perhaps he will spare
your life.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So with sackcloth around their waists and
ropes around their heads, they went to the king of Israel and said,
“Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please spare my life.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the king answered, “Is he still
alive? He is my brother.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the men were looking for a sign of
hope, and they quickly grasped at this word and replied, “Yes, your
brother Ben-hadad.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Go and get him!” said the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Ben-hadad came out, and Ahab had him
come up into his chariot. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ben-hadad said to him, “I will restore
the cities my father took from your father; you may set up your own
marketplaces in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >By this treaty I release you,” Ahab
replied. So he made a treaty with him and sent him away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, by the word of the LORD, one of
the sons of the prophets said to his companion, “Strike me,
please!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the man refused to strike him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the prophet said to him, “Because
you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, as soon as you depart from
me a lion will kill you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when he left, a lion found him and
killed him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the prophet found another man and
said, “Strike me, please!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the man struck him and wounded him, and
the prophet went and waited on the road for the king, disguising
himself with a bandage over his eyes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the king passed by, he cried out to the
king: “Your servant had marched out into the middle of the battle,
when suddenly a man came over with a captive and told me, ‘Guard
this man! If he goes missing for any reason, your life will be
exchanged for his life, or you will weigh out a talent of silver.’
But while your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the king of Israel said to him, “So
shall your judgment be; you have pronounced it on yourself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the prophet quickly removed the
bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one
of the prophets. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the prophet said to the king, “This
is what the LORD says: ‘Because you have let slip from your hand
the man I had devoted to destruction, your life will be exchanged for
his life, and your people for his people.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went
home to Samaria. </font>
