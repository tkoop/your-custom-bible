<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Ben-hadad king of Aram assembled his
entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and
chariots, he marched up, besieged Samaria, and waged war against it.
Then he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, saying,
“This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘Your silver and gold are mine, and
your best wives and children are mine!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the king of Israel replied, “Just as
you say, my lord the king: I am yours, along with all that I have.”

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The messengers came back and said, “This
is what Ben-hadad says: ‘I have sent to you to demand your silver,
your gold, your wives, and your children. But about this time
tomorrow I will send my servants to search your palace and the houses
of your servants. They will seize and carry away all that is precious
to you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king of Israel summoned all the
elders of the land and said, “Please take note and see that this
man is looking for trouble, for when he demanded my wives, my
children, my silver, and my gold, I did not deny him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the elders and the people all said,
“Do not listen to him or consent to his terms.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Ahab answered the messengers of
Ben-hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you demanded of your
servant the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the messengers departed and relayed the

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Ben-hadad sent another message to
Ahab: “May the gods deal with me, and ever so severely, if enough
dust remains of Samaria for each of my men to have a handful.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the king of Israel replied, “Tell

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ben-hadad received this message while he
and the kings were drinking in their tents, and he said to his
servants, “Take your positions.” So they stationed themselves
against the city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile a prophet approached Ahab king
of Israel and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Do you see
this entire great army? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand this
very day, and you will know that I am the LORD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the prophet replied, “This is what

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Who will start the battle?” asked

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Ahab assembled the young officers of
the district governors, and there were 232 men. And after them, he
assembled the rest of the Israelite troops, 7,000 in all. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They marched out at noon while Ben-hadad
and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk.
And the young officers of the district governors marched out first. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Ben-hadad had sent out scouts, who

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">If they have marched out in peace,”

take them alive.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile, these young officers of the
district governors marched out of the city, with the army behind
them, and each one struck down his opponent. So the Arameans fled,
with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on
horseback with the cavalry. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king of Israel marched out and
attacked the horses and chariots, inflicting a great slaughter on the
Arameans. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Afterward, the prophet approached the king
of Israel and said, “Go and strengthen your position, and take note
what you must do, for in the spring the king of Aram will come up
against you.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile, the servants of the king of
Aram said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why
they prevailed over us. Instead, we should fight them on the plains;
surely then we will prevail. So do this: Dismiss all the kings from
their positions and replace them with other officers. And you must
raise an army like the one you have lost—horse for horse and
chariot for chariot—so we can fight the Israelites on the plain,
where we will surely prevail.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the spring, Ben-hadad mobilized the
Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. The Israelites
also mobilized, gathered supplies, and marched out to meet them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Israelites camped before them like two

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the man of God approached the king of
Israel and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Because the

I will deliver all this great army into your hand. Then you will know
that I am the LORD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

<font face="Tahoma, serif">For seven days the armies camped opposite

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The rest of them fled into the city of
Aphek, where the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the remaining

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the servants of Ben-hadad said to
him, “Look now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">By this treaty I release you,” Ahab
