<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Cain and Abel<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Hebrews 11:4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>And Adam had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain.<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="reg1">“With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man,” she said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Later she gave birth to Cain’s brother Abel. </p><p class="reg1"> Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, while Cain was a tiller of the soil.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So in the course of time, Cain brought some of the fruit of the soil as an offering to the LORD,
<span class="reftext">4</span>while Abel brought the best portions of the firstborn of his flock. </p><p class="reg1"> And the LORD looked with <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> on Abel and his offering,
<span class="reftext">5</span>but He had no regard for Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>“Why are you angry,” said the LORD to Cain, “and why has your countenance fallen?
<span class="reftext">7</span>If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you refuse to do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires you,<span class="fn">b</span>  but you must master it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out to the field.”<span class="fn">c</span>  And while they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And the LORD said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” </p><p class="reg1">“I do not know!” he answered. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>“What have you done?” replied the LORD. “The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Now you are cursed and banished from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
<span class="reftext">12</span>When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its produce to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment<span class="fn">d</span>  is greater than I can bear.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Behold, this day You have driven me from the face of the earth, and from Your face I will be hidden; I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>“Not so!”<span class="fn">e</span>  replied the LORD. “If anyone slays Cain, then Cain will be avenged sevenfold.” And the LORD placed a mark on Cain, so that no one who found him would kill him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod,<span class="fn">f</span>  east of Eden.
</p><p class="hdg">The Descendants of Cain</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>And Cain had relations with his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Then Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methusael, and Methusael was the father of Lamech.
<span class="reftext">19</span>And Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and raise livestock.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And Zillah gave birth to Tubal-cain, a forger of every implement of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then Lamech said to his wives: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; </p><p class="indent"> wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. </p><p class="indent1"> For I have slain a man for wounding me, </p><p class="indent"> a young man for striking me.
