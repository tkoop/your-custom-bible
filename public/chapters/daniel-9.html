<span class="reftext">3</span>So I turned my attention to the Lord God to seek <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> by prayer and petition, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.

<span class="reftext">21</span>while I was still praying, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice.
