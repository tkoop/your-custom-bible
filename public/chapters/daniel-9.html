<font ><b>Gabriel’s Prophecy of the Seventy
Weeks</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes,
a Mede by descent, who was made ruler over the kingdom of the
Chaldeans — in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood
from the sacred books, according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah
the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy
years. So I turned my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer
and petition, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And I prayed to the LORD my God and
confessed, “O, Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His
covenant of loving devotion to those who love Him and keep His
commandments, we have sinned and done wrong. We have acted wickedly
and rebelled. We have turned away from Your commandments and
ordinances. We have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who
spoke in Your name to our kings, leaders, and fathers, and to all the
people of the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >To You, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but
this day we are covered with shame—the men of Judah, the people of
Jerusalem, and all Israel near and far, in all the countries to which
You have driven us because of our unfaithfulness to You. O LORD, we
are covered with shame—our kings, our leaders, and our
fathers—because we have sinned against You. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >To the Lord our God belong compassion and
forgiveness, even though we have rebelled against Him and have not
obeyed the voice of the LORD our God to walk in His laws, which He
set before us through His servants the prophets. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All Israel has transgressed Your law and
turned away, refusing to obey Your voice; so the oath and the curse
written in the Law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on
us, because we have sinned against You. You have carried out the
words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing upon us a
great disaster. For under all of heaven, nothing has ever been done
like what has been done to Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Just as it is written in the Law of Moses,
all this disaster has come upon us, yet we have not sought the favor
of the LORD our God by turning from our iniquities and giving
attention to Your truth. Therefore the LORD has kept the calamity in
store and brought it upon us. For the LORD our God is righteous in
all He does; yet we have not obeyed His voice. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now, O Lord our God, who brought Your
people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and who made for
Yourself a name renowned to this day, we have sinned; we have acted
wickedly. O Lord, in keeping with all Your righteous acts, I pray
that Your anger and wrath may turn away from Your city Jerusalem,
Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our
fathers, Jerusalem and Your people are a reproach to all around us. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So now, our God, hear the prayers and
petitions of Your servant. For Your sake, O Lord, cause Your face to
shine upon Your desolate sanctuary. Incline Your ear, O my God, and
hear; open Your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears
Your name. For we are not presenting our petitions before You because
of our righteous acts, but because of Your great compassion. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >O Lord, listen! O Lord, forgive! O Lord,
hear and act! For Your sake, O my God, do not delay, because Your
city and Your people bear Your name.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While I was speaking, praying, confessing
my sin and that of my people Israel, and presenting my petition
before the LORD my God concerning His holy mountain— while I was
still praying, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision,
came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice.
He instructed me and spoke with me, saying: “O Daniel, I have come
now to give you insight and understanding. At the beginning of your
petitions, an answer went out, and I have come to tell you, for you
are highly precious. So consider the message and understand the
vision: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Seventy weeks are decreed for your people
and your holy city to stop their transgression, to put an end to sin,
to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting
righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most
Holy Place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Know and understand this: From the
issuance of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem, until the
Messiah, the Prince, there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.
It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of
distress. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah
will be cut off and will have nothing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the people of the prince who is to
come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like
a flood, and until the end there will be war; desolations have been
decreed. And he will confirm a covenant with many for one week, but
in the middle of the week he will put an end to sacrifice and
offering. And on the wing of the temple will come the abomination
that causes desolation, until the decreed destruction is poured out
upon him.” </font>
