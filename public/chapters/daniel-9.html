<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Daniel’s Prayer for His People</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes,<span class="fn">a</span>  a Mede by descent, who was made ruler over the kingdom of the Chaldeans<span class="fn">b</span> —
<span class="reftext">2</span>in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the sacred books, according to the word of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">3</span>So I turned my attention to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and petition, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed, “O, Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant of loving devotion<span class="fn">d</span>  to those who love Him and keep His commandments,
<span class="reftext">5</span>we have sinned and done wrong. We have acted wickedly and rebelled. We have turned away from Your commandments and ordinances.
<span class="reftext">6</span>We have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, leaders, and fathers, and to all the people of the land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>To You, O Lord, belongs righteousness, but this day we are covered with shame—the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, and all Israel near and far, in all the countries to which You have driven us because of our unfaithfulness to You.
<span class="reftext">8</span>O LORD, we are covered with shame—our kings, our leaders, and our fathers—because we have sinned against You.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>To the Lord our God belong compassion and forgiveness, even though we have rebelled against Him
<span class="reftext">10</span>and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God to walk in His laws, which He set before us through His servants the prophets.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>All Israel has transgressed Your law and turned away, refusing to obey Your voice; so the oath and the curse written in the Law of Moses the servant of God has been poured out on us, because we have sinned against You.
<span class="reftext">12</span>You have carried out the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing upon us a great disaster. For under all of heaven, nothing has ever been done like what has been done to Jerusalem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Just as it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us, yet we have not sought the favor of the LORD our God by turning from our iniquities and giving attention to Your truth.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore the LORD has kept the calamity in store and brought it upon us. For the LORD our God is righteous in all He does; yet we have not obeyed His voice.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now, O Lord our God, who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and who made for Yourself a name renowned to this day, we have sinned; we have acted wickedly.
<span class="reftext">16</span>O Lord, in keeping with all Your righteous acts, I pray that Your anger and wrath may turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain; for because of our sins and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people are a reproach to all around us.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So now, our God, hear the prayers and petitions of Your servant. For Your sake, O Lord, cause Your face to shine upon Your desolate sanctuary.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Incline Your ear, O my God, and hear; open Your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears Your name. For we are not presenting our petitions before You because of our righteous acts, but because of Your great compassion.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>O Lord, listen! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, hear and act! For Your sake, O my God, do not delay, because Your city and Your people bear Your name.”
</p><p class="hdg">Gabriel’s Prophecy of the Seventy Weeks</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>While I was speaking, praying, confessing my sin and that of my people Israel, and presenting my petition before the LORD my God concerning His holy mountain—
<span class="reftext">21</span>while I was still praying, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice.
<span class="reftext">22</span>He instructed me and spoke with me, saying: “O Daniel, I have come now to give you insight and understanding.
<span class="reftext">23</span>At the beginning of your petitions, an answer went out, and I have come to tell you, for you are highly precious. So consider the message and understand the vision:
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Seventy weeks<span class="fn">e</span>  are decreed for your people and your holy city to stop their transgression, to put an end to sin, to make atonement for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy Place.<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Know and understand this: From the issuance of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem, until the Messiah,<span class="fn">g</span>  the Prince, there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of distress.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then after the sixty-two weeks<span class="fn">h</span>  the Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing. </p><p class="reg1"> Then the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood, and until the end there will be war; desolations have been decreed.
<span class="reftext">27</span>And he will confirm a covenant with many for one week,<span class="fn">i</span>  but in the middle of the week he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of the temple will come the abomination that causes desolation,<span class="fn">j</span>  until the decreed destruction is poured out upon him.<span class="fn">k</span>”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Ahasuerus</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, the Babylonians<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> See Jeremiah 25:11–12 and Jeremiah 29:10.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">chesed</i> are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as <i class="calibre6">loving devotion</i>; the range of meaning includes <i class="calibre6">love</i>, <i class="calibre6">goodness</i>, <i class="calibre6">kindness</i>, <i class="calibre6">faithfulness</i>, and <i class="calibre6">mercy</i>, as well as <i class="calibre6">loyalty to a covenant</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Seventy sevens</i>; also twice in verse 25 and once in verse 26 <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Holy of Holies</i> or <i class="calibre6">the Most Holy One</i>; literally <i class="calibre6">the Most Holy</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Anointed One</i>; also in verse 26<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Then after sixty-two sevens</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Or <i class="calibre6">for one seven</i>; similarly again in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">And on the wing (will come) the abomination that causes desolation,</i> or <i class="calibre6">And on the wing of abominations (will come) one who causes desolation,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">until the decreed consummation is poured out upon (him who) is desolate.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
