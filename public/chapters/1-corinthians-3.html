<font >Brothers, I could not address you as
spiritual, but as worldly—as infants in Christ. I gave you milk,
not solid food, for you were not yet ready for solid food. In fact,
you are still not ready, for you are still worldly. For since there
is jealousy and dissension among you, are you not worldly? Are you
not walking in the way of man? For when one of you says, “I follow
Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere men? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >What then is Apollos? And what is Paul?
They are servants through whom you believed, as the Lord has assigned
to each his role. I planted the seed and Apollos watered it, but God
made it grow. So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything,
but only God, who makes things grow. He who plants and he who waters
are one in purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own
labor. For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field,
God’s building. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >By the grace God has given me, I laid a
foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it.
But each one must be careful how he builds. For no one can lay a
foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >If anyone builds on this foundation using
gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw, his workmanship
will be evident, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be
revealed with fire, and the fire will prove the quality of each man’s
work. If what he has built survives, he will receive a reward. If it
is burned up, he will suffer loss. He himself will be saved, but only
as if through the flames. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Do you not know that you yourselves are
God’s temple, and that God’s Spirit dwells in you? If anyone
destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is
holy, and you are that temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Let no one deceive himself. If any of you
thinks he is wise in this age, he should become a fool, so that he
may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s
sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness.”
And again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are
futile.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Therefore, stop boasting in men. All
things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or
life or death or the present or the future. All of them belong to
you, and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God. </font>
