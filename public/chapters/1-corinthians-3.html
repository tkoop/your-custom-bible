<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">God’s Fellow Workers<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Hebrews 5:11–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual, but as worldly—as infants in Christ.
<span class="reftext">2</span>I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for solid food. In fact, you are still not ready,
<span class="reftext">3</span>for you are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and dissension among you, are you not worldly? Are you not walking in the way of man?
<span class="reftext">4</span>For when one of you says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere men?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, as the Lord has assigned to each his role.
<span class="reftext">6</span>I planted the seed and Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.
<span class="reftext">8</span>He who plants and he who waters are one in purpose,<span class="fn">a</span>  and each will be rewarded according to his own labour.
<span class="reftext">9</span>For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.
</p><p class="hdg">Christ Our Foundation<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 28:14–22; Ephesians 2:19–22; 1 Peter 2:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one must be careful how he builds.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For no one can lay a foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,
<span class="reftext">13</span>his workmanship will be evident, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will prove the quality of each man’s work.
<span class="reftext">14</span>If what he has built survives, he will receive a reward.
<span class="reftext">15</span>If it is burned up, he will suffer loss. He himself will be saved, but only as if through the flames.
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Temple and God’s Wisdom<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Romans 12:1–8; 1 Corinthians 6:18–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Do you not know that you yourselves are God’s temple, and that God’s Spirit dwells in<span class="fn">b</span>  you?
<span class="reftext">17</span>If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in this age, he should become a fool, so that he may become wise.
<span class="reftext">19</span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Therefore, stop boasting in men. All things are yours,
<span class="reftext">22</span>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas<span class="fn">e</span>  or the world or life or death or the present or the future. All of them belong to you,
<span class="reftext">23</span>and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">are one</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">among</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Job 5:13<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Psalm 94:11<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, Peter<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
