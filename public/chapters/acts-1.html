<font face="Tahoma, serif">In my first book, O Theophilus, I wrote
about all that Jesus began to do and to teach, until the day He was
taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit
to the apostles He had chosen. After His suffering, He presented
Himself to them with many convincing proofs that He was alive. He
appeared to them over a span of forty days and spoke about the
kingdom of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And while they were gathered together, He
commanded them: <font color="#a80000">“Do not leave Jerusalem, but
wait for the gift the Father promised, which you have heard Me
discuss. For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be
baptized with the Holy Spirit.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So when they came together, they asked
Him, “Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“It
is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by
His own authority. But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit
comes upon you, and you will be My witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all
Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After He had said this, they watched as He
was taken up, and a cloud hid Him from their sight. They were looking
intently into the sky as He was going, when suddenly two men dressed
in white stood beside them. “Men of Galilee,” they said, “why
do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been
taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have
seen Him go into heaven.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they returned to Jerusalem from the
Mount of Olives, which is near the city, a Sabbath day’s journey
away. When they arrived, they went to the upper room where they were
staying: Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas,
Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and
Judas son of James. With one accord they all continued in prayer,
along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His
brothers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In those days Peter stood up among the
brothers (a gathering of about a hundred and twenty) and said,
“Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit
foretold through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a
guide for those who arrested Jesus. He was one of our number and
shared in this ministry.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">(Now with the reward for his wickedness
Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong and burst open in the
middle, and all his intestines spilled out. This became known to all
who lived in Jerusalem, so they called that field in their own
language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">For it is written in the book of
Psalms: </font>

‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">May his place be deserted; </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">May another take his position.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore it is necessary to choose one of
the men who have accompanied us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in
and out among us, beginning from John’s baptism until the day Jesus
was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us
of His resurrection.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they proposed two men: Joseph called
Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. And they prayed,
“Lord, You know everyone’s heart. Show us which of these two You
have chosen to take up this ministry and apostleship, which Judas
abandoned to go to his rightful place.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to
Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles. </font>
