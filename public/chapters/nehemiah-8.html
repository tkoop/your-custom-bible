<font ><b>Ezra Reads the Law</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time all the people gathered
together in the square before the Water Gate, and they asked Ezra the
scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had
commanded for Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the first day of the seventh month,
Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women
and all who could listen and understand. So Ezra read it aloud from
daybreak until noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate, in
front of the men and women and those who could understand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And all the people listened attentively to
the Book of the Law. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden
platform built for this occasion. At his right side stood Mattithiah,
Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, and at his left were
Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash-baddanah, Zechariah, and
Meshullam. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ezra opened the book in full view of all
the people, since he was standing above them all, and as he opened
it, all the people stood up. Then Ezra blessed the LORD, the great
God, and with their hands uplifted, all the people said, “Amen,
Amen!” Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces
to the ground. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah,
Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad,
Hanan, and Pelaiah—instructed the people in the Law as they stood
in their places. So they read from the Book of the Law of God,
explaining it and giving insight, so that the people could understand
what was being read. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and
scribe, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to all
of them, “This day is holy to the LORD your God. Do not mourn or
weep.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For all the people were weeping as they
heard the words of the Law. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Nehemiah told them, “Go and eat
what is rich, drink what is sweet, and send out portions to those who
have nothing prepared, since today is holy to our Lord. Do not
grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the Levites calmed all the people,
saying, “Be still, since today is holy. Do not grieve.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then all the people began to eat and
drink, to send out portions, and to rejoice greatly, because they
understood the words that had been made known to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the second day of the month, the heads
of all the families, along with the priests and Levites, gathered
around Ezra the scribe to study the words of the Law. And they found
written in the Law, which the LORD had commanded through Moses, that
the Israelites were to dwell in booths during the feast of the
seventh month. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they proclaimed this message and spread
it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the
hill country and bring back branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle,
palm, and other leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the people went out, brought back
branches, and made booths on their own rooftops, in their courtyards,
in the court of the house of God, and in the squares by the Water
Gate and by the Gate of Ephraim. The whole assembly who had returned
from exile made booths and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son
of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated like this.
And there was great rejoicing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Day after day, from the first day to the
last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. The Israelites kept
the feast for seven days, and on the eighth day they held an
assembly, according to the ordinance. </font>
