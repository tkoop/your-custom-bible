<font ><b>The Broken Covenant</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the word that came to Jeremiah
from the LORD: “Listen to the words of this covenant and tell them
to the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem. You must tell
them that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Cursed is
the man who does not obey the words of this covenant, which I
commanded your forefathers when I brought them out of the land of
Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, ‘Obey Me, and do everything
I command you, and you will be My people, and I will be your God.’
This was in order to establish the oath I swore to your forefathers,
to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is to this
day.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Amen, LORD,” I answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to me, “Proclaim all
these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem,
saying: Hear the words of this covenant and carry them out. For from
the time I brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt until today,
I strongly warned them again and again, saying, ‘Obey My voice.’
Yet they would not obey or incline their ears, but each one followed
the stubbornness of his evil heart. So I brought on them all the
curses of this covenant I had commanded them to follow but they did
not keep.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD told me, “There is a
conspiracy among the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
They have returned to the sins of their forefathers who refused to
obey My words. They have followed other gods to serve them. The house
of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant I made with
their fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I
am about to bring upon them a disaster that they cannot escape. They
will cry out to Me, but I will not listen to them. Then the cities of
Judah and the residents of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods
to which they have been burning incense, but these gods certainly
will not save them in their time of disaster. Your gods are indeed as
numerous as your cities, O Judah; the altars of shame you have set
up—the altars to burn incense to Baal—are as many as the streets
of Jerusalem.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for you, do not pray for these people.
Do not raise up a cry or a prayer on their behalf, for I will not be
listening when they call out to Me in their time of disaster. </font>

<font >Therefore this is what the LORD says
concerning the people of Anathoth who are seeking your life and
saying, “You must not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will
die by our hand.” So this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “I will
punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and
daughters by famine. There will be no remnant, for I will bring
disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”
