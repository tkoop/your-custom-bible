<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Broken Covenant</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>:
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Listen to the words of this covenant and tell them to the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">3</span>You must tell them that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says: Cursed is the man who does not obey the words of this covenant,
<span class="reftext">4</span>which I commanded <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> forefathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, ‘Obey <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, and do everything I command you, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people, and I will be <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God.’
<span class="reftext">5</span>This was in order to establish the oath I swore to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is to this day.” </p><p class="reg1">“Amen, <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>,” I answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear the words of this covenant and carry them out.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For from the time I brought <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers out of the land of Egypt until today, I strongly warned them again and again,<span class="fn">a</span>  saying, ‘Obey <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> voice.’
<span class="reftext">8</span>Yet they would not obey or incline their ears, but each one followed the stubbornness of his evil heart. So I brought on them all the curses of this covenant I had commanded them to follow but they did not keep.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> told me, “There is a conspiracy among the men of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">10</span>They have returned to the sins of their forefathers who refused to obey <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> words. They have followed other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant I made with their fathers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘I am about to bring upon them a disaster that they cannot escape. They will cry out to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, but I will not listen to them.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then the cities of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to which they have been burning incense, but these gods certainly will not save them in their time of disaster.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Your gods are indeed as numerous as your cities, O Judah; the altars of shame <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have set up—the altars to burn incense to Baal—are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>As for you, do not pray for these people. Do not raise up a cry or a prayer on their behalf, for I will not be listening when they call out to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> in their time of disaster.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>What right has <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> beloved in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> house, </p><p class="indent"> having carried out so many evil schemes? </p><p class="indent1"> Can consecrated meat avert your doom, </p><p class="indent"> so that you can rejoice?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> once called you a flourishing olive tree, </p><p class="indent"> beautiful with well-formed fruit. </p><p class="indent1"> But with a mighty roar <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will set it on fire, </p><p class="indent"> and its branches will be consumed.
</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> of Hosts, who planted you, has decreed disaster against you on account of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have brought upon themselves, provoking <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to anger by burning incense to Baal.”
</p><p class="hdg">A Plot against Jeremiah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jeremiah 18:18–23)</span></p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> informed me, so I knew. </p><p class="indent"> Then <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> showed me their deeds.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>For I was like a gentle lamb led to slaughter; </p><p class="indent"> I did not know that they had plotted against me: </p><p class="indent1">“Let us destroy the tree with its fruit; </p><p class="indent"> let us cut him off from the land of the living, </p><p class="indent"> that his name may be remembered no more.”

<span class="reftext">22</span>So this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: “I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine.
<span class="reftext">23</span>There will be no remnant, for I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">I earnestly warned them, rising up early and warning (them),</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the kidneys</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
