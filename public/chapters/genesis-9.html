dread of you will fall on every living creature on the earth, every
bird of the air, every creature that crawls on the ground, and all
the fish of the sea. They are delivered into your hand. Everything
that lives and moves will be food for you; just as I gave you the
green plants, I now give you all things. But you must not eat meat
with its lifeblood still in it. And surely I will require the life of
any man or beast by whose hand your lifeblood is shed. I will demand
an accounting from anyone who takes the life of his fellow man: </font>
