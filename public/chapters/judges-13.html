<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Birth of Samson<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 6:1–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD, so He delivered them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Now there was a man from Zorah named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, whose wife was barren and had no children.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The angel<span class="fn">a</span>  of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “It is true that you are barren and have no children; but you will conceive and give birth to a son.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Now please be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and not to eat anything unclean.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. And no razor shall come over his head, because the boy will be a Nazirite<span class="fn">b</span>  to God from the womb, and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So the woman went and told her husband, “A man of God came to me. His appearance was like the angel of God, exceedingly awesome. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.
<span class="reftext">7</span>But he said to me, ‘Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. Now, therefore, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, “Please, O Lord, let the man of God You sent us come to us again to teach us how to raise the boy who is to be born.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God returned to the woman as she was sitting in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.
<span class="reftext">10</span>The woman ran quickly to tell her husband, “Behold, the man who came to me the other day has reappeared!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?” </p><p class="reg1">“I am,” he said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Manoah asked, “When your words come to pass, what will be the boy’s rule of life and mission?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So the angel of the LORD answered Manoah, “Your wife is to do everything I told her.
<span class="reftext">14</span>She must not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor drink any wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>“Please stay here,” Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “and we will prepare a young goat for you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And the angel of the LORD replied, “Even if I stay, I will not eat your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD.” For Manoah did not know that it was the angel of the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, “What is your name, so that we may <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> you when your word comes to pass?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>“Why do you ask my name,” said the angel of the LORD, “since it is beyond comprehension?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the LORD. And as Manoah and his wife looked on, the LORD did a <span class='spell ca'>marvellous</span><span class='spell gb'>marvellous</span><span class='spell us'>marvelous</span> thing.
<span class="reftext">20</span>When the flame went up from the altar to the sky, the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame. </p><p class="reg1"> When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell facedown to the ground.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And when the angel of the LORD did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that it had been the angel of the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>“We are going to die,” he said to his wife, “for we have seen God!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But his wife replied, “If the LORD had intended to kill us, He would not have accepted the burnt offering and the grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things or spoken to us this way.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The boy grew, and the LORD blessed him.
<span class="reftext">25</span>And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him at Mahaneh-dan,<span class="fn">c</span>  between Zorah and Eshtaol.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i>; here and throughout chapter 13; corresponding pronouns may also be capitalized.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">set apart</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Mahaneh-dan</i> means <i class="calibre6">camp of Dan</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
