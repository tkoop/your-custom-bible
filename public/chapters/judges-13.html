<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Birth of Samson<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 6:1–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Again the Israelites did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, so <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> delivered them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Now there was a man from Zorah named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, whose wife was barren and had no children.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The angel<span class="fn">a</span>  of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> appeared to the woman and said to her, “It is true that you are barren and have no children; but you will conceive and give birth to a son.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Now please be careful not to drink wine or strong drink, and not to eat anything unclean.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. And no razor shall come over his head, because the boy will be a Nazirite<span class="fn">b</span>  to God from the womb, and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So the woman went and told her husband, “A man of God came to me. His appearance was like the angel of God, exceedingly awesome. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.
<span class="reftext">7</span>But he said to me, ‘Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. Now, therefore, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Manoah prayed to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “Please, O Lord, let the man of God <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> sent us come to us again to teach us how to raise the boy who is to be born.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God returned to the woman as she was sitting in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.
<span class="reftext">10</span>The woman ran quickly to tell her husband, “Behold, the man who came to me the other day has reappeared!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?” </p><p class="reg1">“I am,” he said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Manoah asked, “When your words come to pass, what will be the boy’s rule of life and mission?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> answered Manoah, “Your wife is to do everything I told her.
<span class="reftext">14</span>She must not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor drink any wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>“Please stay here,” Manoah said to the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “and we will prepare a young goat for you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> replied, “Even if I stay, I will not eat your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.” For Manoah did not know that it was the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then Manoah said to the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “What is your name, so that we may <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> you when your word comes to pass?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>“Why do you ask my name,” said the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “since it is beyond comprehension?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. And as Manoah and his wife looked on, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> did a <span class='spell ca'>marvellous</span><span class='spell gb'>marvellous</span><span class='spell us'>marvelous</span> thing.
<span class="reftext">20</span>When the flame went up from the altar to the sky, the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> ascended in the flame. </p><p class="reg1"> When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell facedown to the ground.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And when the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that it had been the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>“We are going to die,” he said to his wife, “for we have seen God!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But his wife replied, “If <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had intended to kill us, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> would not have accepted the burnt offering and the grain offering from our hands, nor would <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> have shown us all these things or spoken to us this way.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The boy grew, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> blessed him.
<span class="reftext">25</span>And the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> began to stir him at Mahaneh-dan,<span class="fn">c</span>  between Zorah and Eshtaol.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i>; here and throughout chapter 13; corresponding pronouns may also be capitalized.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">set apart</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Mahaneh-dan</i> means <i class="calibre6">camp of Dan</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
