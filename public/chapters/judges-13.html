<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Birth of Samson</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Again the Israelites did evil in the sight
of the LORD, so He delivered them into the hand of the Philistines
for forty years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now there was a man from Zorah named
Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, whose wife was barren and had
no children. The angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to
her, “It is true that you are barren and have no children; but you
will conceive and give birth to a son. Now please be careful not to
drink wine or strong drink, and not to eat anything unclean. For
behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son. And no razor shall
come over his head, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from
the womb, and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hand
of the Philistines.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the woman went and told her husband, “A
man of God came to me. His appearance was like the angel of God,
exceedingly awesome. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did
not tell me his name. But he said to me, ‘Behold, you will conceive
and give birth to a son. Now, therefore, do not drink wine or strong
drink, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a
Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, “Please,
O Lord, let the man of God You sent us come to us again to teach us
how to raise the boy who is to be born.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And God listened to the voice of Manoah,
and the angel of God returned to the woman as she was sitting in the
field; but her husband Manoah was not with her. The woman ran quickly
to tell her husband, “Behold, the man who came to me the other day
has reappeared!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Manoah got up and followed his wife.
When he came to the man, he asked, “Are you the man who spoke to my
wife?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am,” he said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Manoah asked, “When your words come
to pass, what will be the boy’s rule of life and mission?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the angel of the LORD answered Manoah,
“Your wife is to do everything I told her. She must not eat
anything that comes from the vine, nor drink any wine or strong
drink, nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have
commanded her.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Please stay here,” Manoah said to the
angel of the LORD, “and we will prepare a young goat for you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the angel of the LORD replied, “Even
if I stay, I will not eat your food. But if you prepare a burnt
offering, offer it to the LORD.” For Manoah did not know that it
was the angel of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD,
“What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes
to pass?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Why do you ask my name,” said the
angel of the LORD, “since it is beyond comprehension?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain
offering and offered them on a rock to the LORD. And as Manoah and
his wife looked on, the LORD did a marvelous thing. When the flame
went up from the altar to the sky, the angel of the LORD ascended in
the flame. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Manoah and his wife saw this, they
fell facedown to the ground. And when the angel of the LORD did not
appear again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it had been
the angel of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">We are going to die,” he said to his
wife, “for we have seen God!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But his wife replied, “If the LORD had
intended to kill us, He would not have accepted the burnt offering
and the grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all
these things or spoken to us this way.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the woman gave birth to a son and named
him Samson. The boy grew, and the LORD blessed him. And the Spirit of
the LORD began to stir him at Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
