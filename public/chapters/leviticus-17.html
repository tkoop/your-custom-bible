<span class="reftext">11</span>For the life<span class="fn">c</span>  of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for your souls upon the altar; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore I say to the Israelites, ‘None of you may eat blood, nor may any foreigner living among you eat blood.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And if any Israelite or foreigner living among them hunts down a wild animal or bird that may be eaten, he must drain its blood and cover it with dirt.
<span class="reftext">14</span>For the life of all flesh is its blood. Therefore I have told the Israelites, ‘You must not eat the blood of any living thing, because the life of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it must be cut off.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And any person, whether native or foreigner, who eats anything found dead or mauled by wild beasts must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he will be unclean until evening; then he will be clean.
