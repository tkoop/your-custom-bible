Truly I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, they already have their full reward.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
<span class="reftext">4</span>so that your giving may be in secret. And your <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

<span class="reftext">6</span>But when you pray, go into your inner room, shut your door, and pray to your <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>, who is unseen.

</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">7</span>And when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> pray, do not babble on like pagans, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Do not be like them, for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> knows what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> need before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> ask <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.

Truly I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, they already have their full reward.
<span class="reftext">17</span>But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,
<span class="reftext">18</span>so that your fasting will not be obvious to men, but only to your <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>, who is unseen. And your <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

<span class="reftext">20</span>But store up for yourselves treasures in <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.

<span class="reftext">23</span>But if your eyes are bad,<span class="fn">e</span>  your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">24</span>No one can serve two masters: Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> cannot serve both God and money.
</p><p class="hdg">Do Not Worry<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 12:22–31)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">25</span>Therefore I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, do not worry about <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> life, what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will eat or drink; or about <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> body, what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?
<span class="reftext">26</span>Look at the birds of the air: They do not sow or reap or gather into barns—and yet <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> heavenly <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> feeds them. Are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not much more valuable than they?
<span class="reftext">27</span>Who of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> by worrying can add a single hour to his life?<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>And why do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> worry about clothes? Consider how the lilies of the field grow: They do not <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> or spin.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Yet I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> that not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these.
<span class="reftext">30</span>If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> not much more clothe <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, O <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> of little faith?
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’
<span class="reftext">32</span>For the Gentiles strive after all these things, and <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> heavenly <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> knows that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> need them.
<span class="reftext">33</span>But seek first the kingdom of God<span class="fn">g</span>  and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> righteousness, and all these things will be added unto <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">34</span>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.
