<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Elihu Rebukes Job’s Friends</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>This kindled the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram. He burned with anger against Job for justifying himself rather than God,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and he burned with anger against Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he.
<span class="reftext">5</span>But when he saw that the three men had no further reply, his anger was kindled.
<span class="reftext">6</span>So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite declared: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I am young in years, </p><p class="indent"> while you are old; </p><p class="indent1"> that is why I was timid and afraid </p><p class="indent"> to tell you what I know.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>I thought that age should speak, </p><p class="indent"> and many years should teach wisdom.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But there is a spirit<span class="fn">a</span>  in a man, </p><p class="indent"> the breath of the Almighty, </p><p class="indent"> that gives him understanding.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>It is not only the old<span class="fn">b</span>  who are wise, </p><p class="indent"> or the elderly who understand justice.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; </p><p class="indent"> I too will declare what I know.’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>Indeed, I waited while you spoke; </p><p class="indent"> I listened to your reasoning; </p><p class="indent1"> as you searched for words,
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">12</span>I paid you full attention. </p><p class="indent1"> But no one proved Job wrong; </p><p class="indent"> not one of you rebutted his arguments.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So do not claim, ‘We have found wisdom; </p><p class="indent"> let God, not man, refute him.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But Job has not directed his words against me, </p><p class="indent"> and I will not answer him with your arguments.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>Job’s friends are dismayed, with no more to say; </p><p class="indent"> words have escaped them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Must I wait, now that they are silent, </p><p class="indent"> now that they stand and no longer reply?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>I too will answer; </p><p class="indent"> yes, I will declare what I know.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>For I am full of words, </p><p class="indent"> and my spirit within me compels me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Behold, my belly is like unvented wine; </p><p class="indent"> it is about to burst like a new wineskin.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>I must speak and find relief; </p><p class="indent"> I must open my lips and respond.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>I will be partial to no one, </p><p class="indent"> nor will I flatter any man.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>For I do not know how to flatter, </p><p class="indent"> or my Maker would remove me in an instant.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Spirit</i>; also in verse 18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">many</i> or <i class="calibre6">great</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
