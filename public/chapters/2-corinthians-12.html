<font face="Tahoma, serif">I must go on boasting. Although there is
nothing to gain, I will go on to visions and revelations from the
Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to
the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of it I do not
know, but God knows. And I know that this man—whether in the body
or out of it I do not know, but God knows— was caught up to
Paradise. The things he heard were too sacred for words, things that
man is not permitted to tell. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will boast about such a man, but I will
not boast about myself, except in my weaknesses. Even if I wanted to
boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth.
But I refrain, so no one will credit me with more than he sees in me
or hears from me, or because of these surpassingly great revelations.

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So to keep me from becoming conceited, I
was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.
Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. But He
said to me, <font color="#a80000">“My grace is sufficient for you,
for My power is perfected in weakness.”</font> Therefore I will
boast all the more gladly in my weaknesses, so that the power of
Christ may rest on me. That is why, for the sake of Christ, I delight
in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in
difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I have become a fool, but you drove me to
it. In fact, you should have commended me, since I am in no way
inferior to those “super-apostles,” even though I am nothing. The
true marks of an apostle—signs, wonders, and miracles—were
performed among you with great perseverance. In what way were you
inferior to the other churches, except that I was not a burden to
you? Forgive me this wrong! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">See, I am ready to come to you a third
time, and I will not be a burden, because I am not seeking your
possessions, but you. For children should not have to save up for
their parents, but parents for their children. And for the sake of
your souls, I will most gladly spend my money and myself. If I love
you more, will you love me less? </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Be that as it may, I was not a burden to
you; but crafty as I am, I caught you by trickery. Did I exploit you
by anyone I sent you? I urged Titus to visit you, and I sent our
brother with him. Did Titus exploit you in any way? Did we not walk
in the same Spirit and follow in the same footsteps? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Have you been thinking all along that we
were making a defense to you? We speak before God in Christ, and all
of this, beloved, is to build you up. For I am afraid that when I
come, I may not find you as I wish, and you may not find me as you
wish. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, rage, rivalry,
slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder. I am afraid that when I
come again, my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved
over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of their acts
of impurity, sexual immorality, and debauchery. </font>
