<font ><b>The Failure to Complete the Conquest</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After the death of Joshua, the Israelites
inquired of the LORD, “Who will be the first to go up and fight for
us against the Canaanites?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Judah shall go up,” answered the
LORD. “Indeed, I have delivered the land into their hands.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the men of Judah said to their
brothers the Simeonites, “Come up with us to our allotted
territory, and let us fight against the Canaanites. And we likewise
will go with you to your territory.” So the Simeonites went with
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Judah attacked, the LORD delivered
the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down
ten thousand men at Bezek. And there they found Adoni-bezek and
fought against him, striking down the Canaanites and Perizzites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Adoni-bezek fled, they pursued him,
seized him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes. Then Adoni-bezek
said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have
gathered the scraps under my table. As I have done to them, so God
has repaid me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the men of Judah fought against
Jerusalem and captured it. They put the city to the sword and set it
on fire. Afterward, the men of Judah marched down to fight against
the Canaanites living in the hill country, in the Negev, and in the
foothills. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Judah also marched against the Canaanites
who were living in Hebron (formerly known as Kiriath-arba), and they
struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From there they marched against the
inhabitants of Debir (formerly known as Kiriath-sepher). And Caleb
said, “To the man who strikes down Kiriath-sepher and captures it,
I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage.” So Othniel son of
Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz captured the city, and Caleb gave his
daughter Acsah to him in marriage. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One day Acsah came to Othniel and urged
him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb
asked her, “What do you desire?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Give me a blessing,” she answered.
“Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me springs of
water as well.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower
springs. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the descendants of Moses’
father-in-law, the Kenite, went up with the men of Judah from the
City of Palms to the Wilderness of Judah in the Negev near Arad. They
went to live among the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the men of Judah went with their
brothers the Simeonites, attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath,
and devoted the city to destruction. So it was called Hormah. And
Judah also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron—each with its
territory. The LORD was with Judah, and they took possession of the
hill country; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the
plains because they had chariots of iron. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Just as Moses had promised, Judah gave
Hebron to Caleb, who drove out the descendants of the three sons of
Anak. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Benjamites, however, failed to drive
out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. So to this day the Jebusites
live there among the Benjamites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The house of Joseph also attacked Bethel,
and the LORD was with them. They sent spies to Bethel (formerly known
as Luz), and when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they
said to him, “Please show us how to get into the city, and we will
treat you kindly.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the man showed them the entrance to the
city, and they put the city to the sword but released that man and
all his family. And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a
city, and called it Luz, which is its name to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Manasseh failed to drive out
the inhabitants of Beth-shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and
their villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that
land. When Israel became stronger, they pressed the Canaanites into
forced labor, but they never drove them out completely. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ephraim also failed to drive out the
Canaanites living in Gezer; so the Canaanites continued to dwell
among them in Gezer. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Zebulun failed to drive out the
inhabitants of Kitron and Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them
and served as forced laborers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Asher failed to drive out the inhabitants
of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob. So the
Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, because
they did not drive them out. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Naphtali failed to drive out the
inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath. So the Naphtalites also
lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, but the
inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath served them as forced
laborers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Amorites forced the Danites into the
hill country and did not allow them to come down into the plain. And
the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and
Shaalbim. But when the house of Joseph grew in strength, they pressed
the Amorites into forced labor. And the border of the Amorites
extended from the Ascent of Akrabbim to Sela and beyond. </font>
