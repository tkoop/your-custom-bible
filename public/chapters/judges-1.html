<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Conquest of Canaan Proceeds<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Joshua 13:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “Who will be the first to go up and fight for us against the Canaanites?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Judah shall go up,” answered <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. “Indeed, I have delivered the land into their hands.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then the men of Judah said to their brothers the Simeonites, “Come up with us to our allotted territory, and let us fight against the Canaanites. And we likewise will go with you to your territory.” So the Simeonites went with them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When Judah attacked, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And there they found Adoni-bezek and fought against him, striking down the Canaanites and Perizzites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>As Adoni-bezek fled, they pursued him, seized him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have gathered the scraps under my table. As I have done to them, so God has repaid me.” And they brought him to Jerusalem, where he died.
</p><p class="hdg">The Capture of Jerusalem and Hebron<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Joshua 15:13–19)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Afterward, the men of Judah marched down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, in the Negev, and in the foothills.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Judah also marched against the Canaanites who were living in Hebron (formerly known as Kiriath-arba), and they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>From there they marched against the inhabitants of Debir (formerly known as Kiriath-sepher).
<span class="reftext">12</span>And Caleb said, “To the man who strikes down Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage.”
<span class="reftext">13</span>So Othniel son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz captured the city, and Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>One day Acsah came to Othniel and urged him<span class="fn">b</span>  to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you desire?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>“Give me a blessing,” she answered. “Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me springs of water as well.” </p><p class="reg1"> So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Now the descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went up with the men of Judah from the City of Palms<span class="fn">c</span>  to the Wilderness of Judah in the Negev near Arad. They went to live among the people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then the men of Judah went with their brothers the Simeonites, attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and devoted the city to destruction.<span class="fn">d</span>  So it was called Hormah.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And Judah also captured<span class="fn">f</span>  Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron—each with its territory.
<span class="reftext">19</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> was with Judah, and they took possession of the hill country; but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plains because they had chariots of iron.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Just as Moses had promised, Judah gave Hebron to Caleb, who drove out the descendants of the three sons of Anak.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>The Benjamites, however, failed to drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. So to this day the Jebusites live there among the Benjamites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>The house of Joseph also attacked Bethel, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was with them.
<span class="reftext">23</span>They sent spies to Bethel (formerly known as Luz),
<span class="reftext">24</span>and when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, “Please show us how to get into the city, and we will treat you kindly.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>So the man showed them the entrance to the city, and they put the city to the sword but released that man and all his family.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called it Luz, which is its name to this day.
</p><p class="hdg">The Failure to Complete the Conquest</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>At that time Manasseh failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and their villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land.
<span class="reftext">28</span>When Israel became stronger, they pressed the Canaanites into forced <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>, but they never drove them out completely.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Ephraim also failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer; so the Canaanites continued to dwell among them in Gezer.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Zebulun failed to drive out the inhabitants of Kitron and Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them and served as forced <span class='spell ca'>labourers</span><span class='spell gb'>labourers</span><span class='spell us'>laborers</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Asher failed to drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob.
<span class="reftext">32</span>So the Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, because they did not drive them out.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Naphtali failed to drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath. So the Naphtalites also lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath served them as forced <span class='spell ca'>labourers</span><span class='spell gb'>labourers</span><span class='spell us'>laborers</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>The Amorites forced the Danites into the hill country and did not allow them to come down into the plain.
<span class="reftext">35</span>And the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But when the house of Joseph grew in strength, they pressed the Amorites into forced <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>.
<span class="reftext">36</span>And the border of the Amorites extended from the Ascent of Akrabbim<span class="fn">g</span>  to Sela and beyond.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Shephelah</i> or <i class="calibre6">lowlands</i>; that is, the western foothills of Judea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew; LXX and Vulgate <i class="calibre6">and he urged her</i>; see Joshua 15:18.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, Jericho<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">cherem</i> refer to the giving over of things or persons to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Hormah</i> means <i class="calibre6">destruction</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Hebrew; LXX <i class="calibre6">But Judah did not capture</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Ascent of Scorpions</i> or <i class="calibre6">Scorpion Pass</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
