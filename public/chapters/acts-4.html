<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Peter and John before the Sanhedrin</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>While Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them,
<span class="reftext">2</span>greatly disturbed that they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
<span class="reftext">3</span>They seized Peter and John, and because it was evening, they put them in custody until the next day.
<span class="reftext">4</span>But many who heard the message believed, and the number of men grew to about five thousand.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The next day the rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem,
<span class="reftext">6</span>along with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and many others from the high priest’s family.
<span class="reftext">7</span>They had Peter and John brought in and began to question them: “By what power or what name did <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do this?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Peter, filled with the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, said to them, “Rulers and elders of the people!
<span class="reftext">9</span>If we are being examined today about a kind service to a man who was lame, to determine how he was healed,
<span class="reftext">10</span>then let this be known to all of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and to all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> healed.
<span class="reftext">11</span>This Jesus is </p><p class="indent1stline">‘the stone <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> builders rejected, </p><p class="indent"> which has become the cornerstone.’<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Salvation exists in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Name Forbidden</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>When they saw the boldness of Peter and John and <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they <span class='spell ca'>marvelled</span><span class='spell gb'>marvelled</span><span class='spell us'>marveled</span> and took note that these men had been with Jesus.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And seeing the man who had been healed standing there with them, they had nothing to say in response.
<span class="reftext">15</span>So they ordered them to leave the Sanhedrin<span class="fn">b</span>  and then conferred together.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>“What shall we do with these men?” they asked. “It is clear to everyone living in Jerusalem that a remarkable miracle has occurred through them, and we cannot deny it.
<span class="reftext">17</span>But to keep this message from spreading any further among the people, we must warn them not to speak to anyone in this name.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But Peter and John replied, “Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God’s sight to listen to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> rather than God.
<span class="reftext">20</span>For we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>After further threats they let them go. They could not find a way to punish them, because all the people were glorifying God for what had happened.
<span class="reftext">22</span>For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.

<span class="reftext">24</span>When the believers heard this, they lifted up their voices to God with one accord. “Sovereign Lord,” they said, “You made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
<span class="reftext">25</span>You spoke by the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> through the mouth of <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> servant,<span class="fn">c</span>  our father David: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Why do the nations rage </p><p class="indent"> and the peoples plot in vain?

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>In fact, this is the very city where Herod and Pontius Pilate conspired with the Gentiles and the people of Israel against <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> holy servant Jesus, whom <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> anointed.
<span class="reftext">28</span>They carried out what <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> hand and will had decided beforehand would happen.
<span class="reftext">29</span>And now, Lord, consider their threats, and enable <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> servants to speak <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> word with complete boldness,
<span class="reftext">30</span>as <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> stretch out <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> holy servant Jesus.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>After they had prayed, their meeting place was shaken, and they were all filled with the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> and spoke the word of God boldly.

<span class="reftext">33</span>With great power the apostles continued to give their testimony about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And abundant grace was upon them all.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>There were no needy ones among them, because those who owned lands or houses would sell their property, bring the proceeds from the sales,
<span class="reftext">35</span>and lay them at the apostles’ feet for distribution to anyone as he had need.
