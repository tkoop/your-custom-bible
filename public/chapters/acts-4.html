<font >While Peter and John were speaking to the
people, the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the
Sadducees came up to them, greatly disturbed that they were teaching
the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
They seized Peter and John, and because it was evening, they put them
in custody until the next day. But many who heard the message
believed, and the number of men grew to about five thousand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day the rulers, elders, and
scribes assembled in Jerusalem, along with Annas the high priest,
Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and many others from the high priest’s
family. They had Peter and John brought in and began to question
them: “By what power or what name did you do this?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit,
said to them, “Rulers and elders of the people! If we are being
examined today about a kind service to a man who was lame, to
determine how he was healed, then let this be known to all of you and
to all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that
this man stands before you healed. This Jesus is </font>

‘<font >the stone you builders rejected, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >which has become the cornerstone.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Salvation exists in no one else, for there
is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be
saved.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they saw the boldness of Peter and
John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they
marveled and took note that these men had been with Jesus. And seeing
the man who had been healed standing there with them, they had
nothing to say in response. So they ordered them to leave the
Sanhedrin and then conferred together. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What shall we do with these men?”
they asked. “It is clear to everyone living in Jerusalem that a
remarkable miracle has occurred through them, and we cannot deny it.
But to keep this message from spreading any further among the people,
we must warn them not to speak to anyone in this name.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they called them in again and
commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. But
Peter and John replied, “Judge for yourselves whether it is right
in God’s sight to listen to you rather than God. For we cannot stop
speaking about what we have seen and heard.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After further threats they let them go.
They could not find a way to punish them, because all the people were
glorifying God for what had happened. For the man who was
miraculously healed was over forty years old. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On their release, Peter and John returned
to their own people and reported everything that the chief priests
and elders had said to them. When the believers heard this, they
lifted up their voices to God with one accord. “Sovereign Lord,”
they said, “You made the heaven and the earth and the sea and
everything in them. You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of
Your servant, our father David: </font>

<font >In fact, this is the very city where Herod
and Pontius Pilate conspired with the Gentiles and the people of
Israel against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed. They
carried out what Your hand and will had decided beforehand would
happen. And now, Lord, consider their threats, and enable Your
servants to speak Your word with complete boldness, as You stretch
out Your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name
of Your holy servant Jesus.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After they had prayed, their meeting place
was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke
the word of God boldly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The multitude of believers was one in
heart and soul. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his
own, but they shared everything they owned. With great power the
apostles continued to give their testimony about the resurrection of
the Lord Jesus. And abundant grace was upon them all. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There were no needy ones among them,
because those who owned lands or houses would sell their property,
bring the proceeds from the sales, and lay them at the apostles’
feet for distribution to anyone as he had need. </font>

<font >Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the
apostles called Barnabas (meaning Son of Encouragement), sold a field
he owned, brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet. </font>
