<font ><b>The Fall of Jerusalem</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz
son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when
he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And the
king of Egypt dethroned him in Jerusalem and imposed on Judah a levy
of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Neco king of Egypt made Eliakim
brother of Jehoahaz king over Judah and Jerusalem, and he changed
Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Eliakim’s brother
Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when
he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. And he did
evil in the sight of the LORD his God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came
up against Jehoiakim and bound him with bronze shackles to take him
to Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar also took to Babylon some of the articles
from the house of the LORD, and he put them in his temple in Babylon.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim,
the abominations he committed, and all that was found against him,
they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
And his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days.
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the spring, King Nebuchadnezzar
summoned Jehoiachin and brought him to Babylon, along with the
articles of value from the house of the LORD. And he made
Jehoiachin’s relative Zedekiah king over Judah and Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. And he did
evil in the sight of the LORD his God and did not humble himself
before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke for the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He also rebelled against King
Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God. But Zedekiah stiffened
his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD, the God
of Israel. Furthermore, all the leaders of the priests and the people
multiplied their unfaithful deeds, following all the abominations of
the nations, and they defiled the house of the LORD, which He had
consecrated in Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again and again the LORD, the God of their
fathers, sent word to His people through His messengers because He
had compassion on them and on His dwelling place. But they mocked the
messengers of God, despising His words and scoffing at His prophets,
until the wrath of the LORD against His people was stirred up beyond
remedy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So He brought up against them the king of
the Chaldeans, who put their young men to the sword in the sanctuary,
sparing neither young men nor young women, neither elderly nor
infirm. God gave them all into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, who
carried off everything to Babylon—all the articles of the house of
God, both large and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD
and of the king and his officials. Then the Chaldeans set fire to the
house of God and broke down the wall of Jerusalem. They burned down
all the palaces and destroyed every article of value. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Those who escaped the sword were carried
by Nebuchadnezzar into exile in Babylon, and they became servants to
him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia came to power. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the land enjoyed its Sabbath rest all
the days of the desolation, until seventy years were completed, in
fulfillment of the word of the LORD through Jeremiah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia,
to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah, the LORD
stirred the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia to send a proclamation
throughout his kingdom and to put it in writing as follows: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
