<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Presumptuous Proverb</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, you are living in a rebellious house. They
have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear,
for they are a rebellious house. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, son of man, pack your bags for
exile. In broad daylight, set out from your place and go to another
as they watch. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a
rebellious house. Bring out your baggage for exile by day, as they
watch. Then in the evening, as they watch, go out like those who go
into exile. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As they watch, dig through the wall and
carry your belongings out through it. And as they watch, lift your
bags to your shoulder and take them out at dusk; cover your face so
that you cannot see the land. For I have made you a sign to the house
of Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I did as I was commanded. I brought out
my bags for exile by day, and in the evening I dug through the wall
by hand. I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my
shoulder as they watched. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And in the morning the word of the LORD
came to me, saying, “Son of man, hasn’t the rebellious house of
Israel asked you, ‘What are you doing?’ Tell them that this is
what the Lord GOD says: ‘This burden concerns the prince in
Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are there.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You are to say, ‘I am a sign to you.’
Just as it happened here, so will it be done to them; they will go
into exile as captives. And at dusk the prince among them will lift
his bags to his shoulder and go out. They will dig through the wall
to bring him out. He will cover his face so he cannot see the land.
But I will spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My snare.
I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will
not see it, and there he will die. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And I will scatter to every wind all the
attendants around him and all his troops, and I will draw a sword to
chase after them. And they will know that I am the LORD, when I
disperse them among the nations and scatter them throughout the
countries. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But I will spare a few of them from sword
and famine and plague, so that in the nations to which they go, they
can recount all their abominations. Then they will know that I am the
LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, eat your bread with trembling, and drink your
water with quivering and anxiety. Then tell the people of the land
that this is what the Lord GOD says about those living in Jerusalem
and in the land of Israel: ‘They will eat their bread with anxiety
and drink their water in dread, for their land will be stripped of
everything in it because of the violence of all who dwell in it. The
inhabited cities will be laid waste, and the land will become
desolate. Then you will know that I am the LORD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Again the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land
of Israel: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">The days go by, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">and every vision fails’? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore tell them that this is what the
Lord GOD says: ‘I will put an end to this proverb, and in Israel
they will no longer recite it.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But say to them: ‘The days are at hand
when every vision will be fulfilled. For there will be no more false
visions or flattering divinations within the house of Israel, because
I, the LORD, will speak whatever word I speak, and it will be
fulfilled without delay. For in your days, O rebellious house, I will
speak a message and bring it to pass, declares the Lord GOD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Furthermore, the word of the LORD came to
me, saying, “Son of man, take note that the house of Israel is
saying, ‘The vision that he sees is for many years from now; he
prophesies about the distant future.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore tell them that this is what the
Lord GOD says: ‘None of My words will be delayed any longer. The
message I speak will be fulfilled, declares the Lord GOD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
