<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Temple Construction Begins<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 3:1–2)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the four hundred and eightieth<span class="fn">a</span>  year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt, in the month of Ziv,<span class="fn">b</span>  the second month of the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, he began to build the house of the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">3</span>The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple was twenty cubits<span class="fn">d</span>  long, extending across the width of the temple and projecting out ten cubits<span class="fn">e</span>  in front of the temple.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>He also had narrow windows framed high in the temple.
</p><p class="hdg">The Chambers</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Against the walls of the temple and the inner sanctuary, Solomon built a chambered structure around the temple, in which he constructed the side rooms.
<span class="reftext">6</span>The bottom floor was five cubits wide,<span class="fn">f</span>  the middle floor six cubits,<span class="fn">g</span>  and the third floor seven cubits.<span class="fn">h</span>  He also placed offset ledges around the outside of the temple, so that nothing would be inserted into its walls.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>The temple was constructed using finished stones cut at the quarry, so that no hammer or chisel or any other iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>The entrance to the bottom<span class="fn">i</span>  floor was on the south side of the temple. A stairway led up to the middle level, and from there to the third floor.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So Solomon built the temple and finished it, roofing it with beams and planks of cedar.
<span class="reftext">10</span>He built chambers all along the temple, each five cubits high and attached to the temple with beams of cedar.
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Promise to Solomon</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying:
<span class="reftext">12</span>“As for this temple you are building, if you walk in My statutes, carry out My ordinances, and keep all My commandments by walking in them, I will <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> through you the promise I made to your father David.
<span class="reftext">13</span>And I will dwell among the Israelites and will not abandon My people Israel.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Temple’s Interior<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 3:5–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So Solomon built the temple and finished it.
<span class="reftext">15</span>He lined the interior walls with cedar paneling from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and he covered the floor with cypress<span class="fn">j</span>  boards.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>He partitioned off the twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.<span class="fn">k</span> 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long.<span class="fn">l</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>The cedar paneling inside the temple was carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; not a stone could be seen.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Solomon also prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there.
<span class="reftext">20</span>The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar.<span class="fn">m</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains<span class="fn">n</span>  across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold.
<span class="reftext">22</span>So he overlaid with gold the whole interior of the temple, until everything was completely finished. He also overlaid with gold the entire altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.
</p><p class="hdg">The Cherubim<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 3:10–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim, each ten cubits high, out of olive wood.
<span class="reftext">24</span>One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing was five cubits long as well. So the full wingspan was ten cubits.
<span class="reftext">25</span>The second cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same size and shape,
<span class="reftext">26</span>and the height of each cherub was ten cubits.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>And he placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple. Since their wings were spread out, the wing of the first cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the second cherub touched the other wall, and in the middle of the room their wingtips touched.
<span class="reftext">28</span>He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Then he carved the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer sanctuaries, with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.
<span class="reftext">30</span>And he overlaid the temple floor with gold in both the inner and outer sanctuaries.
</p><p class="hdg">The Doors</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, Solomon constructed doors of olive wood with five-sided doorposts.
<span class="reftext">32</span>The double doors were made of olive wood, and he carved into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>In the same way he made four-sided doorposts of olive wood for the sanctuary entrance.
<span class="reftext">34</span>The two doors were made of cypress wood, and each had two folding panels.
<span class="reftext">35</span>He carved into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold, hammered evenly over the carvings.
</p><p class="hdg">The Courtyard</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Solomon built the inner courtyard with three rows of dressed stone and one row of trimmed cedar beams.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>The foundation of the house of the LORD was laid in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, in the month of Ziv.
<span class="reftext">38</span>In his eleventh year and eighth month, the month of Bul,<span class="fn">o</span>  the temple was finished in every detail and according to every specification. So he built the temple in seven years.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew; LXX <i class="calibre6">four hundred and fortieth</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Ziv</i> was the second month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar, usually occurring within the months of April and May; also in verse 37.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> The house was approximately 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high (27.4 meters long, 9.1 meters wide, and 13.7 meters high).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">20 cubits</i> is approximately 30 feet or 9.1 meters; also in verses 16 and 20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">10 cubits</i> is approximately 15 feet or 4.6 meters; also in verses 23–26.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">5 cubits</i> is approximately 7.5 feet or 2.3 meters; also in verses 10 and 24.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">6 cubits</i> is approximately 9 feet or 2.7 meters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">7 cubits</i> is approximately 10.5 feet or 3.2 meters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> LXX and Targum; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">middle</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Or <i class="calibre6">pine</i> or <i class="calibre6">juniper</i> or <i class="calibre6">fir</i>; also in verse 34<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Holy of Holies</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> <i class="calibre6">40 cubits</i> is approximately 60 feet or 18.3 meters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">m</span> Or <i class="calibre6">with cedar</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">n</span> Or <i class="calibre6">made gold chains to draw (the curtains)</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">38</span> <span class="footnotesbot">o</span> <i class="calibre6">Bul</i> was the eighth month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar, usually occurring within the months of October and November.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
