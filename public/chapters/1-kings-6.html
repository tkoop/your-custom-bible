<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the four hundred and eightieth year
after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt, in the month
of Ziv, the second month of the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over
Israel, he began to build the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The house that King Solomon built for the
LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits
high. The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple was
twenty cubits long, extending across the width of the temple and
projecting out ten cubits in front of the temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He also had narrow windows framed high in
the temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Against the walls of the temple and the
inner sanctuary, Solomon built a chambered structure around the
temple, in which he constructed the side rooms. The bottom floor was
five cubits wide, the middle floor six cubits, and the third floor
seven cubits. He also placed offset ledges around the outside of the
temple, so that nothing would be inserted into its walls. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The temple was constructed using finished
stones cut at the quarry, so that no hammer or chisel or any other
iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The entrance to the bottom floor was on
the south side of the temple. A stairway led up to the middle level,
and from there to the third floor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Solomon built the temple and finished
it, roofing it with beams and planks of cedar. He built chambers all
along the temple, each five cubits high and attached to the temple
with beams of cedar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon,
saying: “As for this temple you are building, if you walk in My
statutes, carry out My ordinances, and keep all My commandments by
walking in them, I will fulfill through you the promise I made to
your father David. And I will dwell among the Israelites and will not
abandon My people Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Solomon built the temple and finished
it. He lined the interior walls with cedar paneling from the floor of
the temple to the ceiling, and he covered the floor with cypress
boards. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He partitioned off the twenty cubits at
the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to
form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place. And
the main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The cedar paneling inside the temple was
carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; not a
stone could be seen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon also prepared the inner sanctuary
within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there.
The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and
twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he
also overlaid the altar of cedar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Solomon overlaid the inside of the
temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front
of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold. So he overlaid
with gold the whole interior of the temple, until everything was
completely finished. He also overlaid with gold the entire altar that
belonged to the inner sanctuary. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the inner sanctuary he made two
cherubim, each ten cubits high, out of olive wood. One wing of the
first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing was five cubits
long as well. So the full wingspan was ten cubits. The second cherub
also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same size and shape,
and the height of each cherub was ten cubits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And he placed the cherubim inside the
innermost room of the temple. Since their wings were spread out, the
wing of the first cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the
second cherub touched the other wall, and in the middle of the room
their wingtips touched. He also overlaid the cherubim with gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then he carved the walls all around the
temple, in both the inner and outer sanctuaries, with carved
engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. And he overlaid
the temple floor with gold in both the inner and outer sanctuaries. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the entrance to the inner sanctuary,
Solomon constructed doors of olive wood with five-sided doorposts.
The double doors were made of olive wood, and he carved into them
cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers and overlaid the cherubim and
palm trees with hammered gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the same way he made four-sided
doorposts of olive wood for the sanctuary entrance. The two doors
were made of cypress wood, and each had two folding panels. He carved
into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; and he overlaid
them with gold, hammered evenly over the carvings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon built the inner courtyard with
three rows of dressed stone and one row of trimmed cedar beams. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The foundation of the house of the LORD
was laid in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, in the month of
Ziv. In his eleventh year and eighth month, the month of Bul, the
temple was finished in every detail and according to every
specification. So he built the temple in seven years. </font>
