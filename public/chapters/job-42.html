<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Job Submits Himself to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span></p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Job replied to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“I know that You can do all things </p><p class="indent"> and that no plan of Yours can be thwarted.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>You asked, ‘Who is this </p><p class="indent"> who conceals My counsel without knowledge?’<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, </p><p class="indent"> things too wonderful for me to know.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak. </p><p class="indent"> I will question you, and you shall inform Me.’<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>My ears had heard of You, </p><p class="indent"> but now my eyes have seen You.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore I retract my words, </p><p class="indent"> and I repent in dust and ashes.”
</p><p class="hdg"><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> Rebukes Job’s Friends</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>After <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had spoken these words to Job, He said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you and your two friends. For you have not spoken about Me accurately, as My servant Job has.
<span class="reftext">8</span>So now, take seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. Then My servant Job will pray for you, for I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken accurately about Me, as My servant Job has.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had told them; and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> accepted Job’s request.
</p><p class="hdg"><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> Blesses Job</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>After Job had prayed for his friends, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> restored his prosperity and doubled his former possessions.
<span class="reftext">11</span>All his brothers and sisters and prior acquaintances came and dined with him in his house. They consoled him and comforted him over all the adversity that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had brought upon him. And each one gave him a piece of silver<span class="fn">c</span>  and a gold ring.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> blessed Job’s latter days more than his first. He owned 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys.
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he also had seven sons and three daughters.
<span class="reftext">14</span>He named his first daughter Jemimah, his second Keziah, and his third Keren-happuch.
<span class="reftext">15</span>No women as beautiful as Job’s daughters could be found in all the land, and their father granted them an inheritance among their brothers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>After this, Job lived 140 years and saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And so Job died, old and full of years.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Job 38:2<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Job 38:3 and Job 40:7<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">a kesitah</i>; the value or weight of the kesitah is no longer known.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
