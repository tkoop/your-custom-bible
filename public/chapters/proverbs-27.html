<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Do Not Boast about Tomorrow<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(James 4:13–17)</span></p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>Do not boast about tomorrow, </p><p class="indent"> for you do not know what a day may bring.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>Let another praise you, and not your own mouth—</p><p class="indent"> a stranger, and not your own lips.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>A stone is heavy and sand is a burden, </p><p class="indent"> but aggravation from a fool outweighs them both.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Wrath is cruel and anger is like a flood, </p><p class="indent"> but who can withstand jealousy?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Better an open rebuke </p><p class="indent"> than love that is concealed.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>The wounds of a friend are faithful, </p><p class="indent"> but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>The soul that is full loathes honey, </p><p class="indent"> but to a hungry soul, any bitter thing is sweet.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Like a bird that strays from its nest </p><p class="indent"> is a man who wanders from his home.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Oil and incense bring joy to the heart, </p><p class="indent"> and the sweetness of a friend is counsel to the soul.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend, </p><p class="indent"> and do not go to your brother’s house </p><p class="indent"> in the day of your calamity; </p><p class="indent1"> better a neighbour nearby </p><p class="indent"> than a brother far away.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, </p><p class="indent"> so that I can answer him who taunts me.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>The prudent see danger and take cover; </p><p class="indent"> but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Take the garment of him who posts security for a stranger; </p><p class="indent"> get collateral if it is for a foreigner.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>If one blesses his neighbour with a loud voice early in the morning, </p><p class="indent"> it will be counted to him as a curse.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>A constant dripping on a rainy day </p><p class="indent"> and a contentious woman are alike—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>restraining her is like holding back the wind </p><p class="indent"> or grasping oil with one’s right hand.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>As iron sharpens iron, </p><p class="indent"> so one man sharpens another.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, </p><p class="indent"> and he who looks after his master will be honoured.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>As water reflects the face, </p><p class="indent"> so the heart reflects the true man.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Sheol and Abaddon<span class="fn">c</span>  are never satisfied; </p><p class="indent"> so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold, </p><p class="indent"> but a man is tested by the praise accorded him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>Though you grind a fool like grain with mortar and a pestle, </p><p class="indent"> yet his folly will not depart from him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>Be sure to know the state of your flocks, </p><p class="indent"> and pay close attention to your herds;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>for riches are not forever, </p><p class="indent"> nor does a crown endure to every generation.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>When hay is removed and new growth appears </p><p class="indent"> and the grain from the hills is gathered,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>the lambs will provide you with clothing, </p><p class="indent"> and the goats with the price of a field.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed you—</p><p class="indent"> food for your household </p><p class="indent"> and nourishment for your maidservants.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a wayward woman</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">sharpens the face of another</i> or <i class="calibre6">sharpens the countenance of a friend</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Death and Destruction</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
