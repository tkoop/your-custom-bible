<font ><b>The Creation</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the beginning God created the heavens
and the earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the earth was formless and void, and
darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was
hovering over the surface of the waters. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And God said, “Let there be light,”
and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and He
separated the light from the darkness. God called the light “day,”
and the darkness He called “night.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And there was evening, and there was
morning—the first day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And God said, “Let there be an expanse
between the waters, to separate the waters from the waters.” So God
made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters
above. And it was so. God called the expanse “sky.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And there was evening, and there was
morning—the second day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And God said, “Let the waters under the
sky be gathered into one place, so that the dry land may appear.”
And it was so. God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering
of waters He called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then God said, “Let the earth bring
forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each bearing
fruit with seed according to its kind.” And it was so. The earth
produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and
trees bearing fruit with seed according to their kinds. And God saw
that it was good. </font>

<font >And God said, “Let there be lights in
the expanse of the sky to distinguish between the day and the night,
and let them be signs to mark the seasons and days and years. And let
them serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the
earth.” And it was so. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >God made two great lights: the greater
light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. And He
made the stars as well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >God set these lights in the expanse of the
sky to shine upon the earth, to preside over the day and the night,

good. </font>

<font >And God said, “Let the waters teem with
living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open
expanse of the sky.” So God created the great sea creatures and
every living thing that moves, with which the waters teemed according
to their kinds, and every bird of flight after its kind. And God saw
that it was good. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then God blessed them and said, “Be
fruitful and multiply and fill the waters of the seas, and let birds
multiply on the earth.” </font>

<font >And God said, “Let the earth bring forth
living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, land crawlers,
and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.
God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, the
livestock according to their kinds, and everything that crawls upon
the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">

image, after Our likeness, to rule over the fish of the sea and the
birds of the air, over the livestock, and over all the earth itself

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >So God created man in His own image; </font>

crawls upon the earth—everything that has the breath of life in
it—I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. </font>
