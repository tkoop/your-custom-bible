<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the beginning God created the heavens
and the earth. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the earth was formless and void, and
darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was
hovering over the surface of the waters. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And God said, “Let there be light,”
and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and He
separated the light from the darkness. God called the light “day,”
and the darkness He called “night.” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And God said, “Let there be an expanse
between the waters, to separate the waters from the waters.” So God
made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters
above. And it was so. God called the expanse “sky.” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And God said, “Let the waters under the
sky be gathered into one place, so that the dry land may appear.”

trees bearing fruit with seed according to their kinds. And God saw
that it was good. </font>

that it was good. </font>
