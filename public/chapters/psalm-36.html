A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD. </p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>An oracle is in my heart </p><p class="indent"> regarding the transgression of the wicked man: </p><p class="indent1"> There is no fear of God </p><p class="indent"> before his eyes.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>For his eyes are too full of conceit </p><p class="indent"> to detect or hate his own sin.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; </p><p class="indent"> he has ceased to be wise and well-doing.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Even on his bed he plots wickedness; </p><p class="indent"> he sets himself on a path that is not good; </p><p class="indent"> he fails to reject evil.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Your loving devotion, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, </p><p class="indent"> Your faithfulness to the clouds.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Your righteousness is like the highest mountains; </p><p class="indent"> Your judgments are like the deepest sea. </p><p class="indent"> O LORD, You preserve man and beast.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>How precious is Your loving devotion, O God, </p><p class="indent"> that the children of men take refuge </p><p class="indent"> in the shadow of Your wings!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>They feast on the abundance of Your house, </p><p class="indent"> and You give them drink from Your river of delights.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>For with You is the fountain of life; </p><p class="indent"> in Your light we see light.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Extend Your loving devotion to those who know You, </p><p class="indent"> and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Let not the foot of the proud come against me, </p><p class="indent"> nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>There the evildoers lie fallen, </p><p class="indent"> thrown down and unable to rise.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in Romans 3:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
