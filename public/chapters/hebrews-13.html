<font >Continue in brotherly love. Do not neglect
to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have
entertained angels without knowing it. Remember those in prison as if
you were bound with them, and those who are mistreated as if you were
suffering with them. </font>

<font >Marriage should be honored by all and the
marriage bed kept undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral

<font >Although the high priest brings the blood
of animals into the Holy Place as a sacrifice for sin, the bodies are
burned outside the camp. And so Jesus also suffered outside the city
gate, to sanctify the people by His own blood. Therefore let us go to
Him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace He bore. For here we do
not have a permanent city, but we are looking for the city that is to
come. </font>
