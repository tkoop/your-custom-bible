<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Jacob’s Departure</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him.
“Do not take a wife from the Canaanite women,” he commanded. “Go
at once to Paddan-aram, to the house of your mother’s father
Bethuel, and take a wife from among the daughters of Laban, your
mother’s brother. May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful
and multiply you, so that you may become a company of peoples. And
may He give the blessing of Abraham to you and your descendants, so
that you may possess the land where you dwell as a foreigner, the
land God gave to Abraham.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-aram, to
Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the
mother of Jacob and Esau. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed
Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to take a wife there, commanding
him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,” and that Jacob had obeyed
his father and mother and gone to Paddan-aram. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And seeing that his father Isaac
disapproved of the Canaanite women, Esau went to Ishmael and married
Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Abraham’s son
Ishmael, in addition to the wives he already had. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile Jacob left Beersheba and set out
for Haran. On reaching a certain place, he spent the night there
because the sun had set. And taking one of the stones from that
place, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Jacob had a dream about a ladder that
rested on the earth with its top reaching up to heaven, and God’s
angels were going up and down the ladder. And there at the top the
LORD was standing and saying, “I am the LORD, the God of your
father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your
descendants the land on which you now lie. Your descendants will be
like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and
east and north and south. All the families of the earth will be
blessed through you and your offspring. Look, I am with you, and I
will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to
this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have
promised you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jacob woke up, he thought, “Surely
the LORD is in this place, and I was unaware of it.” And he was
afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other
than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Early the next morning, Jacob took the
stone that he had placed under his head, and he set it up as a
pillar. He poured oil on top of it, and he called that place Bethel,
though previously the city had been named Luz. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God
will be with me and watch over me on this journey, and if He will
provide me with food to eat and clothes to wear, so that I may return
safely to my father’s house, then the LORD will be my God. And this
stone I have set up as a pillar will be God’s house, and of all
that You give me I will surely give You a tenth.” </font>
