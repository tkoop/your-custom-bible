</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Good Samaritan</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>One day an expert in the law stood up to test <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>He answered, “<span class="thinq"> </span>‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’<span class="fn">c</span>  and ‘Love your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> as yourself.’<span class="fn">d</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">28</span>“You have answered correctly,”</span> Jesus said. <span>“Do this and you will live.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, “And who is my <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Jesus took up this question and said, <span>“A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>Now by chance a priest was going down the same road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">32</span>So too, when a Levite came to that spot and saw him, he passed by on the other side.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">33</span>But when a Samaritan on a journey came upon him, he looked at him and had compassion.
<span class="reftext">34</span>He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">35</span>The next day he took out two denarii<span class="fn">e</span>  and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Take care of him,’ he said, ‘and on my return I will repay you for any additional expense.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">36</span>Which of these three do you think was a <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>“The one who showed him mercy,” replied the expert in the law. </p><p class="reg1"> Then Jesus told him, <span>“Go and do likewise.”</span>

<span class="reftext">39</span>She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> message.
<span class="reftext">40</span>But Martha was distracted by all the preparations to be made. She came to Jesus and said, “Lord, do <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her to help me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">41</span>“Martha, Martha,”</span> the Lord replied, <span>“you are worried and upset about many things.
