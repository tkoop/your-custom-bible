<font >After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two
others and sent them two by two ahead of Him to every town and place
He was about to visit. And He told them, <font color="#a80000">“The
harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the
harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Go! I am sending you
out like lambs among wolves. Carry no purse or bag or sandals. Do not
greet anyone along the road. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Whatever house you
enter, begin by saying, ‘Peace to this house.’ If a man of peace
is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you.
Stay at the same house, eating and drinking whatever you are offered.
For the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move around from house
to house. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >If you enter a town
and they welcome you, eat whatever is set before you. Heal the sick
who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you.’ </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But if you enter a
town and they do not welcome you, go into the streets and declare,
‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off as
a testimony against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is
near.’ I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom
than for that town. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Woe to you,
Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were
performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would
have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. But it will
be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. </font></font>

<font >The seventy-two returned with joy and
said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in Your name.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So He told them, <font color="#a80000">“I
saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold, I have given you
authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of
the enemy. Nothing will harm you. Nevertheless, do not rejoice that
the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in
heaven.”</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >At that time Jesus rejoiced in the Holy
Spirit and declared, <font color="#a80000">“I praise You, Father,
Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from
the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes,
Father, for this was well-pleasing in Your sight.</font> </font>

<font >Then Jesus turned to the disciples and
said privately, <font color="#a80000">“Blessed are the eyes that
see what you see. For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired
to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but
did not hear it.”</font> </font>

<font >One day an expert in the law stood up to

<font >He answered, “<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>‘Love

<font >But wanting to justify himself, he asked
Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Jesus took up this question and said, <font color="#a80000">“A
man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the
hands of robbers. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving
him half dead.</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >But when a Samaritan
on a journey came upon him, he looked at him and had compassion. He
went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he
put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of
him. </font></font>

<font >As they traveled along, Jesus entered a
village where a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home. She
had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to
His message. But Martha was distracted by all the preparations to be

sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her to help me!” </font>
