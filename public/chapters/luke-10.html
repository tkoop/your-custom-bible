<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jesus Sends the Seventy-Two<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 9:35–38)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two<span class="fn">a</span>  others and sent them two by two ahead of Him to every town and place He was about to visit.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And He told them, <span>“The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">3</span>Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Carry no purse or bag or sandals. Do not greet anyone along the road.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">5</span>Whatever house you enter, begin by saying, ‘Peace to this house.’
<span class="reftext">6</span>If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Stay at the same house, eating and drinking whatever you are offered. For the worker is worthy of his wages.<span class="fn">b</span>  Do not move around from house to house.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">8</span>If you enter a town and they welcome you, eat whatever is set before you.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Heal the sick who are there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">10</span>But if you enter a town and they do not welcome you, go into the streets and declare,
<span class="reftext">11</span>‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off as a testimony against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.’
<span class="reftext">12</span>I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.
</p><p class="hdg">Woe to the Unrepentant<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 11:20–24)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">13</span>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">15</span>And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades!
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">16</span>Whoever listens to you listens to Me; whoever rejects you rejects Me; and whoever rejects Me rejects the One who sent Me.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Joyful Return</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in Your name.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>So He told them, <span>“I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Behold, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing will harm you.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus’ Prayer of Thanksgiving<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 11:25–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>At that time Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and declared, <span>“I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing in Your sight.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">22</span>All things have been entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then Jesus turned to the disciples and said privately, <span>“Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.
<span class="reftext">24</span>For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Good Samaritan</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>One day an expert in the law stood up to test Him. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">26</span>“What is written in the Law?”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“How do you read it?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>He answered, “<span class="thinq"> </span>‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’<span class="fn">c</span>  and ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’<span class="fn">d</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">28</span>“You have answered correctly,”</span> Jesus said. <span>“Do this and you will live.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>But wanting to justify himself, he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbour?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Jesus took up this question and said, <span>“A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>Now by chance a priest was going down the same road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">32</span>So too, when a Levite came to that spot and saw him, he passed by on the other side.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">33</span>But when a Samaritan on a journey came upon him, he looked at him and had compassion.
<span class="reftext">34</span>He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">35</span>The next day he took out two denarii<span class="fn">e</span>  and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Take care of him,’ he said, ‘and on my return I will repay you for any additional expense.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">36</span>Which of these three do you think was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>“The one who showed him mercy,” replied the expert in the law. </p><p class="reg1"> Then Jesus told him, <span>“Go and do likewise.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Martha and Mary</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>As they travelled along, Jesus entered a village where a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home.
<span class="reftext">39</span>She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to His message.
<span class="reftext">40</span>But Martha was distracted by all the preparations to be made. She came to Jesus and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her to help me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">41</span>“Martha, Martha,”</span> the Lord replied, <span>“you are worried and upset about many things.
<span class="reftext">42</span>But only one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, and it will not be taken away from her.”</span></p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> NE, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">seventy</i>; also in verse 17<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> See Leviticus 19:13 and Deuteronomy 24:14–15; cited in 1 Timothy 5:18.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Deuteronomy 6:5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Leviticus 19:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> A denarius was customarily a day’s wage for a labourer; see Matthew 20:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
