<font ><b>Jotham Reigns in Judah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jotham was twenty-five years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His motherâ€™s
name was Jerushah daughter of Zadok. And he did what was right in the
eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done. In addition, he
did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still behaved
corruptly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house
of the LORD, and he worked extensively on the wall at the hill of
Ophel. He also built cities in the hill country of Judah and
fortresses and towers in the forests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jotham waged war against the king of the
Ammonites and defeated them, and that year they gave him a hundred
talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand cors
of barley. They paid him the same in the second and third years. So
Jotham grew powerful because he ordered his ways before the LORD his
God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Jotham,
along with all his wars and his ways, they are indeed written in the
Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. He was twenty-five years old
when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. And
Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David.
And his son Ahaz reigned in his place. </font>
