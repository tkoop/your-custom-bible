<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Stephen’s Address: The Call of Abraham<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Genesis 12:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Are these charges true?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And Stephen declared: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and told him, ‘Leave your country and your kindred and go to the land I will show you.’<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>So Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, God brought him out of that place and into this land where <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are now living.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>He gave him no inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. But God promised to give possession of the land to Abraham and his descendants, even though he did not yet have a child.
<span class="reftext">6</span>God told him that his descendants would be foreigners in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.
<span class="reftext">7</span>‘But I will punish the nation that enslaves them,’ God said, ‘and afterward they will come forth and worship <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> in this place.’<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, and Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. And Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.
</p><p class="hdg">Joseph Sold into Egypt<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Genesis 37:12–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him
<span class="reftext">10</span>and rescued him from all his troubles. He granted Joseph <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler over Egypt and all his household.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then famine and great suffering swept across Egypt and Canaan, and our fathers could not find food.
<span class="reftext">12</span>When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit.
<span class="reftext">13</span>On their second visit, Joseph revealed his identity to<span class="fn">c</span>  his brothers, and his family became known to Pharaoh.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Then Joseph sent for his father Jacob and all his relatives, seventy-five in all.
</p><p class="hdg">Israel Oppressed in Egypt<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 1:8–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our fathers died.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Their bones were carried back<span class="fn">d</span>  to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a price he paid in silver.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>As the time drew near for God to <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> promise to Abraham, our people in Egypt increased greatly in number.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Then another king, who knew nothing of Joseph, arose over Egypt.
<span class="reftext">19</span>He exploited our people and oppressed our fathers, forcing them to abandon their infants so they would die.
</p><p class="hdg">The Birth and Adoption of Moses<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 2:1–10; Hebrews 11:23–29)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>At that time Moses was born, and he was beautiful in the sight of God.<span class="fn">e</span>  For three months he was nurtured in his father’s house.
<span class="reftext">21</span>When he was set outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and brought him up as her own son.
<span class="reftext">22</span>So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action.
</p><p class="hdg">The Rejection and Flight of Moses<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 2:11–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And when he saw one of them being mistreated, Moses went to his <span class='spell ca'>defence</span><span class='spell gb'>defence</span><span class='spell us'>defense</span> and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian who was oppressing him.
<span class="reftext">25</span>He assumed his brothers would understand that God was using him to deliver them, but they did not.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>The next day he came upon two Israelites who were fighting, and he tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are brothers. Why are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> mistreating each other?’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>But the man who was abusing his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> pushed Moses aside and said, ‘Who made you ruler and judge over us?
<span class="reftext">28</span>Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">29</span>At this remark, Moses fled to the land of Midian, where he lived as a foreigner and had two sons.
</p><p class="hdg">The Call of Moses<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 3:1–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.
<span class="reftext">31</span>When Moses saw it, he <span class='spell ca'>marvelled</span><span class='spell gb'>marvelled</span><span class='spell us'>marveled</span> at the sight. As he approached to look more closely, the voice of the Lord came to him:
<span class="reftext">32</span>‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’<span class="fn">g</span>  Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
<span class="reftext">34</span>I have indeed seen the oppression of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.’<span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>This Moses, whom they had rejected with the words, ‘Who made you ruler and judge?’<span class="fn">i</span>  is the one whom God sent to be their ruler and redeemer through the angel<span class="fn">j</span>  who appeared to him in the bush.
<span class="reftext">36</span>He led them out and performed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, at the Red <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span><span class='bsb'>Sea</span>, and for forty years in the wilderness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>This is the same Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> a prophet like me from among <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers.’<span class="fn">k</span> 
<span class="reftext">38</span>He was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. And he received living words to pass on to us.<span class="fn">l</span>

<span class="reftext">40</span>They said to Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go before us! As for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.’<span class="fn">m</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>At that time they made a calf and offered a sacrifice to the idol, rejoicing in the works of their hands.
<span class="reftext">42</span>But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the host of <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>, as it is written in the book of the prophets: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Did <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> bring <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> sacrifices and offerings </p><p class="indent"> forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

It was constructed exactly as God had directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen.
<span class="reftext">45</span>And our fathers who received it brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations God drove out before them. It remained until the time of David,
<span class="reftext">46</span>who found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in the sight of God and asked to provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.<span class="fn">o</span>

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">57</span>At this they covered their ears, cried out in a loud voice, and rushed together at him.
<span class="reftext">58</span>They dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile the witnesses laid their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">59</span>While they were stoning him, Stephen appealed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”
<span class="reftext">60</span>Falling on his knees, he cried out in a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Genesis 12:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Genesis 15:13–14; Exodus 3:12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Joseph was made known to</i> or <i class="calibre6">Joseph was <span class='spell ca'>recognized</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognized</span> by</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">And they were carried back</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">he was of great status in God’s eyes</i> or <i class="calibre6">he was no ordinary child</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Exodus 2:13–14 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">32</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Exodus 3:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">34</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Exodus 3:5–10<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Exodus 2:14<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i>; also in verse 38<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">37</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Deuteronomy 18:15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">38</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> NE and WH <i class="calibre6">to you</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">40</span> <span class="footnotesbot">m</span> Exodus 32:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">43</span> <span class="footnotesbot">n</span> Amos 5:25–27 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">46</span> <span class="footnotesbot">o</span> SBL, WH, BYZ, and TR; see also LXX for Psalm 132:5; ECM, NA, and NE <i class="calibre6">a dwelling place for the house of Jacob.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">50</span> <span class="footnotesbot">p</span> Isaiah 66:1–2<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">54</span> <span class="footnotesbot">q</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">On hearing these things, they were cut in their hearts,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
