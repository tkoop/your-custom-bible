<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Job: God Will Punish the Wicked</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Job answered:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Listen carefully to my words; </p><p class="indent"> let this be your consolation to me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Bear with me while I speak; </p><p class="indent"> then, after I have spoken, you may go on mocking.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Is my complaint against a man? </p><p class="indent"> Then why should I not be impatient?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Look at me and be appalled; </p><p class="indent"> put your hand over your mouth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>When I remember, terror takes hold, </p><p class="indent"> and my body trembles in horror.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Why do the wicked live on, </p><p class="indent"> growing old and increasing in power?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Their descendants are established around them, </p><p class="indent"> and their offspring before their eyes.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Their homes are safe from fear; </p><p class="indent"> no rod of punishment from God is upon them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Their bulls breed without fail; </p><p class="indent"> their cows bear calves and do not miscarry.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>They send forth their little ones like a flock; </p><p class="indent"> their children skip about,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>singing to the tambourine and lyre </p><p class="indent"> and making merry at the sound of the flute.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>They spend their days in prosperity </p><p class="indent"> and go down to Sheol in peace.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Yet they say to God: ‘Leave us alone! </p><p class="indent"> For we have no desire to know Your ways.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, </p><p class="indent"> and what would we gain if we pray to Him?’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Still, their prosperity is not in their own hands, </p><p class="indent"> so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? </p><p class="indent"> Does disaster come upon them? </p><p class="indent"> Does God, in His anger, apportion destruction?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Are they like straw before the wind, </p><p class="indent"> like chaff swept away by a storm?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>It is said that God lays up one’s punishment for his children. </p><p class="indent"> Let God repay the man himself, so he will know it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Let his eyes see his own destruction; </p><p class="indent"> let him drink for himself the wrath of the Almighty.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>For what does he care about his household after him, </p><p class="indent"> when the number of his months has run out?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>Can anyone teach knowledge to God, </p><p class="indent"> since He judges those on high?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>One man dies full of vigour, </p><p class="indent"> completely secure and at ease.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>His body is well nourished,<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and his bones are rich with marrow.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Yet another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, </p><p class="indent"> having never tasted prosperity.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>But together they lie down in the dust, </p><p class="indent"> and worms cover them both.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>Behold, I know your thoughts full well, </p><p class="indent"> the schemes by which you would wrong me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>For you say, ‘Where now is the nobleman’s house, </p><p class="indent"> and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Have you never asked those who travel the roads? </p><p class="indent"> Do you not accept their reports?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, </p><p class="indent"> delivered from the day of wrath.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Who denounces his behaviour to his face? </p><p class="indent"> Who repays him for what he has done?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>He is carried to the grave, </p><p class="indent"> and watch is kept over his tomb.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>The clods of the valley are sweet to him; </p><p class="indent"> everyone follows behind him, </p><p class="indent"> and those before him are without number.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">34</span>So how can you comfort me with empty words? </p><p class="indent"> For your answers remain full of falsehood.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in an instant</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">His pails are full of milk</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
