11</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>A Blessing and a Curse </b></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You shall therefore love the LORD your God
and always keep His charge, His statutes, His ordinances, and His
commandments. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Know this day that it is not your children
who have known and seen the discipline of the LORD your God: His
greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm; the signs and
works He did in Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and all his land; what
He did to the Egyptian army and horses and chariots when He made the
waters of the Red Sea engulf them as they pursued you, and how He
destroyed them completely, even to this day; what He did for you in
the wilderness until you reached this place; and what He did in the
midst of all the Israelites to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab
the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them,
their households, their tents, and every living thing that belonged
to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For it is your own eyes that have seen
every great work that the LORD has done. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You shall therefore keep every commandment
I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and
possess the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, and so
that you may live long in the land that the LORD swore to your
fathers to give them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk
and honey. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the land that you are entering to
possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come,
where you sowed your seed and irrigated on foot, like a vegetable
garden. But the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess is a
land of mountains and valleys that drinks in the rain from heaven. It
is a land for which the LORD your God cares; the eyes of the LORD
your God are always on it, from the beginning to the end of the year.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So if you carefully obey the commandments
I am giving you today, to love the LORD your God and to serve Him
with all your heart and with all your soul, then I will provide rain
for your land in season, the autumn and spring rains, that you may
gather your grain, new wine, and oil. And I will provide grass in the
fields for your livestock, and you will eat and be satisfied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But be careful that you are not enticed to
turn aside to worship and bow down to other gods, or the anger of the
LORD will be kindled against you. He will shut the heavens so that
there will be no rain, nor will the land yield its produce, and you
will soon perish from the good land that the LORD is giving you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Fix these words of mine in your hearts and
minds; tie them as reminders on your hands and bind them on your
foreheads. Teach them to your children, speaking about them when you
sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and
when you get up. Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on
your gates, so that as long as the heavens are above the earth, your
days and those of your children may be multiplied in the land that
the LORD swore to give your fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For if you carefully keep all these
commandments I am giving you to follow—to love the LORD your God,
to walk in all His ways, and to hold fast to Him— then the LORD
will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess
nations greater and stronger than you. Every place where the sole of
your foot treads will be yours. Your territory will extend from the
wilderness to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Western
Sea. No man will be able to stand against you; the LORD your God will
put the fear and dread of you upon all the land, wherever you set
foot, as He has promised you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">See, today I am setting before you a
blessing and a curse— a blessing if you obey the commandments of
the LORD your God that I am giving you today, but a curse if you
disobey the commandments of the LORD your God and turn aside from the
path I command you today by following other gods, which you have not
known. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the LORD your God brings you into the
land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim the blessing on
Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. Are not these mountains
across the Jordan, west of the road toward the sunset, in the land of
the Canaanites who live in the Arabah opposite Gilgal near the Oak of
Moreh? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For you are about to cross the Jordan to
enter and possess the land that the LORD your God is giving you. When
you take possession of it and settle in it, be careful to follow all
the statutes and ordinances that I am setting before you today. </font>
