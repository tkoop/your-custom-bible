</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Know this day that it is not your children who have known and seen the discipline of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God: His greatness, <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mighty hand, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> outstretched arm;
<span class="reftext">3</span>the signs and works <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> did in Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and all his land;
<span class="reftext">4</span>what <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> did to the Egyptian army and horses and chariots when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> made the waters of the Red <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span><span class="fn">a</span>  engulf them as they pursued you, and how <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> destroyed them completely, even to this day;
<span class="reftext">5</span>what <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> did for you in the wilderness until you reached this place;
<span class="reftext">6</span>and what <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> did in the midst of all the Israelites to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that belonged to them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>For it is your own eyes that have seen every great work that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has done.
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Great Blessings<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Joshua 1:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>You shall therefore keep every commandment I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and possess the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess,
<span class="reftext">9</span>and so that you may live long in the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> swore to your fathers to give them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>For the land that you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and irrigated on foot, like a vegetable garden.
<span class="reftext">11</span>But the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks in the rain from heaven.
<span class="reftext">12</span>It is a land for which <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God cares; the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God are always on it, from the beginning to the end of the year.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So if you carefully obey the commandments I am giving you today, to love <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God and to serve <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> with all your heart and with all your soul,
<span class="reftext">14</span>then I will provide<span class="fn">b</span>  rain for your land in season, the autumn and spring rains, that you may gather your grain, new wine, and oil.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And I will provide grass in the fields for your livestock, and you will eat and be satisfied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But be careful that you are not enticed to turn aside to worship and bow down to other gods,
<span class="reftext">17</span>or the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will be kindled against you. He will shut the heavens so that there will be no rain, nor will the land yield its produce, and you will soon perish from the good land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is giving you.
</p><p class="hdg">Remember God’s Words</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as reminders on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Teach them to your children, speaking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates,
<span class="reftext">21</span>so that as long as the heavens are above the earth, your days and those of your children may be multiplied in the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> swore to give your fathers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>For if you carefully keep all these commandments I am giving you to follow—to love <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, to walk in all <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> ways, and to hold fast to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>—
<span class="reftext">23</span>then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and stronger than you.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Every place where the sole of your foot treads will be yours. Your territory will extend from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Western <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span>.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">25</span>No man will be able to stand against you; <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will put the fear and dread of you upon all the land, wherever you set foot, as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has promised you.
</p><p class="hdg">A Blessing and a Curse </p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>See, today I am setting before you a blessing and a curse—
<span class="reftext">27</span>a blessing if you obey the commandments of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God that I am giving you today,
<span class="reftext">28</span>but a curse if you disobey the commandments of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God and turn aside from the path I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>When <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Are not these mountains across the Jordan, west of the road toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah opposite Gilgal near the <span class='cap'>Oak</span><span class='nocap'>oak</span><span class="fn">d</span>  of Moreh?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>For you are about to cross the Jordan to enter and possess the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is giving you. When you take possession of it and settle in it,
<span class="reftext">32</span>be careful to follow all the statutes and ordinances that I am setting before you today.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Sea of Reeds</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew; SP, LXX, and Vulgate <i class="calibre6">He will provide</i>; also in verse 15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, the Mediterranean Sea, also called the Great Sea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> SP, LXX, and Syriac (see Genesis 12:6); Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Oaks</i> or <i class="calibre6">Terebinths</i> or <i class="calibre6">Great Trees</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
