<font >At that time the disciples came to Jesus
and asked, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus invited a little child to stand
among them. <font color="#a80000">“Truly I tell you,”</font> He
said, <font color="#a80000">“unless you change and become like
little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this little child is the
greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes a little
child like this in My name welcomes Me.</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >But if anyone causes
one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be
better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to
be drowned in the depths of the sea. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Woe to the world for
the causes of sin. These stumbling blocks must come, but woe to the
man through whom they come! </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >If your hand or your
foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better
for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands and two
feet and be thrown into the eternal fire. And if your eye causes you
to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter
life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire
of hell. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >See that you do not
look down on any of these little ones. For I tell you that their
angels in heaven always see the face of My Father in heaven. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >What do you think?
If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not
leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go out to search for the one
that is lost? And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices more
over that one sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
In the same way, your Father in heaven is not willing that any of
these little ones should perish. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >If your brother sins
against you, go and confront him privately. If he listens to you, you
have won your brother over. But if he will not listen, take one or
two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the
testimony of two or three witnesses.’ If he refuses to listen to
them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the
church, regard him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Truly I tell you,
whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you
loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Again, I tell you
truly that if two of you on the earth agree about anything you ask
for, it will be done for you by My Father in heaven. For where two or
three gather together in My name, there am I with them.” </font></font>

<font >Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord,
how many times shall I forgive my brother who sins against me? Up to
seven times?” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">

<font color="#a80000"><font >Because of this, the
kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with
his servants. As he began the settlements, a debtor was brought to
him owing ten thousand talents. Since the man was unable to pay, the
master ordered that he be sold to pay his debt, along with his wife
and children and everything he owned. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Then the servant
fell on his knees before him. ‘Have patience with me,’ he begged,

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >His master had
compassion on him, forgave his debt, and released him. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >But when that
servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a
hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay
back what you owe me!’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >So his fellow
servant fell down and begged him, ‘Have patience with me, and I

<font color="#a80000"><font >But he refused.
Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison until he could
pay his debt. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >When his fellow
servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and
they went and recounted all of this to their master. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Then the master
summoned him and declared, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave all your
debt because you begged me. Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your
fellow servant, just as I had on you?’ In anger his master turned
him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should repay all
that he owed. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >That is how My
heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your
brother from your heart.” </font></font>
