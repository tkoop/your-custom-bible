<span class="reftext">13</span>And if he finds it, truly I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, he rejoices more over that one sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.

<span class="reftext">24</span>As he began the settlements, a debtor was brought to him owing ten thousand talents.<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Since the man was unable to pay, the master ordered that he be sold to pay his debt, along with his wife and children and everything he owned.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then the servant fell on his knees before him. ‘Have patience with me,’ he begged, ‘and I will pay back everything.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">27</span>His master had compassion on him, forgave his debt, and released him.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii.<span class="fn">g</span>  He grabbed him and began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back what you owe me!’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">29</span>So his fellow servant fell down and begged him, ‘Have patience with me, and I will pay you back.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">30</span>But he refused. Instead, he went and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay his debt.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed, and they went and recounted all of this to their master.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">32</span>Then the master summoned him and declared, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave all your debt because you begged me.
<span class="reftext">33</span>Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had on you?’
<span class="reftext">34</span>In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should repay all that he owed.
