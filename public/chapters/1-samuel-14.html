<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Jonathan’s Victory over the
Philistines</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the
young man bearing his armor, “Come, let us cross over to the
Philistine outpost on the other side.” But Jonathan did not tell
his father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile, Saul was staying under the
pomegranate tree in Migron on the outskirts of Gibeah. And the troops
who were with him numbered about six hundred men, including Ahijah,
who was wearing an ephod. He was the son of Ichabod’s brother
Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of the LORD in
Shiloh. But the troops did not know that Jonathan had left. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now there were cliffs on both sides of the
pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost.
One was named Bozez and the other Seneh. One cliff stood to the north
toward Michmash, and the other to the south toward Geba. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jonathan said to the young man bearing his
armor, “Come, let us cross over to the outpost of these
uncircumcised men. Perhaps the LORD will work on our behalf. Nothing
can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">His armor-bearer replied, “Do all that
is in your heart. Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Very well,” said Jonathan, “we will
cross over toward these men and show ourselves to them. If they say,
‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stay where we are and
will not go up to them. But if they say, ‘Come on up,’ then we
will go up, because this will be our sign that the LORD has delivered
them into our hands.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the two of them showed themselves to
the outpost of the Philistines, who exclaimed, “Look, the Hebrews
are coming out of the holes in which they were hiding!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the men of the outpost called out to
Jonathan and his armor-bearer, “Come on up, and we will teach you a
lesson!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Follow me,” Jonathan told his
armor-bearer, “for the LORD has delivered them into the hand of
Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jonathan climbed up on his hands and
feet, with his armor-bearer behind him. And the Philistines fell
before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and finished them off.
In that first assault, Jonathan and his armor-bearer struck down
about twenty men over half an acre of land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then terror struck the Philistines in the
camp, in the field, and among all the people. Even those in the
outposts and raiding parties trembled. Indeed, the earth quaked and
panic spread from God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when Saul’s watchmen at Gibeah in
Benjamin looked and saw the troops melting away and scattering in
every direction, Saul said to the troops who were with him, “Call
the roll and see who has left us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when they had called the roll, they
saw that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark
of God.” (For at that time it was with the Israelites.) While Saul
was talking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp
continued to increase. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your
hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Saul and all his troops assembled and
marched to the battle, and they found the Philistines in total
confusion, with each man wielding the sword against his neighbor. And
the Hebrews who had previously gone up into the surrounding camps of
the Philistines now went over to the Israelites who were with Saul
and Jonathan. When all the Israelites who had been hiding in the hill
country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they also
joined Saul and Jonathan in the battle. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the
battle moved on beyond Beth-aven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the men of Israel were in distress
that day, for Saul had placed the troops under an oath, saying,
“Cursed is the man who eats any food before evening, before I have
taken vengeance on my enemies.” So none of the troops tasted any
food. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all the troops entered the forest,
and there was honey on the ground. And when they entered the forest
and saw the flowing honey, not one of them put his hand to his mouth,
because they feared the oath. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jonathan, however, had not heard that his
father had charged the people with the oath. So he reached out the
end of the staff in his hand, dipped it into the honeycomb, and put
his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened. Then one of the
soldiers told him, “Your father bound the troops with a solemn
oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’ That is
why the people are faint.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">My father has brought trouble to the
land,” Jonathan replied. “Just look at how my eyes have
brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. How much better
it would have been if the troops had eaten freely today from the
plunder they took from their enemies! Would not the slaughter of the
Philistines have been much greater?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">That day, after the Israelites had struck
down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, the people were very
faint. So they rushed greedily to the plunder, taking sheep, cattle,
and calves. They slaughtered them on the ground and ate meat with the
blood still in it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then someone reported to Saul: “Look,
the troops are sinning against the LORD by eating meat with the blood
still in it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You have broken faith,” said Saul.
“Roll a large stone over here at once.” Then he said, “Go among
the troops and tell them, ‘Each man must bring me his ox or his
sheep, slaughter them in this place, and then eat. Do not sin against
the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So that night everyone brought his ox and
slaughtered it there. Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was
the first time he had built an altar to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Saul said, “Let us go down after the
Philistines by night and plunder them until dawn, leaving no man
alive!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do what seems good to you,” the
troops replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the priest said, “We must consult
God here.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go
down after the Philistines? Will You give them into the hand of
Israel?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But God did not answer him that day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore Saul said, “Come here, all you
leaders of the troops, and let us investigate how this sin has
occurred today. As surely as the LORD who saves Israel lives, even if
it is my son Jonathan, he must die!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But not one of the troops said a word. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Saul said to all Israel, “You stand
on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do what seems good to you,” the
troops replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Saul said to the LORD, the God of
Israel, “Why have You not answered Your servant this day? If the
fault is with me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim; but if the
fault is with the men of Israel, respond with Thummim.” And
Jonathan and Saul were selected, but the people were cleared of the
charge. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me
and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was selected. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Tell me what you have done,” Saul
commanded him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jonathan told him, “I only tasted a
little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. And now I
must die?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Saul declared, “May God punish me,
and ever so severely, if you, Jonathan, do not surely die!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the people said to Saul, “Must
Jonathan die—he who accomplished such a great deliverance for
Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head
will fall to the ground, for with God’s help he has accomplished
this today.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did
not die. Then Saul gave up his pursuit of the Philistines, and the
Philistines returned to their own land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After Saul had assumed the kingship over
Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side—the
Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, the kings of Zobah, and the
Philistines. Wherever he turned, he routed them. He fought valiantly
and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of its
plunderers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi,
and Malchishua. His two daughters were named Merab (his firstborn)
and Michal (his younger daughter). His wife’s name was Ahinoam
daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner,
the son of Saul’s uncle Ner. Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s
father Ner were sons of Abiel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the war with the Philistines was
fierce for all the days of Saul. So whenever he noticed any strong or
brave man, Saul would enlist him. </font>
