<font ><b>The Valley of Dry Bones</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The hand of the LORD was upon me, and He
brought me out by His Spirit and set me down in the middle of the
valley, and it was full of bones. He led me all around among them,
and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, and indeed,
they were very dry. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He asked me, “Son of man, can these
bones come to life?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >O Lord GOD,” I replied, “only You
know.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And He said to me, “Prophesy concerning
these bones and tell them, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD!
This is what the Lord GOD says to these bones: I will cause breath to
enter you, and you will come to life. I will attach tendons to you
and make flesh grow upon you and cover you with skin. I will put
breath within you so that you will come to life. Then you will know
that I am the LORD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I prophesied as I had been commanded.
And as I prophesied, there was suddenly a noise, a rattling, and the
bones came together, bone to bone. As I looked on, tendons appeared
on them, flesh grew, and skin covered them; but there was no breath
in them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the
breath; prophesy, son of man, and tell the breath that this is what
the Lord GOD says: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe
into these slain, so that they may live!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I prophesied as He had commanded me,
and the breath entered them, and they came to life and stood on their
feet—a vast army. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He said to me, “Son of man, these
bones are the whole house of Israel. Look, they are saying, ‘Our
bones are dried up, and our hope has perished; we are cut off.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore prophesy and tell them that this
is what the Lord GOD says: ‘O My people, I will open your graves
and bring you up from them, and I will bring you back to the land of
Israel. Then you, My people, will know that I am the LORD, when I
open your graves and bring you up from them. I will put My Spirit in
you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then
you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will do it,
declares the LORD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “And you, son of man, take a single stick and write on it:
‘Belonging to Judah and to the Israelites associated with him.’
Then take another stick and write on it: ‘Belonging to Joseph—the
stick of Ephraim—and to all the house of Israel associated with
him.’ Then join them together into one stick, so that they become
one in your hand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When your people ask you, ‘Won’t you
explain to us what you mean by these?’ you are to tell them that
this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will take the stick of Joseph,
which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel associated
with him, and I will put them together with the stick of Judah. I
will make them into a single stick, and they will become one in My
hand.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the sticks on which you write are in
your hand and in full view of the people, you are to tell them that
this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will take the Israelites out of
the nations to which they have gone, and I will gather them from all
around and bring them into their own land. I will make them one
nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and one king will
rule over all of them. Then they will no longer be two nations and
will never again be divided into two kingdoms. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They will no longer defile themselves with
their idols or detestable images, or with any of their
transgressions. I will save them from all their apostasies by which
they sinned, and I will cleanse them. Then they will be My people,
and I will be their God. My servant David will be king over them, and
there will be one shepherd for all of them. They will follow My
ordinances and keep and observe My statutes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They will live in the land that I gave to
My servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They will live there
forever with their children and grandchildren, and My servant David
will be their prince forever. And I will make a covenant of peace
with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish them
and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary among them forever. My
dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will
be My people. Then the nations will know that I the LORD sanctify
Israel, when My sanctuary is among them forever.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
