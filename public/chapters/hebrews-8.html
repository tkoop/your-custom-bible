<font >The point of what we are saying is this:
We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the
throne of the Majesty in heaven, and who ministers in the sanctuary
and true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man. And since every
high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, it was
necessary for this One also to have something to offer. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if He were on earth, He would not be a
priest, since there are already priests who offer gifts according to
the law. The place where they serve is a copy and shadow of what is
in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build
the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to
the pattern shown you on the mountain.” </font>

<font >Now, however, Jesus has received a much
more excellent ministry, just as the covenant He mediates is better
and is founded on better promises. For if that first covenant had
been without fault, no place would have been sought for a second. But
God found fault with the people and said: </font>
