<font >The point of what we are saying is this:
We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the
throne of the Majesty in heaven, and who ministers in the sanctuary
and true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man. And since every
high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, it was

priest, since there are already priests who offer gifts according to
the law. The place where they serve is a copy and shadow of what is
