<span class="reftext">2</span>and who ministers in the sanctuary and true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And since every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, it was necessary for this <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> also to have something to offer.
