<font ><b>Nathan Rebukes David</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD sent Nathan to David, and
when he arrived, he said, “There were two men in a certain city,
one rich and the other poor. The rich man had a great number of sheep
and cattle, but the poor man had nothing except one small ewe lamb
that he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his
children. It shared his food and drank from his cup; it slept in his
arms and was like a daughter to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now a traveler came to the rich man, who
refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare for
the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the poor man’s
lamb and prepared it for his guest.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David burned with anger against the man
and said to Nathan: “As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did
this deserves to die! Because he has done this thing and has shown no
pity, he must pay for the lamb four times over.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Nathan said to David, “You are that
man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed
you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. I
gave your master’s house to you and your master’s wives into your
arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah, and if that was not
enough, I would have given you even more. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Why then have you despised the command of
the LORD by doing evil in His sight? You put Uriah the Hittite to the
sword and took his wife as your own, for you have slain him with the
sword of the Ammonites. Now, therefore, the sword will never depart
from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife
of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the LORD says: ‘I will
raise up adversity against you from your own house. Before your very
eyes I will take your wives and give them to another, and he will lie
with them in broad daylight. You have acted in secret, but I will do
this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David said to Nathan, “I have
sinned against the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >The LORD has taken away your sin,”
Nathan replied. “You will not die. Nevertheless, because by this
deed you have shown utter contempt for the word of the LORD, the son
born to you will surely die.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Nathan had gone home, the LORD
struck the child that Uriah’s wife had borne to David, and he
became ill. David pleaded with God for the boy. He fasted and went
into his house and spent the night lying in sackcloth on the ground.
The elders of his household stood beside him to help him up from the
ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat anything with them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the seventh day the child died. But
David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead,
for they said, “Look, while the child was alive, we spoke to him,
and he would not listen to us. So how can we tell him the child is
dead? He may even harm himself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When David saw that his servants were
whispering to one another, he perceived that the child was dead. So
he asked his servants, “Is the child dead?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >He is dead,” they replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David got up from the ground, washed
and anointed himself, changed his clothes, and went into the house of
the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his
request they set food before him, and he ate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What is this you have done?” his
servants asked. “While the child was alive, you fasted and wept,
but when he died, you got up and ate.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David answered, “While the child was
alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, ‘Who knows? The LORD may be
gracious to me and let him live.’ But now that he is dead, why
should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he
will not return to me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba,
and he went to her and lay with her. So she gave birth to a son, and
they named him Solomon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the LORD loved the child and sent word
through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah because the LORD
loved him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, Joab fought against Rabbah of
the Ammonites and captured the royal fortress. Then Joab sent
messengers to David to say, “I have fought against Rabbah and have
captured the water supply of the city. Now, therefore, assemble the
rest of the troops, lay siege to the city, and capture it. Otherwise
I will capture the city, and it will be named after me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David assembled all the troops and went
to Rabbah; and he fought against it and captured it. Then he took the
crown from the head of their king. It weighed a talent of gold and
was set with precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head.
And David took a great amount of plunder from the city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David brought out the people who were
there and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes, and he
made them work at the brick kilns. He did the same to all the
Ammonite cities. Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.
