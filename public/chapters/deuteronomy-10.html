<span class="reftext">2</span>And I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke; and you are to place them in the ark.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So I made an ark of acacia wood, chiseled out two stone tablets like the originals, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> wrote on the tablets what had been written previously, the Ten Commandments<span class="fn">a</span>  that He had spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly. <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> gave them to me,
<span class="reftext">5</span>and I went back down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark I had made, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded me; and there they have remained.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>The Israelites <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> from Beeroth Bene-jaakan<span class="fn">b</span>  to Moserah, where Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest.
<span class="reftext">7</span>From there they <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>At that time <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, to stand before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to serve Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name, as they do to this day.
<span class="reftext">9</span>That is why Levi has no portion or inheritance among his brothers; <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is his inheritance, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God promised him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, like the first time, and that time <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> again listened to me and agreed not to destroy you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me, “Get up. Continue your journey ahead of the people, that they may enter and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them.”

<span class="reftext">13</span>and to keep the commandments and statutes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> that I am giving you this day for your own good?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Behold, to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, and the earth and everything in it.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Yet <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has set His affection on your fathers and loved them. And He has chosen you, their descendants after them, above all the peoples, even to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and stiffen your necks no more.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God, showing no partiality and accepting no bribe.
<span class="reftext">18</span>He executes justice for the fatherless and widow, and He loves the foreigner, giving him food and clothing.
<span class="reftext">19</span>So you also must love the foreigner, since you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>You are to fear <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God and serve Him. Hold fast to Him and take your oaths in His name.
<span class="reftext">21</span>He is your praise and He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome wonders that your eyes have seen.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Your fathers went down to Egypt, seventy in all, and now <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the Ten Words</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">from the wells of the Bene-jaakan</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
