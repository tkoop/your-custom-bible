<font ><b>New Stone Tablets</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time the LORD said to me, “Chisel
out two stone tablets like the originals, come up to Me on the
mountain, and make an ark of wood. And I will write on the tablets
the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke; and you
are to place them in the ark.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I made an ark of acacia wood, chiseled
out two stone tablets like the originals, and went up the mountain
with the two tablets in my hands. And the LORD wrote on the tablets
what had been written previously, the Ten Commandments that He had
spoken to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the
assembly. The LORD gave them to me, and I went back down the mountain
and placed the tablets in the ark I had made, as the LORD had
commanded me; and there they have remained. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Israelites traveled from Beeroth
Bene-jaakan to Moserah, where Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar
his son succeeded him as priest. From there they traveled to
Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with streams of
water. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time the LORD set apart the tribe
of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before
the LORD to serve Him, and to pronounce blessings in His name, as
they do to this day. That is why Levi has no portion or inheritance
among his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God
promised him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I stayed on the mountain forty days and
forty nights, like the first time, and that time the LORD again
listened to me and agreed not to destroy you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to me, “Get up.
Continue your journey ahead of the people, that they may enter and
possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your
God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God by walking in all His
ways, to love Him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and
with all your soul, and to keep the commandments and statutes of the
LORD that I am giving you this day for your own good? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Behold, to the LORD your God belong the
heavens, even the highest heavens, and the earth and everything in
it. Yet the LORD has set His affection on your fathers and loved
them. And He has chosen you, their descendants after them, above all
the peoples, even to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and
stiffen your necks no more. For the LORD your God is God of gods and
Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God, showing no
partiality and accepting no bribe. He executes justice for the
fatherless and widow, and He loves the foreigner, giving him food and
clothing. So you also must love the foreigner, since you yourselves
were foreigners in the land of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are to fear the LORD your God and
serve Him. Hold fast to Him and take your oaths in His name. He is
your praise and He is your God, who has done for you these great and
awesome wonders that your eyes have seen. Your fathers went down to
Egypt, seventy in all, and now the LORD your God has made you as
numerous as the stars in the sky. </font>
