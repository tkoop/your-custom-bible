fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day
you heard it and truly understood the grace of God. You learned it
from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister
of Christ on our behalf, and who also informed us of your love in the
Spirit. </font>

you with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and
understanding, so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord
and may please Him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work,
growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power
according to His glorious might so that you may have full endurance
and patience, and joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has
qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.

fullness dwell in Him, and through Him to reconcile to Himself all
things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace
through the blood of His cross. </font>

continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope
of the gospel you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature
under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. </font>

its servant by the commission God gave me to fully proclaim to you
the word of God, the mystery that was hidden for ages and generations
but is now revealed to His saints. To them God has chosen to make
known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which
is Christ in you, the hope of glory. </font>
