<font >Grace and peace to you from God our

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We always thank God, the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, because we have heard about
your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all the saints— the
faith and love proceeding from the hope stored up for you in heaven,
of which you have already heard in the word of truth, the gospel that
has come to you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All over the world this gospel is bearing
fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day
you heard it and truly understood the grace of God. You learned it
from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister
of Christ on our behalf, and who also informed us of your love in the
Spirit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this reason, since the day we heard
about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill
you with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and
understanding, so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord
and may please Him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work,
growing in the knowledge of God, being strengthened with all power
according to His glorious might so that you may have full endurance
and patience, and joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has
qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.

<font >He has rescued us from the dominion of
darkness and brought us into the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom
we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Son is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn over all creation. For in Him all things were created,
things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones
or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things were created
through Him and for Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He is before all things, and in Him all
things hold together. And He is the head of the body, the church; He
is the beginning and firstborn from among the dead, so that in all
things He may have preeminence. For God was pleased to have all His
fullness dwell in Him, and through Him to reconcile to Himself all
things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace
through the blood of His cross. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once you were alienated from God and were
hostile in your minds, engaged in evil deeds. But now He has
reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present
you holy, unblemished, and blameless in His presence— if indeed you
continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope
of the gospel you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature
under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you,
and I fill up in my flesh what is lacking in regard to Christ’s
afflictions for the sake of His body, which is the church. I became
its servant by the commission God gave me to fully proclaim to you
the word of God, the mystery that was hidden for ages and generations
but is now revealed to His saints. To them God has chosen to make
known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which
is Christ in you, the hope of glory. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We proclaim Him, admonishing and teaching
everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in
Christ. To this end I also labor, striving with all His energy
working powerfully within me. </font>
