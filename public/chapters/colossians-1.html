<span class="reftext">4</span>because we have heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all the saints—
<span class="reftext">5</span>the faith and love proceeding from the hope stored up for you in heaven, of which you have already heard in the word of truth, the gospel
<span class="reftext">6</span>that has come to you. </p><p class="reg1"> All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood the grace of God.
<span class="reftext">7</span>You learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our<span class="fn">b</span>  behalf,
<span class="reftext">8</span>and who also informed us of your love in the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
<span class="reftext">10</span>so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord and may please <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,
<span class="reftext">11</span>being strengthened with all power according to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> glorious might so that you may have full endurance and patience, and joyfully
<span class="reftext">12</span>giving thanks to the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, who has qualified you<span class="fn">c</span>  to share in the inheritance of the saints in the light.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> beloved Son,
<span class="reftext">14</span>in whom we have redemption,<span class="fn">d</span>  the forgiveness of sins.

<span class="reftext">16</span>For in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. All things were created through <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and for <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>He is before all things, and in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> all things hold together.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is the head of the body, the church; <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is the beginning and firstborn from among the dead, so that in all things <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> may have preeminence.
<span class="reftext">19</span>For God was pleased to have all <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> fullness dwell in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>,
<span class="reftext">20</span>and through <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> to reconcile to <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through the blood of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> cross.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Once you were alienated from God and were hostile in your minds, engaging in evil deeds.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But now <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy, unblemished, and blameless in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> presence—
<span class="reftext">23</span>if indeed you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope of the gospel you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature<span class="fn">e</span>  under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
