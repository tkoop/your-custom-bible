<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Warning against Favoritism</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>My brothers, as you hold out your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, do not show favoritism.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Suppose a man comes into your meeting<span class="fn">a</span>  wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.
<span class="reftext">3</span>If you lavish attention on the man in fine clothes and say, “Here is a seat of honor,” but say to the poor man, “You must stand” or “Sit at my feet,”
<span class="reftext">4</span>have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Listen, my beloved brothers: Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom He promised those who love Him?
<span class="reftext">6</span>But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you and drag you into court?
<span class="reftext">7</span>Are they not the ones who blaspheme the noble name by which you have been called?<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>If you really fulfill the royal law stated in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,”<span class="fn">c</span>  you are doing well.
<span class="reftext">9</span>But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,”<span class="fn">d</span>  also said, “Do not murder.”<span class="fn">e</span>  If you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
</p><p class="hdg">Faith and Works<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Galatians 3:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>What good is it, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith, but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?
<span class="reftext">15</span>Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.
<span class="reftext">16</span>If one of you tells him, “Go in peace; stay warm and well fed,” but does not provide for his physical needs, what good is that?
<span class="reftext">17</span>So too, faith by itself, if it does not result in action,<span class="fn">f</span>  is dead.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>But someone will say, “You have faith and I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
<span class="reftext">19</span>You believe that God is one.<span class="fn">g</span>  Good for you! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>O foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is worthless?<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Was not our father Abraham justified by what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
<span class="reftext">22</span>You see that his faith was working with his actions, and his faith was perfected by what he did.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,”<span class="fn">i</span>  and he was called a friend of God.<span class="fn">j</span> 
<span class="reftext">24</span>As you can see, a man is justified by his deeds and not by faith alone.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute justified by her actions when she welcomed the spies<span class="fn">k</span>  and sent them off on another route?
<span class="reftext">26</span>As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">your synagogue</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the noble name invoked upon you</i> or <i class="calibre6">the noble name of Him to whom you belong</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Leviticus 19:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Exodus 20:14; Deuteronomy 5:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">if it does not have works</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">that there is one God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">dead</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Genesis 15:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> See Isaiah 41:8.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">messengers</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
