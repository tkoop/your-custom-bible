<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Warning against Favoritism</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>My brothers, as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> hold out your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, do not show favoritism.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Suppose a man comes into <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> meeting<span class="fn">a</span>  wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.
<span class="reftext">3</span>If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> lavish attention on the man in fine clothes and say, “Here is a seat of <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span>,” but say to the poor man, “You must stand” or “Sit at my feet,”
<span class="reftext">4</span>have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Listen, my beloved brothers: Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> promised those who love <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>?
<span class="reftext">6</span>But <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and drag <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> into court?
<span class="reftext">7</span>Are they not the ones who blaspheme the noble name by which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have been called?<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> really <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> the royal law stated in <span class='cap'>Scripture</span><span class='nocap'>scripture</span>, “Love your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> as yourself,”<span class="fn">c</span>  you are doing well.
<span class="reftext">9</span>But if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> show favoritism, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> who said, “Do not commit adultery,”<span class="fn">d</span>  also said, “Do not murder.”<span class="fn">e</span>  If you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful.

</p><p class="hdg">Faith and Works<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Galatians 3:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>What good is it, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith, but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?
<span class="reftext">15</span>Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.
<span class="reftext">16</span>If one of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> tells him, “Go in peace; stay warm and well fed,” but does not provide for his physical needs, what good is that?
<span class="reftext">17</span>So too, faith by itself, if it does not result in action,<span class="fn">f</span>  is dead.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>But someone will say, “You have faith and I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
<span class="reftext">19</span>You believe that God is one.<span class="fn">g</span>  Good for you! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>O foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is worthless?<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Was not our father Abraham justified by what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
<span class="reftext">22</span>You see that his faith was working with his actions, and his faith was perfected by what he did.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And the <span class='cap'>Scripture</span><span class='nocap'>scripture</span> was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,”<span class="fn">i</span>  and he was called a friend of God.<span class="fn">j</span> 
<span class="reftext">24</span>As <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> can see, a man is justified by his deeds and not by faith alone.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute justified by her actions when she welcomed the spies<span class="fn">k</span>  and sent them off on another route?
