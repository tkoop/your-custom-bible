<font ><b>Faith and Works</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >My brothers, as you hold out your faith in
our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, do not show favoritism. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Suppose a man comes into your meeting
wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby
clothes also comes in. If you lavish attention on the man in fine
clothes and say, “Here is a seat of honor,” but say to the poor
man, “You must stand” or “Sit at my feet,” have you not
discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Listen, my beloved brothers: Has not God
chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and to inherit the
kingdom He promised those who love Him? But you have dishonored the
poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you and drag you into court? Are
they not the ones who blaspheme the noble name by which you have been
called? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If you really fulfill the royal law stated
in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing
well. But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the
law as transgressors. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles
at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. For He who said,
“Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you
do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a
lawbreaker. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Speak and act as those who are going to be
judged by the law that gives freedom. For judgment without mercy will
be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over
judgment. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >What good is it, my brothers, if someone
claims to have faith, but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?
Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one
of you tells him, “Go in peace; stay warm and well fed,” but does
not provide for his physical needs, what good is that? So too, faith
by itself, if it does not result in action, is dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But someone will say, “You have faith
and I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will
show you my faith by my deeds. You believe that God is one. Good for
you! Even the demons believe that—and shudder. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >O foolish man, do you want evidence that
faith without deeds is worthless? Was not our father Abraham
justified by what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
You see that his faith was working with his actions, and his faith
was perfected by what he did. And the Scripture was fulfilled that
says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as
righteousness,” and he was called a friend of God. As you can see,
a man is justified by his deeds and not by faith alone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the same way, was not even Rahab the
prostitute justified by her actions when she welcomed the spies and
sent them off on another route? As the body without the spirit is
dead, so faith without deeds is dead. </font>
