<span class="reftext">2</span>Just then some men brought<span class="fn">a</span>  to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> a paralytic lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said to the paralytic, <span>“Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>On seeing this, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But Jesus knew<span class="fn">b</span>  what they were thinking and said, <span>“Why do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> <span class='spell ca'>harbour</span><span class='spell gb'>harbour</span><span class='spell us'>harbor</span> evil in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hearts?
<span class="reftext">5</span>Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’
<span class="reftext">6</span>But so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may know that the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of Man has authority on <span class='nocap'>Earth</span><span class='cap'>Earth</span><span class='bsb'>earth</span> to forgive sins...”</span> Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said to the paralytic, <span>“Get up, pick up your mat, and go home.”</span>
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the man got up and went home.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When the crowds saw this, they were filled with awe and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Later, as Jesus was dining at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples.
<span class="reftext">11</span>When the Pharisees saw this, they asked <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples, “Why does <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> <span class='cap'>Teacher</span><span class='nocap'>teacher</span><span class='bsb'>Teacher</span> eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>On hearing this, Jesus said, <span>“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
<span class="reftext">13</span>But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’<span class="fn">c</span>  For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.<span class="fn">d</span>”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Questions about Fasting<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 2:18–20; Luke 5:33–35)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>At that time John’s disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast so often,<span class="fn">e</span>  but <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> disciples do not fast?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Jesus replied, <span>“How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> is with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.</span>

For the patch will pull away from the garment, and a worse tear will result.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">17</span>Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Healing Touch of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 5:21–43; Luke 8:40–56)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>While Jesus was saying these things, a synagogue leader came and knelt before <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>. “My daughter has just died,” he said. “But come and place <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> hand on her, and she will live.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So Jesus got up and went with him, along with <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Suddenly a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years came up behind <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> and touched the fringe of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> cloak.
<span class="reftext">21</span>She said to herself, “If only I touch <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> cloak, I will be healed.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Jesus turned and saw her. <span>“Take courage, daughter,”</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said, <span>“your faith has healed you.”</span> And the woman was cured from that very hour.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When Jesus entered the house of the synagogue leader, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> saw the flute players and the noisy crowd.
<span><span class="reftext">24</span>“Go away,”</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> told them. <span>“The girl is not dead, but asleep.”</span> And they laughed at <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>After the crowd had been put outside, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And the news about this spread throughout that region.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals the Blind and Mute<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 7:31–37)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, crying out, “Have mercy on us, <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of David!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>After Jesus had entered the house, the blind men came to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>. <span>“Do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> believe that I am able to do this?”</span> He asked. </p><p class="reg1">“Yes, Lord,” they answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> touched their eyes and said, <span>“According to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faith will it be done to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”</span>
<span class="reftext">30</span>And their eyes were opened. Jesus warned them sternly, <span>“See that no one finds out about this!”</span>
<span class="reftext">31</span>But they went out and spread the news about <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> throughout the land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>As they were leaving, a demon-possessed man who was mute was brought to Jesus.
<span class="reftext">33</span>And when the demon had been driven out, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>But the Pharisees said, “It is by the prince of demons that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> drives out demons.”

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples, <span>“The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
