<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus got into a boat, crossed over, and
came to His own town. Just then some men brought to Him a paralytic
lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic,
<font color="#a80000">“Take courage, son; your sins are forgiven.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On seeing this, some of the scribes said
to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus knew what they were thinking and
said, <font color="#a80000">“Why do you harbor evil in your hearts?
Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say,
‘Get up and walk?’ But so that you may know that the Son of Man
has authority on earth to forgive sins...”</font> Then He said to
the paralytic, <font color="#a80000">“Get up, pick up your mat, and
go home.”</font> And the man got up and went home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the crowds saw this, they were filled
with awe and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Jesus went on from there, He saw a man
named Matthew sitting at the tax booth. <font color="#a80000">“Follow
Me,”</font> He told him, and Matthew got up and followed Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Later, as Jesus was dining at Matthew’s
house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with Him and His
disciples. When the Pharisees saw this, they asked His disciples,
“Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On hearing this, Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“It
is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn
what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not
come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time John’s disciples came to
Jesus and asked, “Why is it that we and the Pharisees fast so
often, but Your disciples do not fast?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“How
can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while He is with them? But the
time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they
will fast.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >No one sews a patch
of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. For the patch will pull away
from the garment, and a worse tear will result. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Neither do men pour
new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the
wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, they pour
new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Jesus was saying these things, a
synagogue leader came and knelt before Him. “My daughter has just
died,” he said. “But come and place Your hand on her, and she
will live.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jesus got up and went with him, along
with His disciples. Suddenly a woman who had suffered from bleeding
for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His
cloak. She said to herself, “If only I touch His cloak, I will be
healed.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus turned and saw her. <font color="#a80000">“Take
courage, daughter,”</font> He said, <font color="#a80000">“your
faith has healed you.”</font> And the woman was cured from that
very hour. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus entered the house of the
synagogue leader, He saw the flute players and the noisy crowd. <font color="#a80000">“Go
away,”</font> He told them. <font color="#a80000">“The girl is
not dead, but asleep.”</font> And they laughed at Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After the crowd had been put outside,
Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. And the
news about this spread throughout that region. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Jesus went on from there, two blind men
followed Him, crying out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Jesus had entered the house, the
blind men came to Him. <font color="#a80000">“Do you believe that I
am able to do this?”</font> He asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Yes, Lord,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He touched their eyes and said,
<font color="#a80000">“According to your faith will it be done to
you.”</font> And their eyes were opened. Jesus warned them sternly,
<font color="#a80000">“See that no one finds out about this!”</font>
But they went out and spread the news about Him throughout the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As they were leaving, a demon-possessed
man who was mute was brought to Jesus. And when the demon had been
driven out, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed and said,
“Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the Pharisees said, “It is by the
prince of demons that He drives out demons.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus went through all the towns and
villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the
kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness. When He saw the
crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were
harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He said to His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“The
harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the
harvest, therefore, to send out workers into His harvest.”</font> </font>
