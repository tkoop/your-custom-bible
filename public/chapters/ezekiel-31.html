well-watered trees would reach them in height. For they have all been
consigned to death, to the depths of the earth, among the mortals who
descend to the Pit.’ </font>

restrained. I made Lebanon mourn for it, and all the trees of the
field fainted because of it. I made the nations quake at the sound of
its downfall, when I cast it down to Sheol with those who descend to
the Pit. </font>

the sword. As its allies they had lived in its shade among the
nations. </font>

greatness among the trees of Eden? You also will be brought down to
the depths of the earth to be with the trees of Eden. You will lie
among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword. This is
Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord GOD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
