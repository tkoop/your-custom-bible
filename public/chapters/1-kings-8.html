<span class="reftext">2</span>And all the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the feast in the seventh month,<span class="fn">a</span>  the month of Ethanim.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark,
<span class="reftext">4</span>and they brought up the ark of the LORD and the Tent of Meeting with all its sacred furnishings. So the priests and Levites carried them up.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>There, before the ark, King Solomon and the whole congregation of Israel who had assembled with him sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place,<span class="fn">c</span>  beneath the wings of the cherubim.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its poles.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>The poles extended far enough that their ends were visible from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place;<span class="fn">d</span>  and they are there to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb,<span class="fn">e</span>  where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites after they had come out of the land of Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, the cloud filled the house of the LORD
<span class="reftext">11</span>so that the priests could not stand there to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD.
</p><p class="hdg">Solomon Blesses the LORD<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 6:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Solomon declared: </p><p class="indent1stline">“The LORD<span class="fn">f</span>  has said that He would dwell </p><p class="indent"> in the thick cloud.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I have indeed built You an exalted house, </p><p class="indent"> a place for You to dwell forever.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And as the whole assembly of Israel stood there, the king turned around and blessed them all
<span class="reftext">15</span>and said: </p><p class="tab1stline">“Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has fulfilled with His own hand what He spoke with His mouth to my father David, saying,
<span class="reftext">16</span>‘Since the day I brought My people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel in which to build a house so that My Name would be there. But I have chosen David to be over My people Israel.’
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>Now it was in the heart of my father David to build a house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
<span class="reftext">18</span>But the LORD said to my father David, ‘Since it was in your heart to build a house for My Name, you have done well to have this in your heart.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Nevertheless, you are not the one to build it; but your son, your own offspring, will build the house for My Name.’
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now the LORD has fulfilled the word that He spoke. I have succeeded my father David, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised. I have built the house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And there I have provided a place for the ark, which contains the covenant of the LORD that He made with our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.”
</p><p class="hdg">Solomon’s Prayer of Dedication<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 6:12–42)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven,
<span class="reftext">23</span>and said: </p><p class="tab1stline">“O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth below, keeping Your covenant of loving devotion with Your servants who walk before You with all their hearts.
<span class="reftext">24</span>You have kept Your promise to Your servant, my father David. What You spoke with Your mouth You have fulfilled with Your hand this day.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>Therefore now, O LORD, God of Israel, keep for Your servant, my father David, what You promised when You said: ‘You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants guard their way to walk before Me as you have done.’
<span class="reftext">26</span>And now, O God of Israel, please confirm what You promised to Your servant, my father David.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>But will God indeed dwell upon the earth? Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain You, much less this temple I have built.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Yet regard the prayer and plea of Your servant, O LORD my God, so that You may hear the cry and the prayer that Your servant is praying before You today.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">29</span>May Your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, toward the place of which You said, ‘My Name shall be there,’ so that You may hear the prayer that Your servant prays toward this place.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Hear the plea of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. May You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place. May You hear and forgive.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">31</span>When a man sins against his neighbor and is required to take an oath, and he comes to take an oath before Your altar in this temple,
<span class="reftext">32</span>then may You hear from heaven and act. May You judge Your servants, condemning the wicked man by bringing down on his own head what he has done, and justifying the righteous man by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">33</span>When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy because they have sinned against You, and they return to You and confess Your name, praying and pleading with You in this temple,
<span class="reftext">34</span>then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your people Israel. May You restore them to the land You gave to their fathers.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">35</span>When the skies are shut and there is no rain because Your people have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name, and they turn from their sins because You have afflicted them,
<span class="reftext">36</span>then may You hear from heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants, Your people Israel, so that You may teach them the good way in which they should walk. May You send rain on the land that You gave Your people as an inheritance.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">37</span>When famine or plague comes upon the land, or blight or mildew or locusts or grasshoppers, or when their enemy besieges them in their cities, whatever plague or sickness may come,
<span class="reftext">38</span>then may whatever prayer or petition Your people Israel make—each knowing his own afflictions and spreading out his hands toward this temple—
<span class="reftext">39</span>be heard by You from heaven, Your dwelling place. And may You forgive and act, and repay each man according to all his ways, since You know his heart—for You alone know the hearts of all men—
<span class="reftext">40</span>so that they may fear You all the days they live in the land that You gave to our fathers.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">41</span>And as for the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of Your name—
<span class="reftext">42</span>for they will hear of Your great name and mighty hand and outstretched arm—when he comes and prays toward this temple,
<span class="reftext">43</span>then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You. Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name and fear You, as do Your people Israel, and they will know that this house I have built is called by Your Name.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">44</span>When Your people go to war against their enemies, wherever You send them, and when they pray to the LORD in the direction of the city You have chosen and the house I have built for Your Name,
<span class="reftext">45</span>then may You hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and may You uphold their cause.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">46</span>When they sin against You—for there is no one who does not sin—and You become angry with them and deliver them to an enemy who takes them as captives to his own land, whether far or near,
<span class="reftext">47</span>and when they come to their senses in the land to which they were taken, and they repent and plead with You in the land of their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted wickedly,’
<span class="reftext">48</span>and when they return to You with all their heart and soul in the land of the enemies who took them captive, and when they pray to You in the direction of the land that You gave to their fathers, the city You have chosen, and the house I have built for Your Name,
<span class="reftext">49</span>then may You hear from heaven, Your dwelling place, their prayer and petition, and may You uphold their cause.
<span class="reftext">50</span>May You forgive Your people who have sinned against You and all the transgressions they have committed against You, and may You grant them compassion in the eyes of their captors to show them mercy.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">51</span>For they are Your people and Your inheritance; You brought them out of Egypt, out of the furnace for iron.
<span class="reftext">52</span>May Your eyes be open to the pleas of Your servant and of Your people Israel, and may You listen to them whenever they call to You.
<span class="reftext">53</span>For You, O Lord GOD, as Your inheritance, have set them apart from all the peoples of the earth, as You spoke through Your servant Moses when You brought our fathers out of Egypt.”
</p><p class="hdg">Solomon’s Benediction</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">54</span>Now when Solomon had finished praying this entire prayer and petition to the LORD, he got up before the altar of the LORD, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven.
<span class="reftext">55</span>And he stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying: </p><p class="tab1stline">
<span class="reftext">56</span>“Blessed be the LORD, who has given rest to His people Israel according to all that He promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises He made through His servant Moses.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">57</span>May the LORD our God be with us, as He was with our fathers. May He never leave us nor forsake us.
<span class="reftext">58</span>May He incline our hearts to Himself, to walk in all His ways and to keep the commandments and statutes and ordinances He commanded our fathers.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">59</span>And may these words with which I have made my petition before the LORD be near to the LORD our God day and night, so that He may uphold the cause of His servant and of His people Israel as each day requires,
<span class="reftext">60</span>so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God. There is no other!
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">61</span>So let your heart be fully devoted to the LORD our God, as it is this day, to walk in His statutes and to keep His commandments.”
</p><p class="hdg">Sacrifices of Dedication<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 7:4–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">62</span>Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD.
<span class="reftext">63</span>And Solomon offered as peace offerings to the LORD 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the house of the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">64</span>On that same day the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard in front of the house of the LORD, and there he offered the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, since the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to contain all these offerings.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">65</span>So at that time Solomon and all Israel with him—a great assembly of people from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt—kept the feast before the LORD our God for seven days and seven more days—fourteen days in all.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">66</span>On the fifteenth day<span class="fn">g</span>  Solomon sent the people away. So they blessed the king and went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things that the LORD had done for His servant David and for His people Israel.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the Feast of Tabernacles (or Booths or Shelters); similarly in verse 65; see Leviticus 23:33–36.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Ethanim</i> was the seventh month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar, usually occurring within the months of September and October.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Holy of Holies</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">not from outside</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, Mount Sinai, or possibly a mountain in the range containing Mount Sinai<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Some LXX Manuscripts <i class="calibre6">The Lord has set the sun in the heavens, but</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">66</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">On the eighth day</i>, probably referring to the day following the seven-day feast; see 2 Chronicles 7:9–10.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
