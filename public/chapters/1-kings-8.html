<font >At that time Solomon assembled before him
in Jerusalem the elders of Israel—all the tribal heads and family
leaders of the Israelites—to bring up the ark of the covenant of
the LORD from Zion, the City of David. And all the men of Israel came
together to King Solomon at the feast in the seventh month, the month
of Ethanim. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When all the elders of Israel had arrived,
the priests took up the ark, and they brought up the ark of the LORD
and the Tent of Meeting with all its sacred furnishings. So the
priests and Levites carried them up. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There, before the ark, King Solomon and
the whole congregation of Israel who had assembled with him
sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or
numbered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the priests brought the ark of the
covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the
temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim. For
the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and
overshadowed the ark and its poles. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The poles extended far enough that their
ends were visible from the Holy Place in front of the inner
sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are there to
this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There was nothing in the ark except the
two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the
LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites after they had come out
of the land of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when the priests came out of the Holy
Place, the cloud filled the house of the LORD so that the priests
could not stand there to minister because of the cloud; for the glory
of the LORD filled the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Solomon declared: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >The LORD has said that He would dwell </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >in the thick cloud. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I have indeed built You an exalted house, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >a place for You to dwell forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And as the whole assembly of Israel stood
there, the king turned around and blessed them all and said: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
who has fulfilled with His own hand what He spoke with His mouth to
my father David, saying, ‘Since the day I brought My people Israel
out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel in
which to build a house so that My Name would be there. But I have
chosen David to be over My people Israel.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now it was in the heart of my father David
to build a house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel. But the
LORD said to my father David, ‘Since it was in your heart to build
a house for My Name, you have done well to have this in your heart.
Nevertheless, you are not the one to build it; but your son, your own
offspring, will build the house for My Name.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the LORD has fulfilled the word that
He spoke. I have succeeded my father David, and I sit on the throne
of Israel, as the LORD promised. I have built the house for the Name
of the LORD, the God of Israel. And there I have provided a place for
the ark, which contains the covenant of the LORD that He made with
our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Solomon stood before the altar of the
LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands
toward heaven, and said: </font>
</p>

“<font >O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God
like You in heaven above or on earth below, keeping Your covenant of
loving devotion with Your servants who walk before You with all their
hearts. You have kept Your promise to Your servant, my father David.
What You spoke with Your mouth You have fulfilled with Your hand this
day. </font>

<font >Therefore now, O LORD, God of Israel, keep
for Your servant, my father David, what You promised when You said:
‘You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne
of Israel, if only your descendants guard their way to walk before Me
as you have done.’ And now, O God of Israel, please confirm what
You promised to Your servant, my father David. </font>

servant is praying before You today. </font>

rewarding him according to his righteousness. </font>

temple— be heard by You from heaven, Your dwelling place. And may
You forgive and act, and repay each man according to all his ways,

their captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong; we have

<font >Now when Solomon had finished praying this
entire prayer and petition to the LORD, he got up before the altar of
the LORD, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward

His commandments.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king and all Israel with him
offered sacrifices before the LORD. And Solomon offered as peace
offerings to the LORD 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and
all the Israelites dedicated the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On that same day the king consecrated the
middle of the courtyard in front of the house of the LORD, and there
he offered the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of

small to contain all these offerings. </font>

seven more days—fourteen days in all. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the fifteenth day Solomon sent the
people away. So they blessed the king and went home, joyful and glad
in heart for all the good things that the LORD had done for His
servant David and for His people Israel. </font>
