<font ><b>Sins Requiring a Guilt Offering</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “If someone
sins and acts unfaithfully against the LORD by deceiving his neighbor
in regard to a deposit or security entrusted to him or stolen, or if
he extorts his neighbor or finds lost property and lies about it and
swears falsely, or if he commits any such sin that a man might
commit— once he has sinned and becomes guilty, he must return what
he has stolen or taken by extortion, or the deposit entrusted to him,
or the lost property he found, or anything else about which he has
sworn falsely. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He must make restitution in full, add a
fifth of the value, and pay it to the owner on the day he
acknowledges his guilt. Then he must bring to the priest his guilt
offering to the LORD: an unblemished ram of proper value from the
flock. In this way the priest will make atonement for him before the
LORD, and he will be forgiven for anything he may have done to incur
guilt.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Command
Aaron and his sons that this is the law of the burnt offering: The
burnt offering is to remain on the hearth of the altar all night,
until morning, and the fire must be kept burning on the altar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the priest shall put on his linen robe
and linen undergarments, and he shall remove from the altar the ashes
of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed and place them
beside it. Then he must take off his garments, put on other clothes,
and carry the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The fire on the altar shall be kept
burning; it must not be extinguished. Every morning the priest is to
add wood to the fire, arrange the burnt offering on it, and burn the
fat portions of the peace offerings on it. The fire shall be kept
burning on the altar continually; it must not be extinguished. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now this is the law of the grain offering:
Aaron’s sons shall present it before the LORD in front of the
altar. The priest is to remove a handful of fine flour and olive oil,
together with all the frankincense from the grain offering, and burn
the memorial portion on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Aaron and his sons are to eat the
remainder. It must be eaten without leaven in a holy place; they are
to eat it in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting. It must not be
baked with leaven; I have assigned it as their portion of My
offerings made by fire. It is most holy, like the sin offering and
the guilt offering. Any male among the sons of Aaron may eat it. This
is a permanent portion from the offerings made by fire to the LORD
for the generations to come. Anything that touches them will become
holy.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “This is
the offering that Aaron and his sons must present to the LORD on the
day he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular
grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening. It
shall be prepared with oil on a griddle; you are to bring it
well-kneaded and present it as a grain offering broken in pieces, a
pleasing aroma to the LORD. The priest, who is one of Aaron’s sons
and will be anointed to take his place, is to prepare it. As a
permanent portion for the LORD, it must be burned completely. Every
grain offering for a priest shall be burned completely; it is not to
be eaten.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron
and his sons that this is the law of the sin offering: In the place
where the burnt offering is slaughtered, the sin offering shall be
slaughtered before the LORD; it is most holy. The priest who offers
it shall eat it; it must be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard
of the Tent of Meeting. Anything that touches its flesh will become
holy, and if any of the blood is spattered on a garment, you must
wash it in a holy place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The clay pot in which the sin offering is
boiled must be broken; if it is boiled in a bronze pot, the pot must
be scoured and rinsed with water. Any male among the priests may eat
it; it is most holy. But no sin offering may be eaten if its blood
has been brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the
Holy Place; it must be burned. </font>
