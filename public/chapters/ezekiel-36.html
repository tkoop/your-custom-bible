<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">And you, son of man, prophesy to the
mountains of Israel and say: O mountains of Israel, hear the word of
the LORD. This is what the Lord GOD says: Because the enemy has said
of you, ‘Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession,’
therefore prophesy and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says:
Because they have made you desolate and have trampled you on every
side, so that you became a possession of the rest of the nations and
were taken up in slander by the lips of their talkers, therefore, O
mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what the Lord GOD says to the
mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate
ruins and abandoned cities, which have become a spoil and a mockery
to the rest of the nations around you. Therefore this is what the
Lord GOD says: Surely in My burning zeal I have spoken against the
rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who took My land as their
own possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, so that its
pastureland became plunder. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, prophesy concerning the land of
Israel and tell the mountains and hills, the ravines and valleys,
that this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I have spoken in My
burning zeal because you have endured the reproach of the nations. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
I have sworn with an uplifted hand that surely the nations around you
will endure reproach of their own. But you, O mountains of Israel,
will produce branches and bear fruit for My people Israel, for they
will soon come home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For behold, I am on your side; I will turn
toward you, and you will be tilled and sown. I will multiply the
people upon you—the house of Israel in its entirety. The cities
will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. I will fill you with people
and animals, and they will multiply and be fruitful. I will make you
as inhabited as you once were, and I will make you prosper more than
before. Then you will know that I am the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Yes, I will cause My people Israel to walk
upon you; they will possess you, and you will be their inheritance,
and you will no longer deprive them of their children. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For this is what the Lord GOD says:
Because people say to you, ‘You devour men and deprive your nation
of its children,’ therefore you will no longer devour men or
deprive your nation of its children, declares the Lord GOD. I will no
longer allow the taunts of the nations to be heard against you, and
you will no longer endure the reproach of the peoples or cause your
nation to stumble, declares the Lord GOD.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Again the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, when the people of Israel lived in their land,
they defiled it by their own ways and deeds. Their behavior before Me
was like the uncleanness of a woman’s impurity. So I poured out My
wrath upon them because of the blood they had shed on the land, and
because they had defiled it with their idols. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I dispersed them among the nations, and
they were scattered throughout the lands. I judged them according to
their ways and deeds. And wherever they went among the nations, they
profaned My holy name, because it was said of them, ‘These are the
people of the LORD, yet they had to leave His land.’ But I had
concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned
among the nations to which they had gone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore tell the house of Israel that
this is what the Lord GOD says: It is not for your sake that I will
act, O house of Israel, but for My holy name, which you profaned
among the nations to which you went. I will show the holiness of My
great name, which has been profaned among the nations—the name you
have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the
LORD, declares the Lord GOD, when I show My holiness in you before
their eyes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For I will take you from among the nations
and gather you out of all the countries, and I will bring you back
into your own land. I will also sprinkle clean water on you, and you
will be clean. I will cleanse you from all your impurities and all
your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within
you; I will remove your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My
statutes and to carefully observe My ordinances. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then you will live in the land that I gave
your forefathers; you will be My people, and I will be your God. I
will save you from all your uncleanness. I will summon the grain and
make it plentiful, and I will not bring famine upon you. I will also
make the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field plentiful, so
that you will no longer bear reproach among the nations on account of
famine. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then you will remember your evil ways and
wicked deeds, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and
abominations. It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the
Lord GOD—let it be known to you. Be ashamed and disgraced for your
ways, O house of Israel! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what the Lord GOD says: On the day
I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be
resettled and the ruins to be rebuilt. The desolate land will be
cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass
through. Then they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has
become like the garden of Eden. The cities that were once ruined,
desolate, and destroyed are now fortified and inhabited.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the nations around you that remain
will know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt what was destroyed, and I
have replanted what was desolate. I, the LORD, have spoken, and I
will do it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what the Lord GOD says: Once again
I will hear the plea of the house of Israel and do for them this: I
will multiply their people like a flock. Like the numerous flocks for
sacrifices at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so the ruined
cities will be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that
I am the LORD.” </font>
