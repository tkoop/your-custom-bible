<span class="reftext">2</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: Because the enemy has said of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, ‘Aha! The ancient heights have become our possession,’
<span class="reftext">3</span>therefore prophesy and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: Because they have made you desolate and have trampled <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> on every side, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> became a possession of the rest of the nations and were taken up in slander by the lips of their talkers,
<span class="reftext">4</span>therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. </p><p class="reg1"> This is what the Lord GOD says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate ruins and abandoned cities, which have become a spoil and a mockery to the rest of the nations around you.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Surely in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> burning zeal I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who took <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> land as their own possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, so that its pastureland became plunder.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore, prophesy concerning the land of Israel and tell the mountains and hills, the ravines and valleys, that this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I have spoken in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> burning zeal because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have endured the reproach of the nations.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: I have sworn with an uplifted hand that surely the nations around <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will endure reproach of their own.
<span class="reftext">8</span>But <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, O mountains of Israel, will produce branches and bear fruit for <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people Israel, for they will soon come home.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>For behold, I am on <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> side; I will turn toward <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be tilled and sown.
<span class="reftext">10</span>I will multiply the people upon <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>—the house of Israel in its entirety. The cities will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.
<span class="reftext">11</span>I will fill you with people and animals, and they will multiply and be fruitful. I will make you as inhabited as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> once were, and I will make you prosper more than before. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Yes, I will cause <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people Israel to walk upon <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>; they will possess you, and you will be their inheritance, and you will no longer deprive them of their children.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>For this is what the Lord GOD says: Because people say to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, ‘You devour men and deprive your nation of its children,’
<span class="reftext">14</span>therefore you will no longer devour men or deprive your nation of its children, declares the Lord GOD.
<span class="reftext">15</span>I will no longer allow the taunts of the nations to be heard against you, and you will no longer endure the reproach of the peoples or cause your nation to stumble, declares the Lord GOD.”
</p><p class="hdg">A New Heart and a New Spirit<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Romans 8:9–11; Galatians 5:16–26)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Again the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">17</span>“Son of man, when the people of Israel lived in their land, they defiled it by their own ways and deeds. Their <span class='spell ca'>behaviour</span><span class='spell gb'>behaviour</span><span class='spell us'>behavior</span> before <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> was like the uncleanness of a woman’s impurity.
<span class="reftext">18</span>So I poured out <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> wrath upon them because of the blood they had shed on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>I dispersed them among the nations, and they were scattered throughout the lands. I judged them according to their ways and deeds.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And wherever they went among the nations, they profaned <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> holy name, because it was said of them, ‘These are the people of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, yet they had to leave <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> land.’
<span class="reftext">21</span>But I had concern for <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they had gone.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Therefore tell the house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: It is not for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sake that I will act, O house of Israel, but for <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> holy name, which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> profaned among the nations to which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> went.
<span class="reftext">23</span>I will show the holiness of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> great name, which has been profaned among the nations—the name <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, declares the Lord GOD, when I show <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> holiness in <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> before their eyes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>For I will take <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from among the nations and gather <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> out of all the countries, and I will bring <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> back into your own land.
<span class="reftext">25</span>I will also sprinkle clean water on <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be clean. I will cleanse <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from all <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> impurities and all <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> idols.
<span class="reftext">26</span>I will give <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will remove your heart of stone and give <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> a heart of flesh.
<span class="reftext">27</span>And I will put <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> within you and cause <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to walk in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> statutes and to carefully observe <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> ordinances.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will live in the land that I gave <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> forefathers; <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people, and I will be <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God.
<span class="reftext">29</span>I will save <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from all <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> uncleanness. I will summon the grain and make it plentiful, and I will not bring famine upon <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">30</span>I will also make the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field plentiful, so that you will no longer bear reproach among the nations on account of famine.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will remember <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> evil ways and wicked deeds, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will loathe yourselves for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> iniquities and abominations.
<span class="reftext">32</span>It is not for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sake that I will act, declares the Lord GOD—let it be known to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. Be ashamed and disgraced for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> ways, O house of Israel!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: On the day I cleanse <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from all <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> iniquities, I will cause the cities to be resettled and the ruins to be rebuilt.
<span class="reftext">34</span>The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through.
<span class="reftext">35</span>Then they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden. The cities that were once ruined, desolate, and destroyed are now fortified and inhabited.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Then the nations around <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> that remain will know that I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have rebuilt what was destroyed, and I have replanted what was desolate. I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have spoken, and I will do it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: Once again I will hear the plea of the house of Israel and do for them this: I will multiply their people like a flock.
<span class="reftext">38</span>Like the numerous flocks for sacrifices at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so the ruined cities will be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
