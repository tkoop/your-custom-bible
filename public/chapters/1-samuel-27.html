<font ><b>David and the Philistines</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David, however, said to himself, “One of
these days now I will be swept away by the hand of Saul. There is
nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines.
Then Saul will stop searching for me all over Israel, and I will slip
out of his hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David set out with his six hundred men
and went to Achish son of Maoch, the king of Gath. David and his men
settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and
David had his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel,
the widow of Nabal. And when Saul learned that David had fled to
Gath, he no longer searched for him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David said to Achish, “If I have
found favor in your eyes, let me be assigned a place in one of the
outlying towns, so I can live there. For why should your servant live
in the royal city with you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That day Achish gave him Ziklag, and to
this day it still belongs to the kings of Judah. And the time that
David lived in Philistine territory amounted to a year and four
months. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now David and his men went up and raided
the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. (From ancient times
these people had inhabited the land extending to Shur and Egypt.)
Whenever David attacked a territory, he did not leave a man or woman
alive, but he took the flocks and herds, the donkeys, camels, and
clothing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he would return to Achish, who would
ask him, “What have you raided today?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David would reply, “The Negev of
Judah,” or “The Negev of Jerahmeel,” or “The Negev of the
Kenites.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David did not leave a man or woman alive
to be brought to Gath, for he said, “Otherwise they will report us,
saying, ‘This is what David did.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
And this was David’s custom the whole time he lived in Philistine
territory. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Achish trusted David, thinking, “Since
he has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel, he will be
my servant forever.” </font>
