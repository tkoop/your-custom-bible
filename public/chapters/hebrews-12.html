<font ><b>An Unshakable Kingdom</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, since we are surrounded by such
a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off every encumbrance and
the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with endurance the
race set out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and
perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the
cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the
throne of God. Consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners,
so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In your struggle against sin, you have not
yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. And you have
forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >My son, do not take lightly the
discipline of the Lord, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and do not lose heart when He rebukes you.
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >For the Lord disciplines the one He loves,
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and He chastises every son He receives.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Endure suffering as discipline; God is
treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father?
If you do not experience discipline like everyone else, then you are
illegitimate children and not true sons. Furthermore, we have all had
earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them. Should we
not much more submit to the Father of our spirits and live? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Our fathers disciplined us for a short
time as they thought best, but God disciplines us for our good, so
that we may share in His holiness. No discipline seems enjoyable at
the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields a harvest of
righteousness and peace to those who have been trained by it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore strengthen your limp hands and
weak knees. Make straight paths for your feet, so that the lame may
not be disabled, but rather healed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Pursue peace with everyone, as well as
holiness, without which no one will see the Lord. See to it that no
one falls short of the grace of God, and that no root of bitterness
springs up to cause trouble and defile many. See to it that no one is
sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold
his birthright. For you know that afterward, when he wanted to
inherit the blessing, he was rejected. He could find no ground for
repentance, though he sought the blessing with tears. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For you have not come to a mountain that
can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom, and
storm; to a trumpet blast or to a voice that made its hearers beg
that no further word be spoken. For they could not bear what was
commanded: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be
stoned.” The sight was so terrifying that even Moses said, “I am
trembling with fear.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to
the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to
myriads of angels in joyful assembly, to the congregation of the
firstborn, enrolled in heaven. You have come to God the Judge of all,
to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, to Jesus the mediator
of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better
word than the blood of Abel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >See to it that you do not refuse Him who
speaks. For if the people did not escape when they refused Him who
warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we reject Him
who warns us from heaven? At that time His voice shook the earth, but
now He has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth,
but heaven as well.” The words “Once more” signify the removal
of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that the
unshakable may remain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, since we are receiving an
unshakable kingdom, let us be filled with gratitude, and so worship
God acceptably with reverence and awe. “For our God is a consuming
fire.” </font>
