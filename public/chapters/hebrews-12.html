<span class="reftext">2</span>Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author<span class="fn">a</span>  and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Consider <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> who endured such hostility from sinners, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will not grow weary and lose heart.

<span class="reftext">5</span>And <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have forgotten the exhortation that addresses <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> as sons: </p><p class="indent1stline">“My son, do not take lightly the discipline of the Lord, </p><p class="indent"> and do not lose heart when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> rebukes you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For the Lord disciplines the one <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> loves, </p><p class="indent"> and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> chastises every son <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> receives.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Endure suffering as discipline; God is treating <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father?
<span class="reftext">8</span>If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not experience discipline like everyone else, then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are illegitimate children and not true sons.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Furthermore, we have all had earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them. Should we not much more submit to the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> of our spirits and live?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Our fathers disciplined us for a short time as they thought best, but God disciplines us for our good, so that we may share in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> holiness.
<span class="reftext">11</span>No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields a harvest of righteousness and peace<span class="fn">c</span>  to those who have been trained by it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore strengthen <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> limp hands and weak knees.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Make straight paths for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> feet,<span class="fn">e</span>  so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed.

<span class="reftext">15</span>See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God, and that no root of bitterness<span class="fn">f</span>  springs up to cause trouble and defile many.
<span class="reftext">16</span>See to it that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his birthright.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected. He could find no ground for repentance, though he sought the blessing with tears.

<span class="reftext">20</span>For they could not bear what was commanded: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned.”<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>The sight was so terrifying that even Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.”<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Instead, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have come to myriads of angels

<span class="reftext">26</span>At that time <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> voice shook the earth, but now <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth, but <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> as well.”<span class="fn">j</span> 
<span class="reftext">27</span>The words “Once more” signify the removal of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that the unshakable may remain.
