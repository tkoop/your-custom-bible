</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>This is the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, your Maker, </p><p class="indent"> who formed you from the womb and who will help you: </p><p class="indent1">“Do not be afraid, O Jacob My servant, </p><p class="indent"> Jeshurun,<span class="fn">a</span>  whom I have chosen.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For I will pour water on the thirsty land, </p><p class="indent"> and currents on the dry ground. </p><p class="indent1"> I will pour out My Spirit on your descendants, </p><p class="indent"> and My blessing on your offspring.

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Thus says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, </p><p class="indent"> the King and Redeemer of Israel, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I am the first and I am the last, </p><p class="indent"> and there is no God but Me.

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>All makers of idols are nothing, </p><p class="indent"> and the things they treasure are worthless. </p><p class="indent1"> Their witnesses fail to see or comprehend, </p><p class="indent"> so they are put to shame.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Who fashions a god or casts an idol </p><p class="indent"> which profits him nothing?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Behold, all his companions will be put to shame, </p><p class="indent"> for the craftsmen themselves are only human. </p><p class="indent1"> Let them all assemble and take their stand; </p><p class="indent"> they will all be brought to terror and shame.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>The woodworker extends a measuring line; </p><p class="indent"> he marks it out with a stylus; </p><p class="indent1"> he shapes it with chisels </p><p class="indent"> and outlines it with a compass. </p><p class="indent1"> He fashions it in the likeness of man, </p><p class="indent"> like man in all his glory, </p><p class="indent"> that it may dwell in a shrine.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>He cuts down cedars </p><p class="indent"> or retrieves a cypress<span class="fn">c</span>  or oak. </p><p class="indent1"> He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. </p><p class="indent"> He plants a laurel, and the rain makes it grow.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>It serves as fuel for man. </p><p class="indent"> He takes some of it to warm himself, </p><p class="indent1"> and he kindles a fire </p><p class="indent"> and bakes his bread; </p><p class="indent1"> he even fashions it into a god and worships it; </p><p class="indent"> he makes an idol and bows down to it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>He burns half of it in the fire, </p><p class="indent"> and he roasts meat on that half. </p><p class="indent1"> He eats the roast and is satisfied. </p><p class="indent"> Indeed, he warms himself and says, </p><p class="indent">“Ah!

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>From the rest he makes a god, his graven image. </p><p class="indent"> He bows down to it and worships; </p><p class="indent1"> he prays to it and says, </p><p class="indent">“Save me, for you are my god.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>They do not comprehend or discern, </p><p class="indent"> for He has shut their eyes so they cannot see </p><p class="indent"> and closed their minds so they cannot understand.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And no one considers in his heart, </p><p class="indent"> no one has the knowledge or insight to say, </p><p class="indent1">“I burned half of it in the fire, </p><p class="indent"> and I baked bread on its coals; </p><p class="indent"> I roasted meat and I ate. </p><p class="indent1"> Shall I make something detestable with the rest of it? </p><p class="indent"> Shall I bow down to a block of wood?”
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>He feeds on ashes. </p><p class="indent"> His deluded heart has led him astray, </p><p class="indent1"> and he cannot deliver himself or say, </p><p class="indent">“Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?”
