</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you </p><p class="indent"> that there is more to be said on God’s behalf.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>I get my knowledge from afar, </p><p class="indent"> and I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>For truly my words are free of falsehood; </p><p class="indent"> one perfect in knowledge is with you.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Indeed, God is mighty, but He despises no one; </p><p class="indent"> He is mighty in strength of understanding.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>He does not keep the wicked alive, </p><p class="indent"> but He grants justice to the afflicted.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>He does not take His eyes off the righteous, </p><p class="indent"> but He enthrones them with kings </p><p class="indent"> and exalts them forever.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>And if men are bound with chains, </p><p class="indent"> caught in cords of affliction,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>then He tells them their deeds </p><p class="indent"> and how arrogantly they have transgressed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>He opens their ears to correction </p><p class="indent"> and commands that they turn from iniquity.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>If they obey and serve Him, </p><p class="indent"> then they end their days in prosperity </p><p class="indent"> and their years in happiness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But if they do not obey, </p><p class="indent"> then they perish by the sword<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and die without knowledge.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>The godless in heart <span class='spell ca'>harbour</span><span class='spell gb'>harbour</span><span class='spell us'>harbor</span> resentment; </p><p class="indent"> even when He binds them, they do not cry for help.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>They die in their youth, </p><p class="indent"> among the male shrine prostitutes.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>God rescues the afflicted by their affliction<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and opens their ears in oppression.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>Indeed, He drew you from the jaws of distress </p><p class="indent"> to a spacious and broad place, </p><p class="indent"> to a table full of richness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>But now you are laden with the <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> due the wicked; </p><p class="indent"> <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> and justice have seized you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Be careful that no one lures you with riches; </p><p class="indent"> do not let a large bribe lead you astray.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Can your wealth<span class="fn">c</span>  or all your mighty effort </p><p class="indent"> keep you from distress?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Do not long for the night, </p><p class="indent"> when people vanish from their homes.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Be careful not to turn to iniquity, </p><p class="indent"> for this you have preferred to affliction.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>Behold, God is exalted in His power. </p><p class="indent"> Who is a teacher like Him?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Who has appointed His way for Him, </p><p class="indent"> or told Him, ‘You have done wrong’?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Remember to magnify His work, </p><p class="indent"> which men have praised in song.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>All mankind has seen it; </p><p class="indent"> men behold it from afar.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Indeed, God is great—beyond our knowledge; </p><p class="indent"> the number of His years is unsearchable.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>For He draws up drops of water </p><p class="indent"> which distill the rain from the mist,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>which the clouds pour out </p><p class="indent"> and shower abundantly on mankind.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Furthermore, who can understand how the clouds spread out, </p><p class="indent"> how the thunder roars from His pavilion?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>See how He scatters His lightning around Him </p><p class="indent"> and covers the depths of the sea.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>For by these He judges<span class="fn">d</span>  the nations </p><p class="indent"> and provides food in abundance.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>He fills His hands with lightning </p><p class="indent"> and commands it to strike its mark.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>The thunder declares His presence; </p><p class="indent"> even the cattle regard the rising storm.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">they will cross the river of death</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in their affliction</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">your cry for help</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">governs</i> or <i class="calibre6">nourishes</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
