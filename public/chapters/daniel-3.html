<font ><b>Nebuchadnezzar’s Golden Statue</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue
sixty cubits high and six cubits wide, and he set it up on the plain
of Dura in the province of Babylon. Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent
word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers,
treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other officials of the
provinces to attend the dedication of the statue he had set up. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the satraps, prefects, governors,
advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the
provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue that King
Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “O
people of every nation and language, this is what you are commanded:
As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp,
pipes, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the
golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. And whoever does
not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the blazing
fiery furnace.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, as soon as all the people heard
the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and all kinds of
music, the people of every nation and language would fall down and
worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this time some astrologers came forward
and maliciously accused the Jews, saying to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O
king, may you live forever! You, O king, have issued a decree that
everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp,
pipes, and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the golden
statue, and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be
thrown into the blazing fiery furnace. But there are some Jews you
have appointed to manage the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego—who have ignored you, O king, and have refused to
serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have set up.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Nebuchadnezzar, furious with rage,
summoned Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So these men were brought
before the king, and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you do not serve my gods or
worship the golden statue I have set up? Now, if you are ready, as
soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp,
pipes, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the
statue I have made. But if you refuse to worship, you will be thrown
at once into the blazing fiery furnace. Then what god will be able to
deliver you from my hands?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to
the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this
matter. If the God whom we serve exists, then He is able to deliver
us from the blazing fiery furnace and from your hand, O king. But
even if He does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not
serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have set up.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, Nebuchadnezzar was filled with
rage, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times
hotter than usual, and he commanded some mighty men of valor in his
army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into
the blazing fiery furnace. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they were tied up, wearing robes,
trousers, turbans, and other clothes, and they were thrown into the
blazing fiery furnace. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The king’s command was so urgent and the
furnace so hot that the fiery flames killed the men who carried up
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. And these three men, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, firmly bound, fell into the blazing fiery
furnace. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Suddenly King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in
amazement and asked his advisers, “Did we not throw three men,
firmly bound, into the fire?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Certainly, O king,” they replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Look!” he exclaimed. “I see four
men, unbound and unharmed, walking around in the fire—and the
fourth looks like a son of the gods!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of
the blazing fiery furnace and called out, “Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came
out of the fire, and when the satraps, prefects, governors, and royal
advisers had gathered around, they saw that the fire had no effect on
the bodies of these men. Not a hair of their heads was singed, their
robes were unaffected, and there was no smell of fire on them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nebuchadnezzar declared, “Blessed be the
God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent His angel and
delivered His servants who trusted in Him. They violated the king’s
command and risked their lives rather than serve or worship any god
except their own God. Therefore I decree that the people of any
nation or language who say anything offensive against the God of
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be cut into pieces and their
houses reduced to rubble. For there is no other god who can deliver
in this way.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego in the province of Babylon. </font>
