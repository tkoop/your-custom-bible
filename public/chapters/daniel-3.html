<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Nebuchadnezzar’s Golden Statue</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>King Nebuchadnezzar made a golden statue<span class="fn">a</span>  sixty cubits high and six cubits wide,<span class="fn">b</span>  and he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Then King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other officials of the provinces to attend the dedication of the statue he had set up.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then the herald loudly proclaimed, “O people of every nation and language, this is what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are commanded:
<span class="reftext">5</span>As soon as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music,<span class="fn">c</span>  <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the blazing fiery furnace.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore, as soon as all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and all kinds of music, the people of every nation and language would fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
</p><p class="hdg">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Accused</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>At this time some astrologers<span class="fn">d</span>  came forward and maliciously accused the Jews,
<span class="reftext">9</span>saying to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, may you live forever!
<span class="reftext">10</span>You, O king, have issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the golden statue,
<span class="reftext">11</span>and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into the blazing fiery furnace.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But there are some Jews you have appointed to manage the province of Babylon—Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—who have ignored you, O king, and have refused to serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have set up.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar, furious with rage, summoned Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king,
<span class="reftext">14</span>and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not serve my gods or worship the golden statue I have set up?
<span class="reftext">15</span>Now, if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are ready, as soon as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and all kinds of music, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must fall down and worship the statue I have made. But if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> refuse to worship, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be thrown at once into the blazing fiery furnace. Then what god will be able to deliver you from my hands?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.
<span class="reftext">17</span>If the God whom we serve exists, then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is able<span class="fn">e</span>  to deliver us from the blazing fiery furnace and from your hand, O king.
<span class="reftext">18</span>But even if <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden statue you have set up.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Fiery Furnace</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>At this, Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage, and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times hotter than usual,
<span class="reftext">20</span>and he commanded some mighty men of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span> in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing fiery furnace.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>So they were tied up, wearing robes, trousers, turbans, and other clothes, and they were thrown into the blazing fiery furnace.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>The king’s command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the fiery flames killed the men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, firmly bound, fell into the blazing fiery furnace.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Suddenly King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and asked his advisers, “Did we not throw three men, firmly bound, into the fire?” </p><p class="reg1">“Certainly, O king,” they replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>“Look!” he exclaimed. “I see four men, unbound and unharmed, walking around in the fire—and the fourth looks like a son of the gods!<span class="fn">f</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the door of the blazing fiery furnace and called out, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span> <span class='cap'>High</span><span class='nocap'>high</span> God, come out!” </p><p class="reg1"> So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire,
<span class="reftext">27</span>and when the satraps, prefects, governors, and royal advisers had gathered around, they saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men. Not a hair of their heads was singed, their robes were unaffected, and there was no smell of fire on them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Nebuchadnezzar declared, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> angel<span class="fn">g</span>  and delivered <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> servants who trusted in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. They violated the king’s command and risked their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything <span class='spell ca'>offencive</span><span class='spell gb'>offencive</span><span class='spell us'>offensive</span> against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be cut into pieces and their houses reduced to rubble. For there is no other god who can deliver in this way.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">image</i>; here and throughout Daniel 3<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> The statue was approximately 90 feet high and 9 feet wide (27.4 meters high and 2.7 meters wide).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> The precise identification of some musical instruments in this chapter is uncertain.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Chaldeans</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">If this be so, then the God whom serve is able</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">like the Son of God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
