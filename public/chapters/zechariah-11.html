<font >that the fire may consume your cedars! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen;
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >the majestic trees are ruined! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Wail, O oaks of Bashan, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >for the dense forest has been cut down! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Listen to the wailing of the shepherds, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >for their glory is in ruins. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Listen to the roaring of the young lions, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >for the thickets of the Jordan are
destroyed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the LORD my God says:
“Pasture the flock marked for slaughter, whose buyers slaughter
them without remorse. Those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the
LORD, for I am rich!’ Even their own shepherds have no compassion
on them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For I will no longer have compassion on
the people of the land, declares the LORD, but behold, I will cause
each man to fall into the hands of his neighbor and his king, who
will devastate the land, and I will not deliver it from their hands.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I pastured the flock marked for
slaughter, especially the afflicted of the flock. Then I took for
myself two staffs, calling one Favor and the other Union, and I
pastured the flock. And in one month I dismissed three shepherds. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >My soul grew impatient with the flock, and
their souls also detested me. Then I said, “I will no longer
shepherd you. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish; and let
those who remain devour one another’s flesh.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next I took my staff called Favor and cut
it in two, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations. It
was revoked on that day, and so the afflicted of the flock who were
watching me knew that it was the word of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I told them, “If it seems right to
you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” So they weighed out
my wages, thirty pieces of silver. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to me, “Throw it to
the potter”—this magnificent price at which they valued me. So I
took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter in the
house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I cut in two my second staff called
Union, breaking the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to me: “Take up once
more the equipment of a foolish shepherd. For behold, I will raise up
a shepherd in the land who will neither care for the lost, nor seek
the young, nor heal the broken, nor sustain the healthy, but he will
devour the flesh of the choice sheep and tear off their hooves. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Woe to the worthless shepherd, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >who deserts the flock! </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >May a sword strike his arm </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and his right eye! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >May his arm be completely withered </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and his right eye utterly blinded!” </font>
