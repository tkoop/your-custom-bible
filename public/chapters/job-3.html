<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Job Laments His Birth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And this is what he said:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>“May the day of my birth perish, </p><p class="indent"> and the night it was said, </p><p class="indent">‘A boy is conceived.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>If only that day had turned to darkness! </p><p class="indent"> May God above disregard it; </p><p class="indent"> may no light shine upon it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>May darkness and gloom reclaim it, </p><p class="indent"> and a cloud settle over it; </p><p class="indent"> may the blackness of the day overwhelm it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>If only darkness had taken that night away! </p><p class="indent"> May it not appear among the days of the year; </p><p class="indent"> may it never be entered in any of the months.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Behold, may that night be barren; </p><p class="indent"> may no joyful voice come into it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>May it be cursed by those who curse the day<span class="fn">a</span> —</p><p class="indent"> those prepared to rouse Leviathan.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>May its morning stars grow dark; </p><p class="indent"> may it wait in vain for daylight; </p><p class="indent"> may it not see the breaking of dawn.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>For that night did not shut the doors of the womb </p><p class="indent"> to hide the sorrow from my eyes.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>Why did I not perish at birth; </p><p class="indent"> why did I not die as I came from the womb?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Why were there knees to receive me, </p><p class="indent"> and breasts that I should be nursed?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>For now I would be lying down in peace; </p><p class="indent"> I would be asleep and at rest
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>with kings and counsellors of the earth, </p><p class="indent"> who built for themselves cities now in ruins,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>or with princes who had gold, </p><p class="indent"> who filled their houses with silver.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child, </p><p class="indent"> like an infant who never sees daylight?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>There the wicked cease from raging, </p><p class="indent"> and there the weary find rest.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>The captives enjoy their ease; </p><p class="indent"> they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Both small and great are there, </p><p class="indent"> and the slave is freed from his master.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Why is light given to the miserable, </p><p class="indent"> and life to the bitter of soul,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>who long for death that does not come, </p><p class="indent"> and search for it like hidden treasure,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>who rejoice and greatly exult </p><p class="indent"> when they can find the grave?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, </p><p class="indent"> whom God has hedged in?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>I sigh when food is put before me, </p><p class="indent"> and my groans pour out like water.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>For the thing I feared has overtaken me, </p><p class="indent"> and what I dreaded has befallen me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>I am not at ease or quiet; </p><p class="indent"> I have no rest, for trouble has come.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">curse the sea</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
