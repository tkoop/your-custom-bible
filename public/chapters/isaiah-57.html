</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; </p><p class="indent"> they find rest, lying down in death.
</p><p class="hdg">God Condemns Idolatry</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>“But come here, you sons of a sorceress, </p><p class="indent"> you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Whom are you mocking? </p><p class="indent"> At whom do you snarl and stick out your tongue? </p><p class="indent1"> Are you not children of transgression, </p><p class="indent"> offspring of deceit,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>who burn with lust among the oaks, </p><p class="indent"> under every luxuriant tree, </p><p class="indent1"> who slaughter your children in the valleys, </p><p class="indent"> under the clefts of the rocks?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Your portion is among the smooth stones of the valley; </p><p class="indent"> indeed, they are your lot. </p><p class="indent1"> Even to them you have poured out a drink offering </p><p class="indent"> and offered a grain offering. </p><p class="indent"> Should I relent because of these?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>On a high and lofty hill you have made your bed, </p><p class="indent"> and there you went up to offer sacrifices.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Behind the door and doorpost </p><p class="indent"> you have set up your memorial. </p><p class="indent1"> Forsaking Me, you uncovered your bed; </p><p class="indent"> you climbed up and opened it wide. </p><p class="indent1"> And you have made a pact with those whose bed you have loved; </p><p class="indent"> you have gazed upon their nakedness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>You went to Molech<span class="fn">a</span>  with oil </p><p class="indent"> and multiplied your perfumes. </p><p class="indent1"> You have sent your envoys<span class="fn">b</span>  a great distance; </p><p class="indent"> you have descended even to Sheol itself.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>You are wearied by your many journeys, </p><p class="indent"> but you did not say, “There is no hope!” </p><p class="indent1"> You found renewal of your strength; </p><p class="indent"> therefore you did not grow weak.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>Whom have you dreaded and feared, </p><p class="indent"> so that you lied and failed </p><p class="indent"> to remember Me or take this to heart? </p><p class="indent1"> Is it not because I have long been silent </p><p class="indent"> that you do not fear Me?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>I will expose your righteousness and your works, </p><p class="indent"> and they will not profit you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>When you cry out, </p><p class="indent"> let your companies of idols deliver you! </p><p class="indent1"> Yet the wind will carry off all of them, </p><p class="indent"> a breath will take them away. </p><p class="indent1"> But he who seeks refuge in Me will inherit the land </p><p class="indent"> and possess My holy mountain.”
</p><p class="hdg">Healing for the Repentant</p><p class="reg1"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And it will be said, </p><p class="indent1stline">“Build it up, build it up, prepare the way, </p><p class="indent"> take every obstacle out of the way of My people.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>For thus says the One who is high and lifted up, </p><p class="indent"> who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I dwell in a high and holy place, </p><p class="indent"> and with the oppressed and humble in spirit, </p><p class="indent1"> to restore the spirit of the lowly </p><p class="indent"> and revive the heart of the contrite.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>For I will not accuse you forever, </p><p class="indent"> nor will I always be angry; </p><p class="indent1"> for then the spirit of man would grow weak before Me, </p><p class="indent"> with the breath of those I have made.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>I was enraged by his sinful greed, </p><p class="indent"> so I struck him and hid My face in anger; </p><p class="indent1"> yet he kept turning back </p><p class="indent"> to the desires of his heart.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>I have seen his ways, </p><p class="indent"> but I will heal him; </p><p class="indent1"> I will guide him and restore comfort </p><p class="indent"> to him and his mourners,

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>But the wicked are like the storm-tossed sea, </p><p class="indent"> for it cannot be still, </p><p class="indent"> and its waves churn up mire and muck.
