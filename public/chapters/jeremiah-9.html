<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Lament over Zion</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>Oh, that my head were a spring of water, </p><p class="indent"> and my eyes a fountain of tears! </p><p class="indent1"> I would weep day and night </p><p class="indent"> over the slain daughter of my people.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>If only I had a <span class='spell ca'>traveller</span><span class='spell gb'>traveller</span><span class='spell us'>traveler</span>’s lodge in the wilderness, </p><p class="indent"> I would abandon my people and depart from them, </p><p class="indent1"> for they are all adulterers, </p><p class="indent"> a crowd of faithless people.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>“They bend their tongues like bows; </p><p class="indent"> lies prevail over truth in the land. </p><p class="indent1"> For they proceed from evil to evil, </p><p class="indent"> and they do not take <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> into account,” </p><p class="selah"> declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“Let everyone guard against his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>; </p><p class="indent"> do not trust any brother, </p><p class="indent1"> for every brother deals craftily, </p><p class="indent"> and every friend spreads slander.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Each one betrays his friend; </p><p class="indent"> no one tells the truth. </p><p class="indent1"> They have taught their tongues to lie; </p><p class="indent"> they wear themselves out committing iniquity.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>You dwell<span class="fn">a</span>  in the midst of deception; </p><p class="indent"> in their deceit they refuse to know <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>,” </p><p class="selah"> declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Behold, I will refine them and test them, </p><p class="indent"> for what else can I do </p><p class="indent"> because of<span class="fn">b</span>  the daughter of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Their tongues are deadly arrows; </p><p class="indent"> they speak deception. </p><p class="indent1"> With his mouth a man speaks peace to his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>, </p><p class="indent"> but in his heart he sets a trap for him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Should I not punish them for these things? </p><p class="indent"> declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. </p><p class="indent1"> Should I not avenge <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span> </p><p class="indent"> on such a nation as this?”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>I will take up a weeping and wailing for the mountains, </p><p class="indent"> a dirge over the wilderness pasture, </p><p class="indent1"> for they have been scorched so no one passes through, </p><p class="indent"> and the lowing of cattle is not heard. </p><p class="indent1"> Both the birds of the air and the beasts have fled; </p><p class="indent"> they have gone away.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>“And I will make Jerusalem a heap of rubble, </p><p class="indent"> a haunt for jackals;<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, </p><p class="indent"> without inhabitant.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Who is the man wise enough to understand this? To whom has the mouth of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> spoken, that he may explain it? Why is the land destroyed and scorched like a desert, so no one can pass through it?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> answered, “It is because they have forsaken <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> law, which I set before them; they have not walked in it or obeyed <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> voice.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts and gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will feed this people wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink.
<span class="reftext">16</span>I will scatter them among the nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send a sword after them until I have finished them off.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Take note, and summon the wailing women; </p><p class="indent"> send for the most <span class='spell ca'>skilful</span><span class='spell gb'>skilful</span><span class='spell us'>skillful</span> among them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Let them come quickly </p><p class="indent"> and take up a lament over us, </p><p class="indent1"> that our eyes may overflow with tears, </p><p class="indent"> and our eyelids may gush with water.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>For the sound of wailing </p><p class="indent"> is heard from Zion: </p><p class="indent1">‘How devastated we are! </p><p class="indent"> How great is our shame! </p><p class="indent1"> For we have abandoned the land </p><p class="indent"> because our dwellings have been torn down.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>For death has climbed in through our windows; </p><p class="indent"> it has entered our fortresses </p><p class="indent1"> to cut off the children from the streets, </p><p class="indent"> the young men from the town squares.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Declare that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“The corpses of men will fall like dung </p><p class="indent"> upon the open field, </p><p class="indent1"> like newly cut grain behind the reaper, </p><p class="indent"> with no one to gather it.”
