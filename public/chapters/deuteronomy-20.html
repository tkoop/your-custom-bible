<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When you go out to war against your
enemies and see horses, chariots, and an army larger than yours, do
not be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, who brought you out of
the land of Egypt, is with you. When you are about to go into battle,
the priest is to come forward and address the army, saying to them,
“Hear, O Israel, today you are going into battle with your enemies.
Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not be alarmed or terrified
because of them. For the LORD your God goes with you to fight for you
against your enemies, to give you the victory.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Furthermore, the officers are to address
the army, saying, “Has any man built a new house and not dedicated
it? Let him return home, or he may die in battle and another man
dedicate it. Has any man planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy
its fruit? Let him return home, or he may die in battle and another
man enjoy its fruit. Has any man become pledged to a woman and not
married her? Let him return home, or he may die in battle and another
man marry her.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the officers shall speak further to
the army, saying, “Is any man afraid or fainthearted? Let him
return home, so that the hearts of his brothers will not melt like
his own.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the officers have finished addressing
the army, they are to appoint commanders to lead it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When you approach a city to fight against
it, you are to make an offer of peace. If they accept your offer of
peace and open their gates, all the people there will become forced
laborers to serve you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But if they refuse to make peace with you
and wage war against you, lay siege to that city. When the LORD your
God has delivered it into your hand, you must put every male to the
sword. But the women, children, livestock, and whatever else is in
the city—all its spoil—you may take as plunder, and you shall use
the spoil of your enemies that the LORD your God gives you. This is
how you are to treat all the cities that are far away from you and do
not belong to the nations nearby. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">However, in the cities of the nations that
the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, you must not leave
alive anything that breathes. For you must devote them to complete
destruction —the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites,
Hivites, and Jebusites—as the LORD your God has commanded you, so
that they cannot teach you to do all the detestable things they do
for their gods, and so cause you to sin against the LORD your God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When you lay siege to a city for an
extended time while fighting against it to capture it, you must not
destroy its trees by putting an axe to them, because you can eat
their fruit. You must not cut them down. Are the trees of the field
human, that you should besiege them? But you may destroy the trees
that you know do not produce fruit. Use them to build siege works
against the city that is waging war against you, until it falls. </font>
