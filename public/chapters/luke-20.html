<font face="Tahoma, serif">One day as Jesus was teaching the people
in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests
and scribes, together with the elders, came up to Him. “Tell us,”
they said, “by what authority are You doing these things, and who
gave You this authority?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will also ask
you a question,”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“Tell
Me: John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They deliberated among themselves and
said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why did you
not believe him?’ But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people
will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they answered that they did not know
where it was from. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Neither
will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then He proceeded to tell the people this
parable: <font color="#a80000">“A man planted a vineyard, rented it
out to some tenants, and went away for a long time. At harvest time,
he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of
the vineyard. But the tenants beat the servant and sent him away
empty-handed.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">So he sent another
servant, but they beat him and treated him shamefully, sending him
away empty-handed. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Then he sent a
third, but they wounded him and threw him out. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">What shall I do?’
asked the owner of the vineyard. ‘I will send my beloved son.
Perhaps they will respect him.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">But when the tenants
saw the son, they discussed it among themselves and said, ‘This is
the heir. Let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ So
they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">What then will the
owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and kill those
tenants, and will give the vineyard to others.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when the people heard this, they said,
“May such a thing never happen!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus looked directly at them and
said, <font color="#a80000">“Then what is the meaning of that which
is written:</font> </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">The stone the
builders rejected </font></font>

cornerstone’? </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Everyone who falls
on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will
be crushed.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the scribes and chief priests
realized that Jesus had spoken this parable against them, they sought
to arrest Him that very hour. But they were afraid of the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they watched Him closely and sent spies
who pretended to be sincere. They were hoping to catch Him in His
words in order to hand Him over to the rule and authority of the
governor. “Teacher,” they inquired, “we know that You speak and
teach correctly. You show no partiality, but teach the way of God in
accordance with the truth. Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar
or not?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus saw through their duplicity and
said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Show Me a denarius. Whose
image and inscription are on it?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Caesar’s,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“Give
to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And they were unable to trap Him in His
words before the people; and amazed at His answer, they fell silent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then some of the Sadducees, who say there
is no resurrection, came to question Him. “Teacher,” they said,
“Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a
wife but no children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and
raise up offspring for him. Now there were seven brothers. The first
one married a wife, but died childless. Then the second and the third
married the widow, and in the same way all seven died, leaving no
children. And last of all, the woman died. So then, in the
resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to
her.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“The
sons of this age marry and are given in marriage. But those who are
considered worthy to share in the age to come and in the resurrection
from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage. In fact,
they can no longer die, because they are like the angels. And since
they are sons of the resurrection, they are sons of God.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Even Moses
demonstrates that the dead are raised, in the passage about the
burning bush. For he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ He is not the God of the dead, but of
the living, for to Him all are alive.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher,
You have spoken well!” And they did not dare to question Him any
further. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus declared, <font color="#a80000">“How
can it be said that the Christ is the Son of David? For David himself
says in the book of Psalms:</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the hearing of all the people, Jesus
said to His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“Beware of the
scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, and they love the
greetings in the marketplaces, the chief seats in the synagogues, and
the places of honor at banquets. They defraud widows of their houses,
and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater
condemnation.”</font> </font>
