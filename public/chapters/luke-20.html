<span class="reftext">2</span>“Tell us,” they said, “by what authority are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> doing these things, and who gave <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> this authority?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span><span>“I will also ask <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> a question,”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“Tell <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>:
<span class="reftext">4</span>John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or from men?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>They deliberated among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will ask, ‘Why did <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not believe him?’
<span class="reftext">6</span>But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>So they answered that they did not know where it was from.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And Jesus replied, <span>“Neither will I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> by what authority I am doing these things.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Wicked Tenants<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 21:33–46; Mark 12:1–12)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> proceeded to tell the people this parable: <span>“A man planted a vineyard, rented it out to some tenants, and went away for a long time.
<span class="reftext">10</span>At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">11</span>So he sent another servant, but they beat him and treated him shamefully, sending him away empty-handed.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then he sent a third, but they wounded him and threw him out.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">13</span>‘What shall I do?’ asked the owner of the vineyard. ‘I will send my beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">14</span>But when the tenants saw the son, they discussed it among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’
<span class="reftext">15</span>So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. </p><p class="calibre3"> What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
<span class="reftext">16</span>He will come and kill those tenants, and will give the vineyard to others.” </p><p class="reg1"> And when the people heard this, they said, “May such a thing never happen!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>But Jesus looked directly at them and said, <span>“Then what is the meaning of that which is written:</span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘The stone the builders rejected </p><p class="indentred"> has become the cornerstone’<span class="fn">b</span>?
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">18</span>Everyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.”
</p><p class="hdg">Paying Taxes to Caesar<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 22:15–22; Mark 12:13–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>When the scribes and chief priests <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that Jesus had spoken this parable against them, they sought to arrest <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> that very hour. But they were afraid of the people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So they watched <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> closely and sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They were hoping to catch <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> words in order to hand <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> over to the rule and authority of the governor.
<span class="reftext">21</span>“Teacher,” they inquired, “we know that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> speak and teach correctly. You show no partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But Jesus saw through their duplicity and said to them,
<span><span class="reftext">24</span>“Show <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> a denarius.<span class="fn">c</span>  Whose image and inscription are on it?”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“Caesar’s,” they answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>So Jesus told them, <span>“Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>And they were unable to trap <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> words before the people; and amazed at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> answer, they fell silent.
</p><p class="hdg">The Sadducees and the Resurrection<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 22:23–33; Mark 12:18–27)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to question <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">28</span>“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man is to marry his brother’s widow and raise up offspring for him.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a wife, but died childless.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Then the second<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">31</span>and the third married the widow, and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children.
<span class="reftext">32</span>And last of all, the woman died.
<span class="reftext">33</span>So then, in the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For all seven were married to her.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus answered, <span>“The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.
<span class="reftext">35</span>But those who are considered worthy to share in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.
<span class="reftext">36</span>In fact, they can no longer die, because they are like the angels. And since they are sons of the resurrection, they are sons of God.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">37</span>Even Moses demonstrates that the dead are raised, in the passage about the burning bush. For he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">38</span>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> all are alive.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> have spoken well!”
<span class="reftext">40</span>And they did not dare to question <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> any further.
</p><p class="hdg">Whose Son Is the Christ?<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 22:41–46; Mark 12:35–37)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>Then Jesus declared, <span>“How can it be said that the Christ is the Son of David?
<span class="reftext">42</span>For David himself says in the book of Psalms:</span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘The Lord said to my Lord, </p><p class="indentred">“Sit at <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> right hand

</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">44</span>Thus David calls <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> ‘Lord.’ So how can <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> be David’s son?”
</p><p class="hdg">Beware of the Scribes<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 12:38–40)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>In the hearing of all the people, Jesus said to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples,
<span><span class="reftext">46</span>“Beware of the scribes. They like to walk around in long robes, and they love the greetings in the marketplaces, the chief seats in the synagogues, and the places of <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> at banquets.
<span class="reftext">47</span>They defraud widows of their houses,<span class="fn">h</span>  and for a show make lengthy prayers.
