<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Work Ridiculed</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now when Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he was furious and filled with indignation. He ridiculed the Jews
<span class="reftext">2</span>before his associates and the army of Samaria, saying, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Can they restore the wall by themselves?<span class="fn">a</span>  Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Can they bring these burnt stones back to life from the mounds of rubble?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside him, said, “If even a fox were to climb up on what they are building, it would break down their wall of stones!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Hear us, O God, for we are despised. Turn their scorn back upon their own heads, and let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Do not cover up their iniquity or let their sin be blotted out from Your sight, for they have provoked the builders.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So we rebuilt the wall until all of it was joined together up to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>When Sanballat and Tobiah, together with the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites, heard that the repair to the walls of Jerusalem was progressing and that the gaps were being closed, they were furious,
<span class="reftext">8</span>and all of them conspired to come and fight against Jerusalem and create a hindrance.
</p><p class="hdg">Discouragement Overcome</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So we prayed to our God and posted a guard against them day and night.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Meanwhile, the people of Judah said:<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent1stline">“The strength of the labourer fails, </p><p class="indent"> and there is so much rubble </p><p class="indent1"> that we will never be able </p><p class="indent"> to rebuild the wall.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And our enemies said, “Before they know or see a thing, we will come into their midst, kill them, and put an end to the work.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>At that time the Jews who lived nearby came and told us ten times over, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So I stationed men behind the lowest sections of the wall, at the vulnerable areas. I stationed them by families with their swords, spears, and bows.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>After I had made an inspection, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>When our enemies heard that we were aware of their scheme and that God had frustrated it, each of us returned to his own work on the wall.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And from that day on, half of my servants did the work while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armour. </p><p class="reg1"> The officers stationed themselves behind all the people of Judah
<span class="reftext">17</span>who were rebuilding the wall. The labourers who carried materials worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And each of the builders worked with his sword strapped at his side. But the trumpeter stayed beside me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people: “The work is great and extensive, and we are spread out far from one another along the wall.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Wherever you hear the sound of the horn, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>So we continued the work, while half of the men held spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out.
<span class="reftext">22</span>At that time I also said to the people, “Let every man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they can stand guard by night and work by day.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the guards with me changed out of our clothes; each carried his weapon, even to go for water.<span class="fn">d</span> </p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Will they commit themselves to God?</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">have provoked You to anger before the builders</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Meanwhile, Judah said</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">each carried his weapon in his right hand</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
