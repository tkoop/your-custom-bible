<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when Sanballat heard that we were
rebuilding the wall, he was furious and filled with indignation. He
ridiculed the Jews before his associates and the army of Samaria,
saying, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Can they restore the
wall by themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it
in a day? Can they bring these burnt stones back to life from the
mounds of rubble?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Tobiah the Ammonite, who was beside
him, said, “If even a fox were to climb up on what they are
building, it would break down their wall of stones!” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Hear us, O God, for we are despised. Turn
their scorn back upon their own heads, and let them be taken as
plunder to a land of captivity. Do not cover up their iniquity or let
their sin be blotted out from Your sight, for they have provoked the
builders. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So we rebuilt the wall until all of it was
joined together up to half its height, for the people had a mind to
work. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Sanballat and Tobiah, together with
the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites, heard that the repair to the
walls of Jerusalem was progressing and that the gaps were being
closed, they were furious, and all of them conspired to come and
fight against Jerusalem and create a hindrance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So we prayed to our God and posted a guard
against them day and night. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile, the people of Judah said: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">The strength of the laborer fails, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">and there is so much rubble </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">that we will never be able </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">to rebuild the wall.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And our enemies said, “Before they know
or see a thing, we will come into their midst, kill them, and put an
end to the work.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time the Jews who lived nearby
came and told us ten times over, “Wherever you turn, they will
attack us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I stationed men behind the lowest
sections of the wall, at the vulnerable areas. I stationed them by
families with their swords, spears, and bows. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After I had made an inspection, I stood up
and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people,
“Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and
awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters,
your wives and your homes.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When our enemies heard that we were aware
of their scheme and that God had frustrated it, each of us returned
to his own work on the wall. And from that day on, half of my
servants did the work while the other half held spears, shields,
bows, and armor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The officers stationed themselves behind
all the people of Judah who were rebuilding the wall. The laborers
who carried materials worked with one hand and held a weapon with the
other. And each of the builders worked with his sword strapped at his
side. But the trumpeter stayed beside me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I said to the nobles, the officials,
and the rest of the people: “The work is great and extensive, and
we are spread out far from one another along the wall. Wherever you
hear the sound of the horn, rally to us there. Our God will fight for
us!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So we continued the work, while half of
the men held spears from the break of dawn until the stars came out.
At that time I also said to the people, “Let every man and his
servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they can stand
guard by night and work by day.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So neither I nor my brothers nor my
servants nor the guards with me changed out of our clothes; each
carried his weapon, even to go for water. </font>
