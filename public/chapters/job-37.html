</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Listen closely to the thunder of His voice </p><p class="indent"> and the rumbling that comes from His mouth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>He unleashes His lightning beneath the whole sky </p><p class="indent"> and sends it to the ends of the earth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then there comes a roaring sound; </p><p class="indent"> He thunders with His majestic voice. </p><p class="indent1"> He does not restrain the lightning </p><p class="indent"> when His voice resounds.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>God thunders wondrously with His voice; </p><p class="indent"> He does great things we cannot comprehend.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ </p><p class="indent"> and to the gentle rain, ‘Pour out a mighty downpour.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>He seals up the hand of every man, </p><p class="indent"> so that all men may know His work.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>The wild animals enter their lairs; </p><p class="indent"> they settle down in their dens.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The tempest comes from its chamber, </p><p class="indent"> and the cold from the driving north winds.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>By the breath of God the ice is formed </p><p class="indent"> and the watery expanses are frozen.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>He loads the clouds with moisture; </p><p class="indent"> He scatters His lightning through them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>They swirl about, </p><p class="indent"> whirling at His direction, </p><p class="indent1"> accomplishing all that He commands </p><p class="indent"> over the face of all the earth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Whether for punishment or for His land, </p><p class="indent"> He accomplishes this in His loving devotion.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>Listen to this, O Job; </p><p class="indent"> stand still and consider the wonders of God.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Do you know how God dispatches the clouds </p><p class="indent"> or makes the lightning flash?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Do you understand how the clouds float, </p><p class="indent"> those wonders of Him who is perfect in knowledge?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>You whose clothes get hot </p><p class="indent"> when the land lies hushed under the south wind,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>can you, like Him, spread out the skies </p><p class="indent"> to reflect the heat like a mirror of bronze?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>Teach us what we should say to Him; </p><p class="indent"> we cannot draw up our case when our faces are in darkness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Should He be told that I want to speak? </p><p class="indent"> Would a man ask to be swallowed up<span class="fn">a</span>?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Now no one can gaze at the sun </p><p class="indent"> when it is bright in the skies </p><p class="indent"> after the wind has swept them clean.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Out of the north He comes in golden splendour; </p><p class="indent"> awesome majesty surrounds Him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>The Almighty is beyond our reach; </p><p class="indent"> He is exalted in power! </p><p class="indent1"> In His justice and great righteousness </p><p class="indent"> He does not oppress.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore, men fear Him, </p><p class="indent"> for He is not partial to the wise in heart.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">speak without being swallowed up</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
