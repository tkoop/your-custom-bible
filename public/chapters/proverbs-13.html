</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>From the fruit of his lips a man enjoys good things, </p><p class="indent"> but the desire of the faithless is violence.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>He who guards his mouth protects his life, </p><p class="indent"> but the one who opens his lips invites his own ruin.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>The slacker craves yet has nothing, </p><p class="indent"> but the soul of the diligent is fully satisfied.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>The righteous hate falsehood, </p><p class="indent"> but the wicked bring shame and disgrace.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Righteousness guards the man of integrity, </p><p class="indent"> but wickedness undermines the sinner.

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Arrogance leads only to strife, </p><p class="indent"> but wisdom is with the well-advised.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>Dishonest wealth will dwindle, </p><p class="indent"> but what is earned through hard work will be multiplied.
