<span class="reftext">2</span>at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and said to them, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> commanded through Moses that we be given cities in which to live, together with pasturelands for our livestock.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So by the command of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the Israelites gave the Levites these cities and their pasturelands out of their own inheritance:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>The first lot came out for the Kohathite clans. The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest received thirteen cities by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>The remaining descendants of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>The descendants of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>And the descendants of Merari received twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So the Israelites allotted to the Levites these cities, together with their pasturelands, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded through Moses.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>From the tribes of Judah and Simeon, they designated these cities by name
<span class="reftext">10</span>to the descendants of Aaron from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because the first lot fell to them:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>They gave them Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), with its surrounding pasturelands, in the hill country of Judah. (Arba was the father of Anak.)
<span class="reftext">12</span>But they had given the fields and villages around the city to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave these cities, together with their pasturelands: Hebron, a city of refuge for the manslayer, Libnah,
<span class="reftext">14</span>Jattir, Eshtemoa,
<span class="reftext">15</span>Holon, Debir,
<span class="reftext">16</span>Ain, Juttah, and Beth-shemesh—nine cities from these two tribes, together with their pasturelands.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>And from the tribe of Benjamin they gave them Gibeon, Geba,
<span class="reftext">18</span>Anathoth, and Almon—four cities, together with their pasturelands.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>In all, thirteen cities, together with their pasturelands, were given to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>The remaining Kohathite clans of the Levites were allotted these cities: </p><p class="list1stline"> From the tribe of Ephraim
<span class="reftext">21</span>they were given Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim (a city of refuge for the manslayer), Gezer,
<span class="reftext">22</span>Kibzaim, and Beth-horon—four cities, together with their pasturelands.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>From the tribe of Dan they were given Elteke, Gibbethon,
<span class="reftext">24</span>Aijalon, and Gath-rimmon—four cities, together with their pasturelands.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>And from the half-tribe of Manasseh they were given Taanach and Gath-rimmon—two cities, together with their pasturelands.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>In all, ten cities, together with their pasturelands, were given to the rest of the Kohathite clans.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>This is what the Levite clans of the Gershonites were given: </p><p class="list1stline"> From the half-tribe of Manasseh they were given Golan in Bashan, a city of refuge for the manslayer, and Beeshterah—two cities, together with their pasturelands.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">28</span>From the tribe of Issachar they were given Kishion, Daberath,
<span class="reftext">29</span>Jarmuth, and En-gannim—four cities, together with their pasturelands.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">30</span>From the tribe of Asher they were given Mishal, Abdon,

</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">32</span>And from the tribe of Naphtali they were given Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for the manslayer), Hammoth-dor, and Kartan—three cities, together with their pasturelands.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">33</span>In all, thirteen cities, together with their pasturelands, were given to the Gershonite clans.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>This is what the Merarite clan (the rest of the Levites) were given: </p><p class="list1stline"> From the tribe of Zebulun they were given Jokneam, Kartah,
<span class="reftext">35</span>Dimnah, and Nahalal—four cities, together with their pasturelands.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>For the Levites, then, there were forty-eight cities in all, together with their pasturelands, within the territory of the Israelites.
<span class="reftext">42</span>Each of these cities had its own surrounding pasturelands; this was true for all the cities.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>Thus <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gave Israel all the land <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had sworn to give their fathers, and they took possession of it and settled in it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gave them rest on every side, just as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had sworn to their fathers. None of their enemies could stand against them, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> delivered all their enemies into their hand.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>Not one of all <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s good promises to the house of Israel had failed; everything was fulfilled.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
