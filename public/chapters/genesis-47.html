<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jacob Settles in Goshen</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>So Joseph went and told Pharaoh: “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And he chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>“What is your occupation?” Pharaoh asked Joseph’s brothers. </p><p class="reg1">“Your servants are shepherds,” they replied, “both we and our fathers.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live in the land for a time, because there is no pasture for the flocks of your servants, since the famine in the land of Canaan has been severe. So now, please allow your servants to settle in the land of Goshen.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now that your father and brothers have come to you,
<span class="reftext">6</span>the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land. They may dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know of any talented men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>“How many years have you lived?” Pharaoh asked.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“My travels<span class="fn">a</span>  have lasted 130 years,” Jacob replied. “My years have been few and hard, and they have not matched the years of the travels of my fathers.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and departed from his presence.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So Joseph settled his father and brothers in the land of Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Joseph also provided his father and brothers and all his father’s household with food for their families.
</p><p class="hdg">The Famine Continues</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>There was no food, however, in all that region, because the famine was so severe; the lands of Egypt and Canaan had been exhausted by the famine.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Joseph collected all the money to be found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain they were buying, and he brought it into Pharaoh’s palace.
<span class="reftext">15</span>When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our funds have run out!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>“Then bring me your livestock,” said Joseph. “Since the money is gone, I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock.”
<span class="reftext">17</span>So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their flocks and herds, and their donkeys. Throughout that year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>When that year was over, they came to him the second year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord that our money is gone and all our livestock belongs to you. There is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Why should we perish before your eyes—we and our land as well? Purchase us and our land in exchange for food. Then we, along with our land, will be slaves to Pharaoh. Give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So Joseph acquired for Pharaoh all the land in Egypt; the Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields because the famine was so severe upon them. The land became Pharaoh’s,
<span class="reftext">21</span>and Joseph reduced the people to servitude<span class="fn">b</span>  from one end of Egypt to the other.
<span class="reftext">22</span>However, he did not acquire the priests’ portion of the land, for it had been given to them by Pharaoh. They ate the rations that Pharaoh supplied; so they did not sell their land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then Joseph said to the people, “Now that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh this day, here is seed for you to sow in the land.
<span class="reftext">24</span>At harvest time, you are to give a fifth of it to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be yours as seed for the field and food for yourselves and your households and children.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>“You have saved our lives,” they said. “We have found favour in our lord’s eyes, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”
<span class="reftext">26</span>So Joseph established a law that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh, and it is in effect in the land of Egypt to this day. Only the priests’ land does not belong to Pharaoh.
</p><p class="hdg">The Israelites Prosper in Goshen</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Now the Israelites settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and became fruitful and increased greatly in number.
<span class="reftext">28</span>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the length of his life was 147 years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favour in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise to show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,
<span class="reftext">30</span>but when I lie down with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me with them.” </p><p class="reg1"> Joseph answered, “I will do as you have requested.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>“Swear to me,” Jacob said. </p><p class="reg1"> So Joseph swore to him, and Israel bowed in worship at the head of his bed.<span class="fn">c</span> </p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">sojourns</i>; twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> SP, LXX, Vulgate; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">removed the people to the cities</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew; LXX <i class="calibre6">Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff</i>; see Hebrews 11:21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
