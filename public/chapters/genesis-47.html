<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Joseph went and told Pharaoh: “My
father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all they own,
have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And he chose five of his brothers and

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">What is your occupation?” Pharaoh
asked Joseph’s brothers. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Your servants are shepherds,” they
replied, “both we and our fathers.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come
to live in the land for a time, because there is no pasture for the
flocks of your servants, since the famine in the land of Canaan has
been severe. So now, please allow your servants to settle in the land
of Goshen.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now that your
father and brothers have come to you, the land of Egypt is before
you; settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land.
They may dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know of any talented
men among them, put them in charge of my own livestock.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob
and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">How many years have you lived?”
Pharaoh asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">My travels have lasted 130 years,”
Jacob replied. “My years have been few and hard, and they have not
matched the years of the travels of my fathers.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and departed
from his presence. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Joseph settled his father and brothers
in the land of Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the
land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. Joseph also
provided his father and brothers and all his father’s household
with food for their families. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">There was no food, however, in all that
region, because the famine was so severe; the lands of Egypt and
Canaan had been exhausted by the famine. Joseph collected all the
money to be found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan in
exchange for the grain they were buying, and he brought it into
Pharaoh’s palace. When the money from the lands of Egypt and Canaan
was gone, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food.
Why should we die before your eyes? For our funds have run out!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then bring me your livestock,” said
Joseph. “Since the money is gone, I will sell you food in exchange
for your livestock.” So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and
he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their flocks and
herds, and their donkeys. Throughout that year he provided them with
food in exchange for all their livestock. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When that year was over, they came to him
the second year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord that our
money is gone and all our livestock belongs to you. There is nothing
left for our lord except our bodies and our land. Why should we
perish before your eyes—we and our land as well? Purchase us and
our land in exchange for food. Then we, along with our land, will be
slaves to Pharaoh. Give us seed that we may live and not die, and
that the land may not become desolate.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Joseph acquired for Pharaoh all the
land in Egypt; the Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields because
the famine was so severe upon them. The land became Pharaoh’s, and
Joseph reduced the people to servitude from one end of Egypt to the
other. However, he did not acquire the priests’ portion of the
land, for it had been given to them by Pharaoh. They ate the rations
that Pharaoh supplied; so they did not sell their land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Joseph said to the people, “Now
that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh this day, here is
seed for you to sow in the land. At harvest time, you are to give a
fifth of it to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be yours as seed for the
field and food for yourselves and your households and children.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You have saved our lives,” they said.
“We have found favor in our lord’s eyes, and we will be Pharaoh’s
servants.” So Joseph established a law that a fifth of the produce
belongs to Pharaoh, and it is in effect in the land of Egypt to this
day. Only the priests’ land does not belong to Pharaoh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the Israelites settled in the land of
Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and
became fruitful and increased greatly in number. And Jacob lived in
the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the length of his life was 147
years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the time drew near for Israel to die,
he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If I have found favor in
your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise to show me
kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt, but when I lie
down with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me with them.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Joseph answered, “I will do as you have
requested.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Swear to me,” Jacob said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Joseph swore to him, and Israel bowed
in worship at the head of his bed. </font>
