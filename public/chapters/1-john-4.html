<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Testing the Spirits</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God. For many false prophets have gone out into the world.
<span class="reftext">2</span>By this <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will know the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and every spirit that does not confess Jesus<span class="fn">a</span>  is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have heard is coming and which is already in the world at this time.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span>, little children, are from God and have overcome them, because greater is <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> who is in <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> than he who is in the world.
<span class="reftext">5</span>They are of the world. That is why they speak from the world’s perspective, and the world listens to them.
<span class="reftext">6</span>We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. That is how we know the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span><span class="fn">b</span>  of truth and the spirit of deception.
</p><p class="hdg">Love Comes from God</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Beloved, let us love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>This is how God’s love was revealed among us: God sent <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> one and only<span class="fn">c</span>  <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> into the world, so that we might live through <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> loved us and sent <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> as the atoning sacrifice<span class="fn">d</span>  for our sins.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
<span class="reftext">12</span>No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God remains in us, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> love is perfected in us.
<span class="reftext">13</span>By this we know that we remain in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> in us: He has given us of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And we have seen and testify that the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> has sent <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> to be the <span class='spell ca'><span class='cap'>Saviour</span><span class='nocap'>saviour</span><span class='bsb'>Saviour</span></span><span class='spell gb'><span class='cap'>Saviour</span><span class='nocap'>saviour</span><span class='bsb'>Saviour</span></span><span class='spell us'><span class='cap'>Savior</span><span class='nocap'>savior</span><span class='bsb'>Savior</span></span> of the world.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>If anyone confesses that Jesus is the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of God, God abides in him, and he in God.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And we have come to know and believe the love that God has for us. God is love; whoever abides in love abides in God, and God in him.
<span class="reftext">17</span>In this way, love has been perfected among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span>; for in this world we are just like <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. The one who fears has not been perfected in love.
<span class="reftext">19</span>We love<span class="fn">e</span>  because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> first loved us.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>If anyone says, “I love God,” but hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.
