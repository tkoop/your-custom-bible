<font ><b>Testing the Spirits</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but
test the spirits to see whether they are from God. For many false
prophets have gone out into the world. By this you will know the
Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come
in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess
Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which
you have heard is coming and which is already in the world at this
time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You, little children, are from God and
have overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who
is in the world. They are of the world. That is why they speak from
the world’s perspective, and the world listens to them. We are from
God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does
not listen to us. That is how we know the Spirit of truth and the
spirit of deception. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Beloved, let us love one another, because
love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and
knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is
love. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is how God’s love was revealed
among us: God sent His one and only Son into the world, so that we
might live through Him. And love consists in this: not that we loved
God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as the atoning sacrifice
for our sins. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought
to love one another. No one has ever seen God; but if we love one
another, God remains in us, and His love is perfected in us. By this
we know that we remain in Him, and He in us: He has given us of His
Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent His Son
to be the Savior of the world. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If anyone confesses that Jesus is the Son
of God, God abides in him, and he in God. And we have come to know
and believe the love that God has for us. God is love; whoever abides
in love abides in God, and God in him. In this way, love has been
perfected among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of
judgment; for in this world we are just like Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There is no fear in love, but perfect love
drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. The one who fears
has not been perfected in love. We love because He first loved us. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If anyone says, “I love God,” but
hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his
brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. And
we have this commandment from Him: Whoever loves God must love his
brother as well. </font>
