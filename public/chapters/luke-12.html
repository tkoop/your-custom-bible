<font >In the meantime, a crowd of many thousands
had gathered, so that they were trampling one another. Jesus began to
speak first to His disciples: <font color="#a80000">“Beware of the
leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. There is nothing
concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will
not be made known. What you have spoken in the dark will be heard in
the daylight, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be
proclaimed from the housetops.</font> </font>

friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that
can do no more. But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear the
One who, after you have been killed, has authority to throw you into
hell. Yes, I tell you, fear Him! </font></font>

<font >Then He told them a parable: <font color="#a80000">“The
ground of a certain rich man produced an abundance. So he thought to
himself, ‘What shall I do, since I have nowhere to store my crops?’
Then he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns
and will build bigger ones, and there I will store up all my grain
and my goods. Then I will say to myself, “You have plenty of good
things laid up for many years. Take it easy. Eat, drink, and be
merry!”</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font color="#880000"> </font></font><font color="#a80000">’</font>

<font >Then Jesus said to His disciples,
<font color="#a80000">“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about
your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear.
For life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. Consider
the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storehouse or barn;
yet God feeds them. How much more valuable you are than the birds!</font>

lilies grow: They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even
Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these. If that is
how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and
tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, how much more will He clothe
you, O you of little faith! </font></font>

treasure is, there your heart will be also. </font></font>

service and keep your lamps burning. Then you will be like servants
waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that
when he comes and knocks, they can open the door for him at once.
Blessed are those servants whom the master finds on watch when he
returns. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve and will
have them recline at the table, and he himself will come and wait on
them. Even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night and
finds them alert, those servants will be blessed. </font></font>
