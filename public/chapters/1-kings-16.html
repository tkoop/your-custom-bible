<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jehu’s Prophecy against Baasha</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha, saying:
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Even though I lifted you out of the dust and made you ruler over <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people Israel, you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have caused <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people Israel to sin and to provoke <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> to anger by their sins.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So now I will consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city </p><p class="indent"> will be eaten by dogs, </p><p class="indent1"> and anyone who dies in the field </p><p class="indent"> will be eaten by the birds of the air.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>As for the rest of the acts of Baasha, along with his accomplishments and might, are they not written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span><span class='bsb'>Book</span> of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah, and his son Elah reigned in his place.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Moreover, the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, because of all the evil he had done in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, provoking <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> to anger with the work of his hands and becoming like the house of Jeroboam, and also because Baasha had struck down the house of Jeroboam.
</p><p class="hdg">Elah Reigns in Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>In the twenty-sixth year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>However, while Elah was in Tirzah getting drunk in the house of Arza the steward of his household there, Elah’s servant Zimri, the commander of half his chariots, conspired against him.
<span class="reftext">10</span>So in the twenty-seventh year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Zimri went in, struck Elah down, and killed him. And Zimri reigned in his place.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>As soon as Zimri began to reign and was seated on the throne, he struck down the entire household of Baasha. He did not leave a single male, whether a kinsman or friend.
<span class="reftext">12</span>So Zimri destroyed the entire household of Baasha, according to the word that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had spoken against Baasha through Jehu the prophet.
<span class="reftext">13</span>This happened because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit, provoking <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>As for the rest of the acts of Elah, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span><span class='bsb'>Book</span> of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
</p><p class="hdg">Zimri Reigns in Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Zimri reigned in Tirzah for seven days. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon of the Philistines,
<span class="reftext">16</span>and the people in the camp heard that Zimri had not only conspired but had also struck down the king. So there in the camp that very day, all Israel proclaimed Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then Omri and all the Israelites marched up from Gibbethon and besieged Tirzah.
<span class="reftext">18</span>When Zimri saw that the city was captured, he entered the citadel of the royal palace and burned it down upon himself. So he died
<span class="reftext">19</span>because of the sins he had committed, doing evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and following the example of Jeroboam and the sin he had committed and had caused Israel to commit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>As for the rest of the acts of Zimri and the treason he committed, are they not written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span><span class='bsb'>Book</span> of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
</p><p class="hdg">Omri Reigns in Israel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>At that time the people of Israel were divided: Half of the people supported Tibni son of Ginath as king, and half supported Omri.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But the followers of Omri proved stronger than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>In the thirty-first year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah.
<span class="reftext">24</span>He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver<span class="fn">a</span>  and built a city there, calling it Samaria after the name of Shemer, who had owned the hill.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>But Omri did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and acted more wickedly than all who were before him.
<span class="reftext">26</span>For he walked in all the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat and in his sins, which he caused Israel to commit, provoking <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, to anger with their worthless idols.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>As for the rest of the acts of Omri, along with his accomplishments and the might he exercised, are they not written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span><span class='bsb'>Book</span> of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>And Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and his son Ahab reigned in his place.
</p><p class="hdg">Ahab Reigns in Israel, Marries Jezebel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>In the thirty-eighth year of Asa’s reign over Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria twenty-two years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>However, Ahab son of Omri did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, more than all who were before him.
<span class="reftext">31</span>And as if it were not enough for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, he even married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and he then proceeded to serve and worship Baal.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>First, Ahab set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he had built in Samaria.
<span class="reftext">33</span>Then he set up an Asherah pole. Thus Ahab did more to provoke <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel before him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>In Ahab’s days, Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho. At the cost of Abiram his firstborn he laid its foundation, and at the cost of Segub his youngest he set up its gates, according to the word that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had spoken through Joshua son of Nun.<span class="fn">b</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">2 talents</i> is approximately 151 pounds or 68.4 kilograms of silver.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">34</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> See Joshua 6:26.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
