<font >While Jeremiah was still confined in the
courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him a second
time: “Thus says the LORD who made the earth, the LORD who formed
it and established it, the LORD is His name: Call to Me, and I will
answer and show you great and unsearchable things you do not know. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this is what the LORD, the God of
Israel, says about the houses of this city and the palaces of the
kings of Judah that have been torn down for defense against the siege
ramps and the sword: The Chaldeans are coming to fight and to fill
those places with the corpses of the men I will strike down in My
anger and in My wrath. I have hidden My face from this city because
of all its wickedness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, I will bring to it health
and healing, and I will heal its people and reveal to them the
abundance of peace and truth. I will restore Judah and Israel from
captivity and will rebuild them as in former times. And I will
cleanse them from all the iniquity they have committed against Me,
and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against Me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So this city will bring Me renown, joy,
praise, and glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear
of all the good I do for it. They will tremble in awe because of all
the goodness and prosperity that I will provide for it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the LORD says: In this place
you say is a wasteland without man or beast, in the cities of Judah
and in the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted—inhabited by
neither man nor beast—there will be heard again the sounds of joy
and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom, and the voices
of those bringing thank offerings into the house of the LORD, saying:
</font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Give thanks to the LORD of Hosts, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >for the LORD is good; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >His loving devotion endures forever.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For I will restore the land from captivity
as in former times, says the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the LORD of Hosts says: In
this desolate place, without man or beast, and in all its cities,
there will once more be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks.
In the cities of the hill country, the foothills, and the Negev, in
the land of Benjamin and the cities surrounding Jerusalem, and in the
cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of the
one who counts them, says the LORD. </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and Jerusalem will dwell securely, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and this is the name by which it will be
called: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >The LORD Our Righteousness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this is what the LORD says: David will
never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel, nor
will the priests who are Levites ever fail to have a man before Me to
offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to present
sacrifices.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:
“This is what the LORD says: If you can break My covenant with the
day and My covenant with the night, so that day and night cease to
occupy their appointed time, then My covenant may also be broken with
David My servant and with My ministers the Levites who are priests,
so that David will not have a son to reign on his throne. As the
hosts of heaven cannot be counted and as the sand on the seashore
cannot be measured, so too will I multiply the descendants of My
servant David and the Levites who minister before Me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, the word of the LORD came to
Jeremiah: “Have you not noticed what these people are saying: ‘The
LORD has rejected the two families He had chosen’? So they despise
My people and no longer regard them as a nation. This is what the
LORD says: If I have not established My covenant with the day and the
night and the fixed order of heaven and earth, then I would also
reject the descendants of Jacob and of My servant David, so as not to
take from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore them from captivity and will
have compassion on them.” </font>
