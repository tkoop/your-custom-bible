<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Excellence of the Restored Nation</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to him a second time:
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Thus says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> who made the earth,<span class="fn">a</span>  <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> who formed it and established it, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> name:
<span class="reftext">3</span>Call to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, and I will answer and show you great and unsearchable things <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not know.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says about the houses of this city and the palaces of the kings of Judah that have been torn down for <span class='spell ca'>defence</span><span class='spell gb'>defence</span><span class='spell us'>defense</span> against the siege ramps and the sword:
<span class="reftext">5</span>The Chaldeans are coming to fight<span class="fn">b</span>  and to fill those places with the corpses of the men I will strike down in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> anger and in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> wrath. I have hidden <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> face from this city because of all its wickedness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Nevertheless, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal its people and reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth.
<span class="reftext">7</span>I will restore Judah and Israel from captivity<span class="fn">c</span>  and will rebuild them as in former times.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And I will cleanse them from all the iniquity they have committed against <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So this city will bring <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> renown, joy, praise, and glory before all the nations of the earth, who will hear of all the good I do for it. They will tremble in awe because of all the goodness and prosperity that I will provide for it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: In this place <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> say is a wasteland without man or beast, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted—inhabited by neither man nor beast—there will be heard again
<span class="reftext">11</span>the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom, and the voices of those bringing thank offerings into the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Give thanks to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, </p><p class="indent"> for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is good; </p><p class="indent"> His loving devotion endures forever.’ </p><p class="reg1"> For I will restore the land from captivity<span class="fn">d</span>  as in former times, says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: In this desolate place, without man or beast, and in all its cities, there will once more be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks.
<span class="reftext">13</span>In the cities of the hill country, the foothills,<span class="fn">e</span>  and the Negev, in the land of Benjamin and the cities surrounding Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them, says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="hdg">The Covenant with David</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>Behold, the days are coming, </p><p class="indent"> declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, </p><p class="indent1"> when I will <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> the gracious promise </p><p class="indent"> that I have spoken </p><p class="indent1"> to the house of Israel </p><p class="indent"> and the house of Judah.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>In those days Judah will be saved, </p><p class="indent"> and Jerusalem will dwell securely, </p><p class="indent1"> and this is the name by which it will be called: </p><p class="indent"> <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> <span class='cap'>Our</span><span class='nocap'>our</span><span class='bsb'>Our</span> <span class='cap'>Righteousness</span><span class='nocap'>righteousness</span><span class='bsb'>Righteousness</span>.<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>For this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,
<span class="reftext">18</span>nor will the priests who are Levites ever fail to have a man before <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to present sacrifices.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Jeremiah:
<span class="reftext">20</span>“This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> can break <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> covenant with the day and <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> covenant with the night, so that day and night cease to occupy their appointed time,
<span class="reftext">21</span>then <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> covenant may also be broken with David <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> servant and with <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> ministers the Levites who are priests, so that David will not have a son to reign on his throne.
<span class="reftext">22</span>As the hosts of <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> cannot be counted and as the sand on the seashore cannot be measured, so too will I multiply the descendants of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> servant David and the Levites who minister before <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Moreover, the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Jeremiah:
<span class="reftext">24</span>“Have you not noticed what these people are saying: ‘<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> has rejected the two families <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had chosen’? So they despise <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people and no longer regard them as a nation.
<span class="reftext">25</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: If I have not established <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> covenant with the day and the night and the fixed order of <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> and <span class='nocap'>Earth</span><span class='cap'>Earth</span><span class='bsb'>earth</span>,
<span class="reftext">26</span>then I would also reject the descendants of Jacob and of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> servant David, so as not to take from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore them from captivity<span class="fn">g</span>  and will have compassion on them.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">who made it</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">They are coming to fight the Chaldeans</i>; that is, the Babylonians<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">restore the fortunes of the land</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Shephelah</i> or <i class="calibre6">lowlands</i>; that is, the western foothills of Judea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">YHWH Tsidqenu</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">restore their fortunes</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
