<font face="Tahoma, serif">While Jeremiah was still confined in the
courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him a second
time: “Thus says the LORD who made the earth, the LORD who formed
it and established it, the LORD is His name: Call to Me, and I will
answer and show you great and unsearchable things you do not know. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">For this is what the LORD, the God of
Israel, says about the houses of this city and the palaces of the
kings of Judah that have been torn down for defense against the siege
ramps and the sword: The Chaldeans are coming to fight and to fill
those places with the corpses of the men I will strike down in My
anger and in My wrath. I have hidden My face from this city because
of all its wickedness. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nevertheless, I will bring to it health
and healing, and I will heal its people and reveal to them the
abundance of peace and truth. I will restore Judah and Israel from
captivity and will rebuild them as in former times. And I will
cleanse them from all the iniquity they have committed against Me,
and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against Me. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">So this city will bring Me renown, joy,

David My servant and with My ministers the Levites who are priests,
so that David will not have a son to reign on his throne. As the
hosts of heaven cannot be counted and as the sand on the seashore
cannot be measured, so too will I multiply the descendants of My
servant David and the Levites who minister before Me.” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moreover, the word of the LORD came to
Jeremiah: “Have you not noticed what these people are saying: ‘The
LORD has rejected the two families He had chosen’? So they despise
My people and no longer regard them as a nation. This is what the
LORD says: If I have not established My covenant with the day and the
night and the fixed order of heaven and earth, then I would also
reject the descendants of Jacob and of My servant David, so as not to
take from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore them from captivity and will
have compassion on them.” </font>
