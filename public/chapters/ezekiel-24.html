<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Cooking Pot</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the ninth year, on the tenth day of the tenth month, the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Son of man, write down today’s date, for on this very day the king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Now speak a parable to this rebellious house and tell them that this is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Put the pot on the fire; </p><p class="indent"> put it on and pour in the water.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Put in the pieces of meat, </p><p class="indent"> every good piece—</p><p class="indent1"> thigh and shoulder—</p><p class="indent"> fill it with choice bones.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Take the choicest of the flock </p><p class="indent"> and pile the fuel beneath it. </p><p class="indent1"> Bring it to a boil </p><p class="indent"> and cook the bones in it.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Woe to the city of bloodshed, </p><p class="indent"> to the pot now rusted, </p><p class="indent"> whose rust will not come off! </p><p class="indent1"> Empty it piece by piece; </p><p class="indent"> cast no lots for its contents.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>For the blood she shed is still within her; </p><p class="indent"> she poured it out on the bare rock; </p><p class="indent1"> she did not pour it on the ground </p><p class="indent"> to cover it with dust.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>In order to stir up wrath </p><p class="indent"> and take vengeance, </p><p class="indent1"> I have placed her blood on the bare rock, </p><p class="indent"> so that it would not be covered.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Yes, this is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Woe to the city of bloodshed! </p><p class="indent"> I, too, will pile the kindling high.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Pile on the logs and kindle the fire; </p><p class="indent"> cook the meat well </p><p class="indent1"> and mix in the spices; </p><p class="indent"> let the bones be burned.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Set the empty pot on its coals </p><p class="indent"> until it becomes hot and its copper glows. </p><p class="indent1"> Then its impurity will melt within; </p><p class="indent"> its rust will be consumed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>It has frustrated every effort; </p><p class="indent"> its thick rust has not been removed, </p><p class="indent"> even by the fire.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Because of the indecency of your uncleanness </p><p class="indent"> I tried to cleanse you, </p><p class="indent1"> but you would not be purified </p><p class="indent"> from your filthiness. </p><p class="indent1"> You will not be pure again </p><p class="indent"> until My wrath against you has subsided.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have spoken; </p><p class="indent"> the time is coming, and I will act. </p><p class="indent1"> I will not refrain or show pity, </p><p class="indent"> nor will I relent. </p><p class="indent1"> I will judge you </p><p class="indent"> according to your ways and deeds,’ </p><p class="selah"> declares the Lord GOD.”
</p><p class="hdg">Ezekiel’s Wife Dies</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">16</span>“Son of man, behold, I am about to take away the desire of your eyes with a fatal blow. But you must not mourn or weep or let your tears flow.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Groan quietly; do not mourn for the dead. Put on your turban and strap your sandals on your feet; do not cover your lips or eat the bread of mourners.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. And the next morning I did as I had been commanded.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then the people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things you are doing mean to us?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So I answered them, “The word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying:
<span class="reftext">21</span>Tell the house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I am about to desecrate My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and the delight of your soul. And the sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then you will do as I have done: You will not cover your lips or eat the bread of mourners.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Your turbans will remain on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or weep, but you will waste away because of your sins, and you will groan among yourselves.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>‘Thus Ezekiel will be a sign for you; you will do everything that he has done. When this happens, you will know that I am the Lord GOD.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>And you, son of man, know that on the day I take away their stronghold, their pride and joy—the desire of their eyes which uplifted their souls—and their sons and daughters as well,
<span class="reftext">26</span>on that day a fugitive will come and tell you the news.
<span class="reftext">27</span>On that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped; you will speak and no longer be mute. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">let no lot fall upon it</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
