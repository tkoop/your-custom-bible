<span class="reftext">2</span>He cuts off every branch in <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> prunes to make it even more fruitful.
<span class="reftext">3</span>You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Remain in <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, and I will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">5</span>I am the vine and you are the branches. The one who remains in <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, and I in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> you can do nothing.
<span class="reftext">6</span>If anyone does not remain in <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned.
<span class="reftext">7</span>If you remain in <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
<span class="reftext">8</span>This is to <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>’s glory, that you bear much fruit, proving yourselves to be <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> disciples.

Remain in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> love.
<span class="reftext">10</span>If you keep <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> commandments, you will remain in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> love, just as I have kept <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>’s commandments and remain in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> love.
<span class="reftext">11</span>I have told you these things so that <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">12</span>This is <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">14</span>You are <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> friends if you do what I command you.
<span class="reftext">15</span>No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything I have learned from <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> I have made known to you.
<span class="reftext">16</span>You did not choose <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will remain—so that whatever you ask the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will give you.
<span class="reftext">17</span>This is <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> command to you: Love one another.

<span class="reftext">19</span>If you were of the world, it would love you as its own. Instead, the world hates you, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.

<span class="reftext">21</span>But they will treat you like this because of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name, since they do not know the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who sent <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
<span class="reftext">22</span>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin.

<span class="reftext">24</span>If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>.
