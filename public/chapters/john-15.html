<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jesus the True Vine<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 27:1–13)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">1</span>“I am the true vine, and My Father is the keeper of the vineyard.
<span class="reftext">2</span>He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes to make it even more fruitful.
<span class="reftext">3</span>You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">5</span>I am the vine and you are the branches. The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing.
<span class="reftext">6</span>If anyone does not remain in Me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned.
<span class="reftext">7</span>If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
<span class="reftext">8</span>This is to My Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, proving yourselves to be My disciples.
</p><p class="hdg">No Greater Love</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">9</span>As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Remain in My love.
<span class="reftext">10</span>If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and remain in His love.
<span class="reftext">11</span>I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">12</span>This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">14</span>You are My friends if you do what I command you.
<span class="reftext">15</span>No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you.
<span class="reftext">16</span>You did not choose Me, but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will remain—so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you.
<span class="reftext">17</span>This is My command to you: Love one another.
</p><p class="hdg">The Hatred of the World</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">18</span>If the world hates you, understand that it hated Me first.
<span class="reftext">19</span>If you were of the world, it would love you as its own. Instead, the world hates you, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">20</span>Remember the word that I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.’<span class="fn">a</span>  If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well; if they kept My word, they will keep yours as well.
<span class="reftext">21</span>But they will treat you like this because of My name, since they do not know the One who sent Me.
<span class="reftext">22</span>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">23</span>Whoever hates Me hates My Father as well.
<span class="reftext">24</span>If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father.
<span class="reftext">25</span>But this is to <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> what is written in their Law: ‘They hated Me without reason.’<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">26</span>When the Advocate<span class="fn">c</span>  comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—He will testify about Me.
<span class="reftext">27</span>And you also must testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> John 13:16<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> See Psalm 35:19, Psalm 38:19, and Psalm 69:4.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Comforter</i> or <i class="calibre6">Helper</i> or <i class="calibre6">Counselor</i>; Greek <i class="calibre6">Paraclete</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
