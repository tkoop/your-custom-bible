<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Timothy Joins Paul and Silas</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where he found a disciple named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewish woman and a Greek father.
<span class="reftext">2</span>The brothers in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, so he took him and circumcised him on account of the Jews in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>As they went from town to town, they delivered the decisions handed down by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey.
<span class="reftext">5</span>So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.

<span class="reftext">7</span>And when they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> of Jesus would not permit them.
<span class="reftext">8</span>So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>During the night, Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and pleading with him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”
<span class="reftext">10</span>As soon as Paul had seen the vision, we got ready to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
</p><p class="hdg">Lydia’s Conversion in Philippi<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Revelation 2:18–29)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>We sailed from Troas straight to Samothrace, and the following day on to Neapolis.
<span class="reftext">12</span>From there we went to the Roman colony of Philippi, the leading city of that district of Macedonia.<span class="fn">b</span>  And we stayed there several days.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate along the river, where it was customary to find a place of prayer. After sitting down, we spoke to the women who had gathered there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Among those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, “If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house.” And she persuaded us.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul and Silas Imprisoned</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>One day as we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl with a spirit of divination,<span class="fn">c</span>  who earned a large income for her masters by fortune-telling.
<span class="reftext">17</span>This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span><span class='bsb'>Most</span> <span class='cap'>High</span><span class='nocap'>high</span><span class='bsb'>High</span> God, who are proclaiming to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> the way of salvation!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>She continued this for many days. Eventually Paul grew so aggravated that he turned and said to the spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!” And the spirit left her at that very moment.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>When the girl’s owners saw that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the marketplace.
<span class="reftext">20</span>They brought them to the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews and are throwing our city into turmoil
<span class="reftext">21</span>by promoting customs that are unlawful for us Romans to adopt <span class='spell ca'>or practise</span><span class='spell gb'>or practise</span><span class='spell us'>or practice</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered that they be stripped and beaten with rods.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And after striking them with many blows, they threw them into prison and ordered the jailer to guard them securely.
<span class="reftext">24</span>On receiving this order, he placed them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
</p><p class="hdg">The Conversion of the Jailer</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Suddenly a strong earthquake shook the foundations of the prison. At once all the doors flew open and everyone’s chains came loose.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, presuming that the prisoners had escaped.
<span class="reftext">28</span>But Paul called out in a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself! We are all here!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Calling for lights, the jailer rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Then he brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household.”
<span class="reftext">32</span>Then Paul and Silas spoke the word of the Lord to him and to everyone in his house.
<span class="reftext">33</span>At that hour of the night, the jailer took them and washed their wounds. And without delay, he and all his household were baptized.
<span class="reftext">34</span>Then he brought them into his home and set a meal before them. So he and all his household rejoiced that they had come to believe in God.
</p><p class="hdg">An Official Apology</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>When daylight came, the magistrates sent their officers with the order: “Release those men.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>The jailer informed Paul: “The magistrates have sent orders to release <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. Now <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may go on your way in peace.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>But Paul said to the officers, “They beat us publicly without a trial and threw us into prison, even though we are Roman citizens. And now do they want to send us away secretly? Absolutely not! Let them come themselves and escort us out!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>So the officers relayed this message to the magistrates, who were alarmed to hear that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens.
<span class="reftext">39</span>They came to appease them and led them out, requesting that they leave the city.
<span class="reftext">40</span>After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house to see the brothers and encourage them. Then they left the city.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">in Asia</i>; Asia was a Roman province in what is now western Turkey. <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">we went to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia—a colony</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">a spirit of Python</i>; that is, a spirit of divination named after the mythical serpent slain by Apollo<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
