<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra,
where he found a disciple named Timothy, the son of a believing
Jewish woman and a Greek father. The brothers in Lystra and Iconium
spoke well of him. Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, so he took
him and circumcised him on account of the Jews in that area, for they
all knew that his father was a Greek. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As they went from town to town, they
delivered the decisions handed down by the apostles and elders in
Jerusalem for the people to obey. So the churches were strengthened
in the faith and grew daily in numbers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After the Holy Spirit had prevented them
from speaking the word in the province of Asia, they traveled through
the region of Phrygia and Galatia. And when they came to the border
of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would
not permit them. So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">During the night, Paul had a vision of a
man of Macedonia standing and pleading with him, “Come over to
Macedonia and help us.” As soon as Paul had seen the vision, we got
ready to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to
preach the gospel to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">We sailed from Troas straight to
Samothrace, and the following day on to Neapolis. From there we went
to the Roman colony of Philippi, the leading city of that district of
Macedonia. And we stayed there several days. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the Sabbath we went outside the city
gate along the river, where it was customary to find a place of
prayer. After sitting down, we spoke to the women who had gathered
there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Among those listening was a woman named
Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a
worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s
message. And when she and her household had been baptized, she urged
us, “If you consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my
house.” And she persuaded us. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">One day as we were going to the place of
prayer, we were met by a slave girl with a spirit of divination, who
earned a large income for her masters by fortune-telling. This girl
followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants
of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of
salvation!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">She continued this for many days.
Eventually Paul grew so aggravated that he turned and said to the
spirit, “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of
her!” And the spirit left her at that very moment. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the girl’s owners saw that their
hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged
them before the authorities in the marketplace. They brought them to
the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews and are throwing our
city into turmoil by promoting customs that are unlawful for us
Romans to adopt or practice.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The crowd joined in the attack against
Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered that they be stripped and
beaten with rods. And after striking them with many blows, they threw
them into prison and ordered the jailer to guard them securely. On
receiving this order, he placed them in the inner cell and fastened
their feet in the stocks. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">About midnight Paul and Silas were praying
and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to
them. Suddenly a strong earthquake shook the foundations of the
prison. At once all the doors flew open and everyone’s chains came
loose. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the jailer woke up and saw the prison
doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself,
presuming that the prisoners had escaped. But Paul called out in a
loud voice, “Do not harm yourself! We are all here!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Calling for lights, the jailer rushed in
and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. Then he brought them out
and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus
and you will be saved, you and your household.” Then Paul and Silas
spoke the word of the Lord to him and to everyone in his house. At
that hour of the night, the jailer took them and washed their wounds.
And without delay, he and all his household were baptized. Then he
brought them into his home and set a meal before them. So he and all
his household rejoiced that they had come to believe in God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When daylight came, the magistrates sent
their officers with the order: “Release those men.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The jailer informed Paul: “The
magistrates have sent orders to release you. Now you may go on your
way in peace.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Paul said to the officers, “They
beat us publicly without a trial and threw us into prison, even
though we are Roman citizens. And now do they want to send us away
secretly? Absolutely not! Let them come themselves and escort us
out!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the officers relayed this message to
the magistrates, who were alarmed to hear that Paul and Silas were
Roman citizens. They came to appease them and led them out,
requesting that they leave the city. After Paul and Silas came out of
the prison, they went to Lydia’s house to see the brothers and
encourage them. Then they left the city. </font>
