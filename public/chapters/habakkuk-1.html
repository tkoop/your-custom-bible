</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>How long, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, must I call for help </p><p class="indent"> but You do not hear, </p><p class="indent1"> or cry out to You, “Violence!” </p><p class="indent"> but You do not save?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Why do You make me see iniquity? </p><p class="indent"> Why do You tolerate wrongdoing? </p><p class="indent1"> Destruction and violence are before me. </p><p class="indent"> Strife is ongoing, and conflict abounds.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Therefore the law is paralyzed, </p><p class="indent"> and justice never goes forth. </p><p class="indent1"> For the wicked hem in the righteous, </p><p class="indent"> so that justice is perverted.
</p><p class="hdg"><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span>’s Answer</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>“Look at the nations and observe—</p><p class="indent"> be utterly astounded!<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> For I am doing a work in your days </p><p class="indent"> that you would never believe </p><p class="indent"> even if someone told you.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans<span class="fn">c</span> —</p><p class="indent"> that ruthless and impetuous nation </p><p class="indent1"> which marches through the breadth of the earth </p><p class="indent"> to seize dwellings not their own.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>They are dreaded and feared; </p><p class="indent"> from themselves they derive justice and sovereignty.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Their horses are swifter than leopards, </p><p class="indent"> fiercer than wolves of the night. </p><p class="indent1"> Their horsemen charge ahead, </p><p class="indent"> and their cavalry comes from afar. </p><p class="indent1"> They fly like a vulture, </p><p class="indent"> swooping down to devour.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>All of them come bent on violence; </p><p class="indent"> their hordes advance like the east wind; </p><p class="indent"> they gather prisoners like sand.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>They scoff at kings </p><p class="indent"> and make rulers an object of scorn. </p><p class="indent1"> They laugh at every fortress </p><p class="indent"> and build up siege ramps to seize it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then they sweep by like the wind </p><p class="indent"> and pass on through. </p><p class="indent1"> They are guilty; </p><p class="indent"> their own strength is their god.”
