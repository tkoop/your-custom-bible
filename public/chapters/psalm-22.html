</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>I cry out by day, O my God, </p><p class="indent"> but You do not answer, </p><p class="indent1"> and by night, </p><p class="indent"> but I have no rest.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>Yet You are holy, </p><p class="indent"> enthroned on the praises of Israel.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>In You our fathers trusted; </p><p class="indent"> they trusted and You delivered them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>They cried out to You and were set free; </p><p class="indent"> they trusted in You and were not disappointed.
