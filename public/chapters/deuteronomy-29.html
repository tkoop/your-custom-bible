<span class="reftext">3</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> saw with your own eyes the great trials, and those miraculous signs and wonders.

<span class="reftext">8</span>We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
<span class="reftext">9</span>So keep and follow the words of this covenant, that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may prosper in all <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I am making this covenant and this oath not only with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>,
<span class="reftext">15</span>but also with those who are standing here with us today in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God, as well as with those who are not here today.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> yourselves know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we passed through the nations on the way here.
<span class="reftext">17</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> saw the abominations and idols among them made of wood and stone, of silver and gold.

<span class="reftext">19</span>because when such a person hears the words of this oath,<span class="fn">d</span>  he invokes a blessing on himself, saying, ‘I will have peace, even though I walk in the stubbornness of my own heart.’ </p><p class="reg1"> This will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry.

<span class="reftext">21</span>and single him out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span><span class='bsb'>Book</span> of the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span><span class='bsb'>Law</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then the generation to come—<span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sons who follow <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and the foreigner who comes from a distant land—will see the plagues of the land and the sicknesses <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has inflicted on it.
<span class="reftext">23</span>All its soil will be a burning waste of <span class='spell ca'>sulphur</span><span class='spell gb'>sulphur</span><span class='spell us'>sulfur</span> and salt, unsown and unproductive, with no plant growing on it, just like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> overthrew in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> fierce anger.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So all the nations will ask, ‘Why has <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> done such a thing to this land? Why this great outburst of anger?’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>And the people will answer, ‘It is because they abandoned the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of their fathers, which <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> made with them when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> brought them out of the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">26</span>They went and served other gods, and they worshiped gods they had not known—gods that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had not given to them.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Therefore the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against this land, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> brought upon it every curse written in this book.
<span class="reftext">28</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> uprooted them from their land in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> anger, rage, and great wrath, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> cast them into another land, where they are today.’
