<font ><b>The Covenant in Moab</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These are the words of the covenant that
the LORD commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in the land of
Moab, in addition to the covenant He had made with them at Horeb. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses summoned all Israel and proclaimed
to them, “You have seen with your own eyes everything the LORD did
in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials, and to all his land. You
saw with your own eyes the great trials, and those miraculous signs
and wonders. Yet to this day the LORD has not given you a mind to
understand, eyes to see, or ears to hear. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >For forty years I led you in the
wilderness, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >yet your clothes and sandals did not wear
out. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >You ate no bread and drank no wine or
strong drink, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >so that you might know that I am the LORD
your God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When you reached this place, Sihon king of
Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out against us in battle, but we
defeated them. We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to
the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. So keep
and follow the words of this covenant, that you may prosper in all
you do. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All of you are standing today before the
LORD your God—you leaders of tribes, elders, officials, and all the
men of Israel, your children and wives, and the foreigners in your
camps who cut your wood and draw your water— so that you may enter
into the covenant of the LORD your God, which He is making with you
today, and into His oath, and so that He may establish you today as
His people, and He may be your God as He promised you and as He swore
to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I am making this covenant and this oath
not only with you, but also with those who are standing here with us
today in the presence of the LORD our God, as well as with those who
are not here today. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For you yourselves know how we lived in
the land of Egypt and how we passed through the nations on the way
here. You saw the abominations and idols among them made of wood and
stone, of silver and gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make sure there is no man or woman, clan
or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the LORD our God
to go and worship the gods of those nations. Make sure there is no
root among you that bears such poisonous and bitter fruit, because
when such a person hears the words of this oath, he invokes a
blessing on himself, saying, ‘I will have peace, even though I walk
in the stubbornness of my own heart.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This will bring disaster on the watered
land as well as the dry. The LORD will never be willing to forgive
him. Instead, His anger and jealousy will burn against that man, and
every curse written in this book will fall upon him. The LORD will
blot out his name from under heaven and single him out from all the
tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the
covenant written in this Book of the Law. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the generation to come—your sons
who follow you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land—will
see the plagues of the land and the sicknesses the LORD has inflicted
on it. All its soil will be a burning waste of sulfur and salt,
unsown and unproductive, with no plant growing on it, just like the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD
overthrew in His fierce anger. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So all the nations will ask, ‘Why has
the LORD done such a thing to this land? Why this great outburst of
anger?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the people will answer, ‘It is
because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their
fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land
of Egypt. They went and served other gods, and they worshiped gods
they had not known—gods that the LORD had not given to them.
Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against this land, and He
brought upon it every curse written in this book. The LORD uprooted
them from their land in His anger, rage, and great wrath, and He cast
them into another land, where they are today.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The secret things belong to the LORD our
God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children
forever, so that we may follow all the words of this law. </font>
