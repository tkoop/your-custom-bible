<span class="reftext">2</span>If your brother does not live near you, or if you do not know who he is, you are to take the animal home to remain with you until your brother comes seeking it; then you can return it to him.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And you shall do the same for his donkey, his cloak, or anything your brother has lost and you have found. You must not ignore it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>If you see your brother’s donkey or ox fallen on the road, you must not ignore it; you must help him lift it up.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>A woman must not wear men’s clothing, and a man must not wear women’s clothing, for whoever does these things is detestable to the LORD your God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>If you come across a bird’s nest with chicks or eggs, either in a tree or on the ground along the road, and the mother is sitting on the chicks or eggs, you must not take the mother along with the young.
<span class="reftext">7</span>You may take the young, but be sure to let the mother go, so that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>If you build a new house, you are to construct a railing around your roof, so that you do not bring bloodguilt on your house if someone falls from it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Do not plant your vineyard with two types of seed; if you do, the entire harvest will be defiled<span class="fn">b</span> —both the crop you plant and the fruit of your vineyard.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>You are to make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.
</p><p class="hdg">Marriage Violations</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Suppose a man marries a woman, has relations with her, and comes to hate her,
<span class="reftext">14</span>and he then accuses her of shameful conduct and gives her a bad name, saying, “I married this woman and had relations with her, but I discovered she was not a virgin.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then the young woman’s father and mother shall bring the proof of her virginity to the city elders at the gate
<span class="reftext">16</span>and say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he has come to hate her.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And now he has accused her of shameful conduct, saying, ‘I discovered that your daughter was not a virgin.’ But here is the proof of her virginity.” And they shall spread out the cloth before the city elders.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then the elders of that city shall take the man and punish him.
<span class="reftext">19</span>They are also to fine him a hundred shekels of silver<span class="fn">c</span>  and give them to the young woman’s father, because this man has given a virgin of Israel a bad name. And she shall remain his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>If, however, this accusation is true, and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found,
<span class="reftext">21</span>she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house, and there the men of her city will stone her to death. For she has committed an outrage in Israel by being promiscuous in her father’s house. So you must purge the evil from among you.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>If a man is found lying with another man’s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>If there is a virgin pledged in marriage to a man, and another man encounters her in the city and sleeps with her,
<span class="reftext">24</span>you must take both of them out to the gate of that city and stone them to death—the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he has violated his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>’s wife. So you must purge the evil from among you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>But if the man encounters a betrothed woman in the open country, and he overpowers her and lies with her, only the man who has done this must die.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Do nothing to the young woman, because she has committed no sin worthy of death. This case is just like one in which a man attacks his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> and murders him.
<span class="reftext">27</span>When he found her in the field, the betrothed woman cried out, but there was no one to save her.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>If a man encounters a virgin who is not pledged in marriage, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered,
<span class="reftext">29</span>then the man who lay with her must pay the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver,<span class="fn">e</span>  and she must become his wife because he has violated her. He must not divorce her as long as he lives.
