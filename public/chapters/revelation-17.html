<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then one of the seven angels with the
seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the
punishment of the great prostitute, who sits on many waters. The
kings of the earth were immoral with her, and those who dwell on the
earth were intoxicated with the wine of her immorality.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the angel carried me away in the
Spirit into a wilderness, where I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet
beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and
ten horns. The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and adorned
with gold and precious stones and pearls. She held in her hand a
golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual
immorality. And on her forehead a mysterious name was written: </font>
</p>
<p class="western" align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
<span style="text-transform: uppercase"><font >BABYLON
THE GREAT, <br/>
THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES <br/>
AND OF THE
ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</font></span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I could see that the woman was drunk with
the blood of the saints and witnesses for Jesus. And I was utterly
amazed at the sight of her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Why are you so amazed?” said the
angel. “I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast
that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The beast that you saw—it was, and now
is no more, but is about to come up out of the Abyss and go to its
destruction. And those who dwell on the earth whose names were not
written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will
marvel when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet will be.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This calls for a mind with wisdom. The
seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits. There are
also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet
come; but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The beast that was, and now is not, is an
eighth king, who belongs to the other seven and is going into
destruction. The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet
received a kingdom, but will receive one hour of authority as kings,
along with the beast. These kings have one purpose: to yield their
power and authority to the beast. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They will make war against the Lamb, and
the Lamb will triumph over them, because He is Lord of lords and King
of kings; and He will be accompanied by His called and chosen and
faithful ones.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the angel said to me, “The waters
you saw, where the prostitute was seated, are peoples and multitudes
and nations and tongues. And the ten horns and the beast that you saw
will hate the prostitute. They will leave her desolate and naked, and
will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. For God has put it into
their hearts to carry out His purpose by uniting to give their
kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled. And the
woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the
earth.” </font>
