<span class="reftext">10</span>On the Lord’s day I was in the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
<span class="reftext">11</span>saying,<span class="fn">e</span>  <span>“Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,

<span class="reftext">14</span>The hair of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> head was white like wool, as white as snow, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> eyes were like a blazing fire.
<span class="reftext">15</span>His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> voice was like the roar of many waters.
<span class="reftext">16</span>He held in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> right hand seven stars, and a sharp double-edged sword came from <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mouth. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.
