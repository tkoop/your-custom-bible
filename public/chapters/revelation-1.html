<font face="Tahoma, serif">I, John, your brother and partner in the
tribulation and kingdom and perseverance that are in Jesus, was on
the island of Patmos because of the word of God and my testimony
about Jesus. On the Lord’s day I was in the Spirit, and I heard
behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, saying, <font color="#a80000">“Write
on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to
Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and
Laodicea.”</font> </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I turned to see the voice that was
speaking with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,
and among the lampstands was One like the Son of Man, dressed in a
long robe, with a golden sash around His chest. The hair of His head
was white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes were like a
blazing fire. His feet were like polished bronze refined in a
furnace, and His voice was like the roar of many waters. He held in
His right hand seven stars, and a sharp double-edged sword came from
His mouth. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a
dead man. But He placed His right hand on me and said, <font color="#a80000">“Do
not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, the Living One. I was
dead, and behold, now I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the
keys of Death and of Hades.</font> </font>

the things you have seen, and the things that are, and the things
that will happen after this. This is the mystery of the seven stars
you saw in My right hand and of the seven golden lampstands: The
seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven
lampstands are the seven churches. </font></font>
