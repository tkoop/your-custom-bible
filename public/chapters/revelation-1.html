<font >This is the revelation of Jesus Christ,
which God gave Him to show His servants what must soon come to pass.
He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John, who
testifies to everything he saw. This is the word of God and the
testimony of Jesus Christ. </font>

<font >Grace and peace to you from Him who is and

from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead,

<font >To Him who loves us and has released us

<font >I, John, your brother and partner in the
tribulation and kingdom and perseverance that are in Jesus, was on
the island of Patmos because of the word of God and my testimony
about Jesus. On the Lord’s day I was in the Spirit, and I heard
behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, saying, <font color="#a80000">“Write
on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to
Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and
Laodicea.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I turned to see the voice that was
speaking with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,
and among the lampstands was One like the Son of Man, dressed in a
long robe, with a golden sash around His chest. The hair of His head
was white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes were like a
blazing fire. His feet were like polished bronze refined in a
furnace, and His voice was like the roar of many waters. He held in
His right hand seven stars, and a sharp double-edged sword came from
His mouth. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When I saw Him, I fell at His feet like a
dead man. But He placed His right hand on me and said, <font color="#a80000">“Do
not be afraid. I am the First and the Last, the Living One. I was
dead, and behold, now I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the
keys of Death and of Hades.</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Therefore write down
the things you have seen, and the things that are, and the things
that will happen after this. This is the mystery of the seven stars
you saw in My right hand and of the seven golden lampstands: The
seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven
lampstands are the seven churches. </font></font>
