<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Roles in Worship</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>You are to imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Now I commend you for remembering me in everything and for maintaining the traditions, just as I passed them on to you.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonours his head.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonours her head, for it is just as if her head were shaved.
<span class="reftext">6</span>If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off. And if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.
<span class="reftext">8</span>For man did not come from woman, but woman from man.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For this reason a woman ought to have a sign of authority on<span class="fn">a</span>  her head, because of the angels.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
<span class="reftext">12</span>For just as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
<span class="reftext">14</span>Doesn’t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,
<span class="reftext">15</span>but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.
<span class="reftext">16</span>If anyone is inclined to dispute this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.
</p><p class="hdg">Sharing in the Lord’s Supper<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:20–30; Mark 14:17–26; Luke 22:14–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>In the following instructions I have no praise to offer, because your gatherings do more harm than good.
<span class="reftext">18</span>First of all, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.
<span class="reftext">19</span>And indeed, there must be differences among you to show which of you are approved.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat.
<span class="reftext">21</span>For as you eat, each of you goes ahead without sharing his meal.<span class="fn">b</span>  While one remains hungry, another gets drunk.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Don’t you have your own homes in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What can I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? No, I will not!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread,
<span class="reftext">24</span>and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, <span>“This is My body, which is for you;<span class="fn">c</span>  do this in remembrance of Me.”</span>
<span class="reftext">25</span>In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, <span>“This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”</span>
<span class="reftext">26</span>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the<span class="fn">d</span>  body and blood of the Lord.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Each one must examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.
<span class="reftext">29</span>For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body<span class="fn">e</span>  eats and drinks judgment on himself.
<span class="reftext">30</span>That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Now if we judged ourselves properly, we would not come under judgment.
<span class="reftext">32</span>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>So, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
<span class="reftext">34</span>If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you come together it will not result in judgment. And when I come, I will give instructions about the remaining matters.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">have authority over</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">each one takes first his own meal.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">which is broken for you</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">will be responsible for the</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">29</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">the body of the Lord</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
