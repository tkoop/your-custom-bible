<font face="Tahoma, serif">You are to imitate me, just as I imitate
Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now I commend you for remembering me in
everything and for maintaining the traditions, just as I passed them
on to you. But I want you to understand that the head of every man is
Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is
God. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Every man who prays or prophesies with his
head covered dishonors his head. And every woman who prays or
prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for it is just
as if her head were shaved. If a woman does not cover her head, she
should have her hair cut off. And if it is shameful for a woman to
have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">A man ought not to cover his head, since
he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.
For man did not come from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man
created for woman, but woman for man. For this reason a woman ought
to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the Lord, however, woman is not
independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. For just as
woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything
comes from God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a
woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? Doesn’t nature itself
teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, but
that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is
given to her as a covering. If anyone is inclined to dispute this, we
have no other practice, nor do the churches of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the following instructions I have no
praise to offer, because your gatherings do more harm than good.
First of all, I hear that when you come together as a church, there
are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. And indeed, there
must be differences among you to show which of you are approved. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now then, when you come together, it is
not the Lord’s Supper you eat. For as you eat, each of you goes
ahead without sharing his meal. While one remains hungry, another
gets drunk. Don’t you have your own homes in which to eat and
drink? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who
have nothing? What can I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? No,
I will not! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For I received from the Lord what I also
passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took
bread, and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, <font color="#a80000">“This
is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”</font>
In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, <font color="#a80000">“This
cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink
it, in remembrance of Me.”</font> For as often as you eat this
bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He
comes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, whoever eats the bread or
drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of
sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. Each one must examine
himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For anyone
who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks
judgment on himself. That is why many among you are weak and sick,
and a number of you have fallen asleep. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now if we judged ourselves properly, we
would not come under judgment. But when we are judged by the Lord, we
are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the
world. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So, my brothers, when you come together to
eat, wait for one another. If anyone is hungry, he should eat at
home, so that when you come together it will not result in judgment.
And when I come, I will give instructions about the remaining
matters. </font>
