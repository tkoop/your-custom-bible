<span class="reftext">2</span>with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and with diligence to preserve the unity of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> through the bond of peace.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>There is one body and one <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, just as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were called to one hope when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were called;
<span class="reftext">5</span>one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
<span class="reftext">6</span>one God and <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now to each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
<span class="reftext">8</span>This is why it says:<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent1stline">“When <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> ascended on high, </p><p class="indent"> He led captives away, </p><p class="indent"> and gave gifts to men.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>What does “He ascended” mean, except that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> also descended<span class="fn">c</span>  to the lower parts of the earth?
<span class="reftext">10</span>He who descended is the very <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who ascended above all the heavens, in order to fill all things.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And it was <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,
<span class="reftext">12</span>to equip the saints for works of ministry and to build up the body of Christ,
<span class="reftext">13</span>until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span> of God, as we mature to the full measure of the stature of Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then we will no longer be infants, tossed about by the waves and carried around by every wind of teaching and by the clever cunning of men in their deceitful scheming.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Christ <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span>, who is the head.
<span class="reftext">16</span>From <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> the whole body, fitted and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love through the work of each individual part.
</p><p class="hdg">New Life in Christ <br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Colossians 3:1–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.
<span class="reftext">18</span>They are darkened in their understanding and alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardness of their hearts.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Having lost all sense of shame, they have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity, with a craving for more.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>But this is not the way <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> came to know Christ.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Surely <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> heard of <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and were taught in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>—in keeping with the truth that is in Jesus—
<span class="reftext">22</span>to put off <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> former way of life, your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;
<span class="reftext">23</span>to be renewed in the spirit of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> minds;
<span class="reftext">24</span>and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>, for we are all members of one another.
<span class="reftext">26</span>“Be angry, yet do not sin.”<span class="fn">d</span>  Do not let the sun set upon <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> anger,
<span class="reftext">27</span>and do not give the devil a foothold.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing good with his own hands, that he may have something to share with the one in need.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Let no unwholesome talk come out of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> mouths, but only what is helpful for building up the one in need and bringing grace to those who listen.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>And do not grieve the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of God, in whom <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were sealed for the day of redemption.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, outcry and slander, along with every form of malice.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Be kind and tenderhearted to one another, forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">He says</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Psalm 68:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">except that He also descended first</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">“In your anger do not sin.”</i> Psalm 4:4<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
