<font ><b>New Life in Christ </b></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As a prisoner in the Lord, then, I urge
you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling you have received: with
all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another
in love, and with diligence to preserve the unity of the Spirit
through the bond of peace. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There is one body and one Spirit, just as
you were called to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one
faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and
through all and in all. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now to each one of us grace has been given
according to the measure of the gift of Christ. This is why it says: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >When He ascended on high, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He led captives away, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and gave gifts to men.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >What does “He ascended” mean, except
that He also descended to the lower parts of the earth? He who
descended is the very One who ascended above all the heavens, in
order to fill all things. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And it was He who gave some to be
apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be
pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for works of ministry and
to build up the body of Christ, until we all reach unity in the faith
and in the knowledge of the Son of God, as we mature to the full
measure of the stature of Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then we will no longer be infants, tossed
about by the waves and carried around by every wind of teaching and
by the clever cunning of men in their deceitful scheming. Instead,
speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Christ
Himself, who is the head. From Him the whole body, fitted and held
together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in
love through the work of each individual part. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I tell you this, and insist on it in
the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the
futility of their thinking. They are darkened in their understanding
and alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is
in them due to the hardness of their hearts. Having lost all sense of
shame, they have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice
of every kind of impurity, with a craving for more. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But this is not the way you came to know
Christ. Surely you heard of Him and were taught in Him—in keeping
with the truth that is in Jesus— to put off your former way of
life, your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful
desires; to be renewed in the spirit of your minds; and to put on the
new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore each of you must put off
falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all
members of one another. “Be angry, yet do not sin.” Do not let
the sun set upon your anger, and do not give the devil a foothold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He who has been stealing must steal no
longer, but must work, doing good with his own hands, that he may
have something to share with the one in need. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Let no unwholesome talk come out of your
mouths, but only what is helpful for building up the one in need and
bringing grace to those who listen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger,
outcry and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and
tenderhearted to one another, forgiving each other just as in Christ
God forgave you. </font>
