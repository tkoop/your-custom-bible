<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Manasseh’s Western Inheritance</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now this was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph’s firstborn son, namely for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh and father of the Gileadites, who had received Gilead and Bashan because Machir was a man of war.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So this allotment was for the rest of the descendants of Manasseh—the clans of Abiezer,<span class="fn">a</span>  Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But Zelophehad son of Hepher (the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh) had no sons but only daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
<span class="reftext">4</span>They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, and said, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” </p><p class="reg1"> So Joshua gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers, in keeping with the command of the LORD.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Thus ten shares fell to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan,
<span class="reftext">6</span>because the daughters of Manasseh received an inheritance among his sons. And the land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now the border of Manasseh went from Asher to Michmethath near Shechem, then southward to include the inhabitants of En-tappuah.
<span class="reftext">8</span>The region of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah itself, on the border of Manasseh, belonged to Ephraim.
<span class="reftext">9</span>From there the border continued southward to the Brook of Kanah. There were cities belonging to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh, but the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook and ended at the Sea.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Ephraim’s territory was to the south, and Manasseh’s was to the north, having the Sea as its border and adjoining Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh was assigned Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor (that is, Naphath), Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo, each with their surrounding settlements.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But the descendants of Manasseh were unable to occupy these cities, because the Canaanites were determined to stay in this land.
<span class="reftext">13</span>However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they put the Canaanites to forced labour; but they failed to drive them out completely.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the sons of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you given us only one portion as an inheritance? We have many people, because the LORD has blessed us abundantly.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Joshua answered them, “If you have so many people that the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, go to the forest and clear for yourself an area in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>“The hill country is not enough for us,” they replied, “and all the Canaanites who live in the valley have iron chariots, both in Beth-shean with its towns and in the Valley of Jezreel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So Joshua said to the house of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—“You have many people and great strength. You shall not have just one allotment,
<span class="reftext">18</span>because the hill country will be yours as well. It is a forest; clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours. Although the Canaanites have iron chariots and although they are strong, you can drive them out.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Abiezer</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Iezer</i>; see Numbers 26:30.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, the Mediterranean Sea, also called the Great Sea; also in verse 10<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
