</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> afflicted the king with leprosy<span class="fn">b</span>  until the day he died, so that he lived in a separate house while his son Jotham had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.

<span class="reftext">9</span>And he did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, as his fathers had done. He did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah, struck him down and killed him in front of the people,<span class="fn">d</span>  and reigned in his place.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>As for the rest of the acts of Zechariah, they are indeed written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.

<span class="reftext">20</span>Menahem exacted this money from each of the wealthy men of Israel—fifty shekels of silver<span class="fn">h</span>  from each man—to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria withdrew and did not remain in the land.
