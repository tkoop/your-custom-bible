<font >In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam’s
reign over Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah became king of Judah. He
was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jecoliah; she was
from Jerusalem. And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD,
just as his father Amaziah had done. </font>

leprosy until the day he died, so that he lived in a separate house

of the land. </font>

<font >In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah’s
reign over Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel,

the LORD, as his fathers had done. He did not turn away from the sins
that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. </font>

his support and strengthen his own grip on the kingdom. Menahem
exacted this money from each of the wealthy men of Israel—fifty
shekels of silver from each man—to give to the king of Assyria. So
the king of Assyria withdrew and did not remain in the land. </font>
