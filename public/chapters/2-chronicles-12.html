<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Shishak Raids Jerusalem<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Kings 14:25–28)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After Rehoboam had established his sovereignty and royal power, he and all Israel<span class="fn">a</span>  with him forsook the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">2</span>In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign, because they had been unfaithful to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, Shishak king of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem
<span class="reftext">3</span>with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen,<span class="fn">b</span>  and countless troops who came with him out of Egypt—Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he said to them, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘You have forsaken <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>; therefore, I have forsaken you into the hand of Shishak.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> is righteous.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>When <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them, but will soon grant them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Nevertheless, they will become his servants, so that they may learn the difference between serving <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and serving the kings of other lands.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and seized the treasures of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields that Solomon had made.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place and committed them to the care of the captains of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And whenever the king entered the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the guards would go with him, bearing the shields, and later they would return them to the guardroom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> turned away from him, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> did not destroy him completely. Indeed, conditions were good in Judah.

He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had chosen from all the tribes of Israel in which to put <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> <span class='cap'>Name</span><span class='nocap'>name</span>. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And Rehoboam did evil because he did not set his heart to seek <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the <span class='cap'>Prophet</span><span class='nocap'>prophet</span> and of Iddo the <span class='cap'>Seer</span><span class='nocap'>seer</span> concerning the genealogies? There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their days.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the <span class='cap'>City</span><span class='nocap'>city</span> of David. And his son Abijah<span class="fn">d</span>  reigned in his place.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, Judah; in 2 Chronicles, Judah is occasionally called Israel, as representative of the true Israel.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">charioteers</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, people from the upper Nile region<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Abijah</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Abijam</i>; see 1 Kings 14:31.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
