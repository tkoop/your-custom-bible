<font ><b>Shishak Raids Jerusalem</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Rehoboam had established his
sovereignty and royal power, he and all Israel with him forsook the
Law of the LORD. In the fifth year of Rehoboam’s reign, because
they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt came up
and attacked Jerusalem with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen, and
countless troops who came with him out of Egypt—Libyans, Sukkites,
and Cushites. He captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as
far as Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam
and the leaders of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of
Shishak, and he said to them, “This is what the LORD says: ‘You
have forsaken Me; therefore, I have forsaken you into the hand of
Shishak.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the leaders of Israel and the king
humbled themselves and said, “The LORD is righteous.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the LORD saw that they had humbled
themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, “They
have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them, but will soon grant
them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem
through Shishak. Nevertheless, they will become his servants, so that
they may learn the difference between serving Me and serving the
kings of other lands.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So King Shishak of Egypt attacked
Jerusalem and seized the treasures of the house of the LORD and of
the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields that
Solomon had made. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in
their place and committed them to the care of the captains of the
guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. And whenever the
king entered the house of the LORD, the guards would go with him,
bearing the shields, and later they would return them to the
guardroom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the
anger of the LORD turned away from him, and He did not destroy him
completely. Indeed, conditions were good in Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus King Rehoboam established himself in
Jerusalem. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he
reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen
from all the tribes of Israel in which to put His Name. His mother’s
name was Naamah the Ammonite. And Rehoboam did evil because he did
not set his heart to seek the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to
last, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the Prophet and
of Iddo the Seer concerning the genealogies? There was war between
Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their days. And Rehoboam rested with
his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And his son Abijah
reigned in his place. </font>
