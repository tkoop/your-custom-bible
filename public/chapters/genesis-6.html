<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Corruption on the Earth<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 24:36–51)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born to them,
<span class="reftext">2</span>the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they took as wives whomever they chose.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So the LORD said, “My Spirit will not contend with man forever,<span class="fn">a</span>  for he is mortal; his days shall be 120 years.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and afterward as well—when the sons of God had relations with the daughters of men. And they bore them children who became the mighty men of old, men of renown.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was altogether evil all the time.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the LORD regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So the LORD said, “I will blot out man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—every man and beast and crawling creature and bird of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them.”
</p><p class="hdg">Noah’s Favor with God</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Noah, however, found favour in the eyes of the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and full of violence.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And God looked upon the earth and saw that it was corrupt; for all living creatures<span class="fn">b</span>  on the earth had corrupted their ways.
</p><p class="hdg">Preparing the Ark<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Hebrews 11:7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then God said to Noah, “The end of all living creatures has come before Me, because through them the earth is full of violence. Now behold, I will destroy both them and the earth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood;<span class="fn">c</span>  make rooms in the ark and coat it with pitch inside and out.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And this is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">16</span>You are to make a roof<span class="fn">e</span>  for the ark, finish its walls a cubit from the top,<span class="fn">f</span>  place a door in the side of the ark, and build lower, middle, and upper decks.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>And behold, I will bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy every creature under the heavens that has the breath of life. Everything on the earth will perish.
<span class="reftext">18</span>But I will establish My covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And you are to bring two of every living creature into the ark—male and female—to keep them alive with you.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Two of every kind of bird and animal and crawling creature will come to you to be kept alive.
<span class="reftext">21</span>You are also to take for yourself every kind of food that is eaten and gather it as food for yourselves and for the animals.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So Noah did everything precisely as God had commanded him.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX and Syriac <i class="calibre6">My Spirit will not remain in man forever</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">all flesh</i>; similarly in verses 13, 17, and 19<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Gopher</i> is an unknown kind of tree; possibly <i class="calibre6">cypress</i> or <i class="calibre6">cedar</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> The ark was approximately 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high (137.2 meters long, 22.9 meters wide, and 13.7 meters high).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">skylight</i> or <i class="calibre6">window</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">A cubit</i> is approximately 18 inches or 45.7 centimeters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
