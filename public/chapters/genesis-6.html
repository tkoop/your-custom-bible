<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when men began to multiply on the face
of the earth and daughters were born to them, the sons of God saw
that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they took as wives
whomever they chose. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the LORD said, “My Spirit will not
contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days shall be 120
years.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Nephilim were on the earth in those
days—and afterward as well—when the sons of God had relations
with the daughters of men. And they bore them children who became the
mighty men of old, men of renown. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of
man was great upon the earth, and that every inclination of the
thoughts of his heart was altogether evil all the time. And the LORD
regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in
His heart. So the LORD said, “I will blot out man, whom I have
created, from the face of the earth—every man and beast and
crawling creature and bird of the air—for I am grieved that I have
made them.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Noah, however, found favor in the eyes of
the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is the account of Noah. Noah was a
righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God. And
Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of
God, and full of violence. And God looked upon the earth and saw that
it was corrupt; for all living creatures on the earth had corrupted
their ways. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then God said to Noah, “The end of all
living creatures has come before Me, because through them the earth
is full of violence. Now behold, I will destroy both them and the
earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood;
make rooms in the ark and coat it with pitch inside and out. And this
is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 300 cubits long, 50
cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. You are to make a roof for the ark,
finish its walls a cubit from the top, place a door in the side of
the ark, and build lower, middle, and upper decks. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And behold, I will bring floodwaters upon
the earth to destroy every creature under the heavens that has the
breath of life. Everything on the earth will perish. But I will
establish My covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and
your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And you are to bring two of every living
creature into the ark—male and female—to keep them alive with
you. Two of every kind of bird and animal and crawling creature will
come to you to be kept alive. You are also to take for yourself every
kind of food that is eaten and gather it as food for yourselves and
for the animals.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Noah did everything precisely as God
had commanded him. </font>
