<font ><b>The Plague of Blood</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD answered Moses, “See, I have
made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your
prophet. You are to speak all that I command you, and your brother
Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and
though I will multiply My signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
Pharaoh will not listen to you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I will lay My hand on Egypt, and by
mighty acts of judgment I will bring the divisions of My people the
Israelites out of the land of Egypt. And the Egyptians will know that
I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand against Egypt and bring the
Israelites out from among them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD
had commanded them. Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was
eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “When
Pharaoh tells you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ you are to say to Aaron,
‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ and it will
become a serpent.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did
just as the LORD had commanded. Aaron threw his staff down before
Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a serpent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Pharaoh called the wise men and
sorcerers and magicians of Egypt, and they also did the same things
by their magic arts. Each one threw down his staff, and it became a
serpent. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up the other staffs. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Still, Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and
he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s
heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go. Go to Pharaoh
in the morning as you see him walking out to the water. Wait on the
bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that
was changed into a snake. Then say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of
the Hebrews, has sent me to tell you: Let My people go, so that they
may worship Me in the wilderness. But you have not listened until
now. This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the
LORD. Behold, with the staff in my hand I will strike the water of
the Nile, and it will turn to blood. The fish in the Nile will die,
the river will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink its
water.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron,
‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of
Egypt—over their rivers and canals and ponds and reservoirs—that
they may become blood.’ There will be blood throughout the land of
Egypt, even in the vessels of wood and stone.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had
commanded; in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials, Aaron raised
the staff and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was
turned to blood. The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so
bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. And there was blood
throughout the land of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the magicians of Egypt did the same
things by their magic arts. So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he
would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.
Instead, Pharaoh turned around, went into his palace, and did not
take any of this to heart. So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile
for water to drink, because they could not drink the water from the
river. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And seven full days passed after the LORD
had struck the Nile. </font>
