<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD answered Moses, “See, I have
made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your
prophet. You are to speak all that I command you, and your brother
Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his land. </font>

heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go. Go to Pharaoh
in the morning as you see him walking out to the water. Wait on the
bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that
was changed into a snake. Then say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of
the Hebrews, has sent me to tell you: Let My people go, so that they
may worship Me in the wilderness. But you have not listened until
now. This is what the LORD says: By this you will know that I am the
LORD. Behold, with the staff in my hand I will strike the water of
the Nile, and it will turn to blood. The fish in the Nile will die,
the river will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink its
water.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>

throughout the land of Egypt. </font>

take any of this to heart. So all the Egyptians dug around the Nile
for water to drink, because they could not drink the water from the
river. </font>
