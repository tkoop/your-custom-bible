They said to Jephthah, “Why have you crossed over to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We will burn your house down with you inside!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>But Jephthah replied, “My people and I had a serious conflict with the Ammonites, and when I called, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> did not save me out of their hands.
<span class="reftext">3</span>When I saw that you would not save me, I risked my life and crossed over to the Ammonites, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> delivered them into my hand. Why then have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> come today to fight against me?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Jephthah then gathered all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> Gileadites are fugitives in Ephraim, living in the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a fugitive from Ephraim would say, “Let me cross over,” the Gileadites would ask him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” </p><p class="reg1"> If he answered, “No,”
<span class="reftext">6</span>they told him, “Please say Shibboleth.” </p><p class="reg1"> If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce it correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. So at that time 42,000 Ephraimites were killed.
