<font ><b>Jephthah Defeats Ephraim</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the men of Ephraim assembled and
crossed the Jordan to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why have you
crossed over to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with
you? We will burn your house down with you inside!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jephthah replied, “My people and I
had a serious conflict with the Ammonites, and when I called, you did
not save me out of their hands. When I saw that you would not save
me, I risked my life and crossed over to the Ammonites, and the LORD
delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come today to fight
against me?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jephthah then gathered all the men of
Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck them
down because the Ephraimites had said, “You Gileadites are
fugitives in Ephraim, living in the territories of Ephraim and
Manasseh.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Gileadites captured the fords of the
Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a fugitive from Ephraim would
say, “Let me cross over,” the Gileadites would ask him, “Are
you an Ephraimite?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If he answered, “No,” they told him,
“Please say Shibboleth.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he
could not pronounce it correctly, they seized him and killed him at
the fords of the Jordan. So at that time 42,000 Ephraimites were
killed. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jephthah judged Israel six years, and when
he died, he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Jephthah, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged
Israel. He had thirty sons, as well as thirty daughters whom he gave
in marriage to men outside his clan; and for his sons he brought back
thirty wives from elsewhere. Ibzan judged Israel seven years. Then
Ibzan died, and he was buried in Bethlehem. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Ibzan, Elon the Zebulunite judged
Israel ten years. Then Elon the Zebulunite died, and he was buried in
Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Elon, Abdon son of Hillel, from
Pirathon, judged Israel. He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who
rode on seventy donkeys. And he judged Israel eight years. Then Abdon
son of Hillel, from Pirathon, died, and he was buried at Pirathon in
Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites. </font>
