<font >Then Moses said to the heads of the tribes
of Israel, “This is what the LORD has commanded: If a man makes a
vow to the LORD or swears an oath to obligate himself by a pledge, he
must not break his word; he must do everything he has promised. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And if a woman in her father’s house
during her youth makes a vow to the LORD or obligates herself by a
pledge, and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing
to her, then all the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself
shall stand. But if her father prohibits her on the day he hears
about it, then none of the vows or pledges by which she has bound
herself shall stand. The LORD will absolve her because her father has
prohibited her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >If a woman marries while under a vow or
rash promise by which she has bound herself, and her husband hears of
it but says nothing to her on that day, then the vows or pledges by
which she has bound herself shall stand. But if her husband prohibits
her when he hears of it, he nullifies the vow that binds her or the
rash promise she has made, and the LORD will absolve her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Every vow a widow or divorced woman
pledges to fulfill is binding on her. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >If a woman in her husband’s house has
made a vow or put herself under an obligation with an oath, and her
husband hears of it but says nothing to her and does not prohibit
her, then all the vows or pledges by which she has bound herself
shall stand. But if her husband nullifies them on the day he hears of
them, then nothing that came from her lips, whether her vows or
pledges, shall stand. Her husband has nullified them, and the LORD
will absolve her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Her husband may confirm or nullify any vow
or any sworn pledge to deny herself. But if her husband says nothing
to her from day to day, then he confirms all the vows and pledges
that bind her. He has confirmed them, because he said nothing to her
on the day he heard about them. But if he nullifies them after he
hears of them, then he will bear her iniquity.” </font>

commanded Moses concerning the relationship between a man and his
wife, and between a father and a young daughter still in his home. </font>
