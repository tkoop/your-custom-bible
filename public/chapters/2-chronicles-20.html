<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After this, the Moabites and Ammonites,
together with some of the Meunites, came to make war against
Jehoshaphat. Then some men came and told Jehoshaphat, “A vast army
is coming against you from Edom, from beyond the Sea; they are
already in Hazazon-tamar” (that is, En-gedi). </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jehoshaphat was alarmed and set his face
to seek the LORD. And he proclaimed a fast throughout Judah. So the
people of Judah gathered to seek the LORD, and indeed, they came from
all the cities of Judah to seek Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of
Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the LORD in front of the new
courtyard and said, “O LORD, God of our fathers, are You not the
God who is in heaven, and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of
the nations? Power and might are in Your hand, and no one can stand
against You. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Our God, did You not drive out the
inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and give it
forever to the descendants of Abraham Your friend? They have lived in
the land and have built in it a sanctuary for Your Name, saying, ‘If
disaster comes upon us—whether sword or judgment, plague or
famine—we will stand before this temple and before You, for Your
Name is in this temple. We will cry out to You in our distress, and
You will hear us and save us.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And now, here are the men of Ammon, Moab,
and Mount Seir, whom You did not let Israel invade when they came out
of the land of Egypt; but Israel turned away from them and did not
destroy them. See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out
of the possession that You gave us as an inheritance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Our God, will You not judge them? For we
are powerless before this vast army that comes against us. We do not
know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile all the men of Judah, with their
wives and children and little ones, were standing before the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon
Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the
son of Mattaniah, a Levite from Asaph’s descendants, as he stood in
the midst of the assembly. And he said, “Listen, all you people of
Judah and Jerusalem! Listen, King Jehoshaphat! This is what the LORD
says: ‘Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army,
for the battle does not belong to you, but to God. Tomorrow you are
to march down against them. You will see them coming up the Ascent of
Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley facing the
Wilderness of Jeruel. You need not fight this battle. Take up your
positions, stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD on your
behalf, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid or discouraged. Go
out and face them tomorrow, for the LORD is with you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jehoshaphat bowed facedown, and all
the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down before the LORD to
worship Him. And the Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood
up to praise the LORD, the God of Israel, shouting in a very loud
voice. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Early in the morning they got up and left
for the Wilderness of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood up
and said, “Hear me, O people of Judah and Jerusalem. Believe in the
LORD your God, and you will be upheld; believe in His prophets, and
you will succeed.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jehoshaphat consulted with the people
and appointed those who would sing to the LORD and praise the
splendor of His holiness. As they went out before the army, they were
singing: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Give thanks to the LORD, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">for His loving devotion endures forever.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The moment they began their shouts and
praises, the LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon, Moab, and
Mount Seir who had come against Judah, and they were defeated. The
Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir,
devoting them to destruction. And when they had made an end to the
inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the men of Judah came to a place
overlooking the wilderness, they looked for the vast army, but there
were only corpses lying on the ground; no one had escaped. Then
Jehoshaphat and his people went to carry off the plunder, and they
found on the bodies an abundance of goods and valuables —more than
they could carry away. They were gathering the plunder for three days
because there was so much. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the fourth day they assembled in the
Valley of Beracah, where they blessed the LORD. Therefore that place
is called the Valley of Beracah to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem,
with Jehoshaphat at their head, returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for
the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies. So they entered
Jerusalem and went into the house of the LORD with harps, lyres, and
trumpets. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the fear of God came upon all the
kingdoms of the lands when they heard that the LORD had fought
against the enemies of Israel. Then Jehoshaphat’s kingdom was at
peace, for his God had given him rest on every side. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was
thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in
Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter
of Shilhi. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Jehoshaphat walked in the way of his
father Asa and did not turn away from it; he did what was right in
the eyes of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The high places, however, were not
removed; the people had not yet set their hearts on the God of their
fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As for the rest of the acts of
Jehoshaphat, from beginning to end, they are indeed written in the
Chronicles of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the Book of
the Kings of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an
alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted wickedly. They agreed
to make ships to go to Tarshish, and these were built in Ezion-geber.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah
prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you have allied
yourself with Ahaziah, the LORD has destroyed your works.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the ships were wrecked and were unable
to sail to Tarshish. </font>
