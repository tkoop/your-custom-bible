<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Salvation Confirmed</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>We must pay closer attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every transgression and disobedience received its just punishment,
<span class="reftext">3</span>how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? </p><p class="reg1"> This salvation was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>,
<span class="reftext">4</span>and was affirmed by God through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> distributed according to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> will.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus like His Brothers</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>For it is not to angels that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But somewhere it is testified in these words: </p><p class="indent1stline">“What is man that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> are mindful of him, </p><p class="indent"> or the son of man that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> care for him?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>You made him a little lower<span class="fn">a</span>  than the angels; </p><p class="indent"> You crowned him with glory and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span><span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">8</span>and placed everything under his feet.”<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> When God subjected all things to him, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> left nothing outside of his control. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him.
<span class="reftext">9</span>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> suffered death, so that by the grace of God <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> might taste death for everyone.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting for God, for whom and through whom all things exist, to make the author<span class="fn">d</span>  of their salvation perfect through suffering.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For both the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.
<span class="reftext">12</span>He says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I will proclaim <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> name to <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> brothers; </p><p class="indent"> I will sing <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> praises in the assembly.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And again: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I will put <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> trust in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.”<span class="fn">f</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> And once again: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Here am I, and the children God has given <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.”<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Now since the children have flesh and blood, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> too shared in their humanity, so that by <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> death <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> might destroy him who holds the power of death, that is, the devil,
<span class="reftext">15</span>and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>For surely it is not the angels <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> helps, but the descendants of Abraham.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For this reason <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had to be made like <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> brothers in every way, so that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, in order to make atonement<span class="fn">h</span>  for the sins of the people.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> suffered when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was tempted, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is able to help those who are being tempted.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a little while lower</i>; also in verse 9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> WH and TR include <i class="calibre6">and set him over the works of Your hands</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Psalm 8:4–6 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">pioneer</i> or <i class="calibre6">founder</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Psalm 22:22 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Isaiah 8:17<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Isaiah 8:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">to make propitiation</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
