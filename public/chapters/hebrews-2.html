<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Salvation Confirmed</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>We must pay closer attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every transgression and disobedience received its just punishment,
<span class="reftext">3</span>how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? </p><p class="reg1"> This salvation was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard Him,
<span class="reftext">4</span>and was affirmed by God through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus like His Brothers</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>For it is not to angels that He has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But somewhere it is testified in these words: </p><p class="indent1stline">“What is man that You are mindful of him, </p><p class="indent"> or the son of man that You care for him?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>You made him a little lower<span class="fn">a</span>  than the angels; </p><p class="indent"> You crowned him with glory and honor<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">8</span>and placed everything under his feet.”<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> When God subjected all things to him, He left nothing outside of his control. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him.
<span class="reftext">9</span>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because He suffered death, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting for God, for whom and through whom all things exist, to make the author<span class="fn">d</span>  of their salvation perfect through suffering.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For both the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.
<span class="reftext">12</span>He says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I will proclaim Your name to My brothers; </p><p class="indent"> I will sing Your praises in the assembly.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And again: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I will put My trust in Him.”<span class="fn">f</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> And once again: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Here am I, and the children God has given Me.”<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Now since the children have flesh and blood, He too shared in their humanity, so that by His death He might destroy him who holds the power of death, that is, the devil,
<span class="reftext">15</span>and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>For surely it is not the angels He helps, but the descendants of Abraham.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For this reason He had to be made like His brothers in every way, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, in order to make atonement<span class="fn">h</span>  for the sins of the people.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Because He Himself suffered when He was tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a little while lower</i>; also in verse 9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> WH and TR include <i class="calibre6">and set him over the works of Your hands</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Psalm 8:4–6 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">pioneer</i> or <i class="calibre6">founder</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Psalm 22:22 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Isaiah 8:17<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Isaiah 8:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">to make propitiation</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
