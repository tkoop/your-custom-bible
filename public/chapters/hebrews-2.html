<font face="Tahoma, serif">We must pay closer attention, therefore,
to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. For if the
message spoken by angels was binding, and every transgression and
disobedience received its just punishment, how shall we escape if we
neglect such a great salvation? </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This salvation was first announced by the
Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard Him, and was affirmed by
God through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy
Spirit distributed according to His will. </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When God subjected all things to him, He
left nothing outside of his control. Yet at present we do not see
everything subject to him. But we see Jesus, who was made a little
lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because He
suffered death, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for
everyone. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In bringing many sons to glory, it was
fitting for God, for whom and through whom all things exist, to make
the author of their salvation perfect through suffering. For both the
One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are of the same
family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers. He says: </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">For surely it is not the angels He helps,
but the descendants of Abraham. For this reason He had to be made
like His brothers in every way, so that He might become a merciful

atonement for the sins of the people. Because He Himself suffered
when He was tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted. </font>
