<font ><b>The Mission of John the Baptist</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In those days John the Baptist came,
preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying, “Repent, for the
kingdom of heaven is near.” This is he who was spoken of through
the prophet Isaiah: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >A voice of one calling in the
wilderness, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Prepare the way for the Lord, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >make straight paths for Him.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >John wore a garment of camel’s hair,
with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild
honey. People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the
whole region around the Jordan. Confessing their sins, they were
baptized by him in the Jordan River. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when John saw many of the Pharisees
and Sadducees coming to his place of baptism, he said to them, “You
brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance. And do not presume
to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell
you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The axe lies ready at the root of the trees, and every tree that does
not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I baptize you with water for repentance,
but after me will come One more powerful than I, whose sandals I am
not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and
with fire. His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing
floor and to gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the
chaff with unquenchable fire.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Jesus came from Galilee to
the Jordan to be baptized by John. But John tried to prevent Him,
saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Let it be so
now,”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“It is fitting
for us to fulfill all righteousness in this way.”</font> Then John
permitted Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As soon as Jesus was baptized, He went up
out of the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened, and He saw the
Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting on Him. And a voice
from heaven said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleased!” </font>
