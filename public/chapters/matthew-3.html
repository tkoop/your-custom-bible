<span class="reftext">2</span>and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”
<span class="reftext">3</span>This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: </p><p class="indent1stline">“A voice of one calling in the wilderness, </p><p class="indent">‘Prepare the way for the Lord, </p><p class="indent"> make straight paths for Him.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>John wore a garment of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
<span class="reftext">5</span>People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region around the Jordan.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his place of baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
<span class="reftext">8</span>Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
<span class="reftext">10</span>The axe lies ready at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>I <span class='spell ca'>baptize</span><span class='spell gb'>baptise</span><span class='spell us'>baptize</span> you with water<span class="fn">b</span>  for repentance, but after me will come One more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will <span class='spell ca'>baptize</span><span class='spell gb'>baptise</span><span class='spell us'>baptize</span> you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">12</span>His winnowing fork is in His hand to clear His threshing floor and to gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Baptism of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 1:9–11; Luke 3:21–22; John 1:29–34)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and do You come to me?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">15</span>“Let it be so now,”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“It is fitting for us to <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> all righteousness in this way.”</span> Then John permitted Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>As soon as Jesus was baptized, He went up out of the water. Suddenly the heavens were opened,<span class="fn">d</span>  and He saw<span class="fn">e</span>  the Spirit of God descending like a dove and resting on Him.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And a voice from heaven said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased!”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Isaiah 40:3 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in water</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the Holy Spirit and in fire</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> NA, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">the heavens were opened to Him</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">and he saw</i>; see John 1:32–33.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
