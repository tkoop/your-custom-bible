“<font >Do for me as you did for my father
David when you sent him cedars to build himself a house to live in.
Behold, I am about to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God
to dedicate to Him for burning fragrant incense before Him, for
displaying the showbread continuously, and for making burnt offerings
every morning and evening as well as on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and
appointed feasts of the LORD our God. This is ordained for Israel
forever. </font>

<font >The house that I am building will be
great, for our God is greater than all gods. But who is able to build
a house for Him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot
contain Him? Who then am I, that I should build a house for Him,
except as a place to burn sacrifices before Him? </font>

<font >Send me, therefore, a craftsman skilled in
engraving to work with gold and silver, with bronze and iron, and
with purple, crimson, and blue yarn. He will work with my craftsmen
in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David provided. </font>

<font >Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum
logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants have skill to cut
timber there. And indeed, my servants will work with yours to prepare
for me timber in abundance, because the temple I am building will be
great and wonderful. I will pay your servants, the woodcutters,
20,000 cors of ground wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths of
wine, and 20,000 baths of olive oil.” </font>

the daughters of Dan, and his father is a man of Tyre. He is skilled
in work with gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood,
purple, blue, and crimson yarn, and fine linen. He is experienced in
every kind of engraving and can execute any design that is given him.

Lebanon, as many as you need, and we will float them to you as rafts
