<span class="reftext">2</span>So he conscripted 70,000 porters, 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 supervisors.

<span class="reftext">4</span>Behold, I am about to build a house for the Name of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> my God to dedicate to Him for burning fragrant incense before Him, for displaying the showbread continuously, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening as well as on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God. This is ordained for Israel forever.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>The house that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than all gods.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But who is able to build a house for Him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain Him? Who then am I, that I should build a house for Him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before Him?
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>Send me, therefore, a craftsman skilled in engraving to work with gold and silver, with bronze and iron, and with purple, crimson, and blue yarn. He will work with my craftsmen in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David provided.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Send me also cedar, cypress,<span class="fn">b</span>  and algum<span class="fn">c</span>  logs from Lebanon, for I know that your servants have skill to cut timber there. And indeed, my servants will work with yours
<span class="reftext">9</span>to prepare for me timber in abundance, because the temple I am building will be great and wonderful.
<span class="reftext">10</span>I will pay your servants, the woodcutters, 20,000 cors of ground wheat,<span class="fn">d</span>  20,000 cors of barley,<span class="fn">e</span>  20,000 baths of wine,<span class="fn">f</span>  and 20,000 baths of olive oil.<span class="fn">g</span>”

<span class="reftext">14</span>He is the son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, and his father is a man of Tyre. He is skilled in work with gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, purple, blue, and crimson yarn, and fine linen. He is experienced in every kind of engraving and can execute any design that is given him. He will work with your craftsmen and with those of my lord, your father David.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now let my lord send to his servants the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine he promised.
<span class="reftext">16</span>We will cut logs from Lebanon, as many as you need, and we will float them to you as rafts by sea down to Joppa. Then you can take them up to Jerusalem.”
