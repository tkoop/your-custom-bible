<font ><b>The Triumphal Entry</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus entered Jericho and was passing
through. And there was a man named Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector,
who was very wealthy. He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could
not see over the crowd because he was small in stature. So he ran on
ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Him, since Jesus was about
to pass that way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus came to that place, He looked
up and said, <font color="#a80000">“Zacchaeus, hurry down, for I
must stay at your house today.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Zacchaeus hurried down and welcomed Him
joyfully. And all who saw this began to grumble, saying, “He has
gone to be the guest of a sinful man!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the
Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I give to the poor, and
if I have cheated anyone, I will repay it fourfold.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus said to him, <font color="#a80000">“Today
salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of
Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While the people were listening to this,
Jesus proceeded to tell them a parable, because He was near Jerusalem
and they thought the kingdom of God would appear imminently. So He
said, <font color="#a80000">“A man of noble birth went to a distant
country to lay claim to his kingship and then return. Beforehand, he
called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Conduct
business with this until I return,’ he said.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But his subjects
hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, ‘We do not want
this man to rule over us.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >When he returned
from procuring his kingship, he summoned the servants to whom he had
given the money, to find out what each one had earned. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The first servant
came forward and said, ‘Master, your mina has produced ten more
minas.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >His master replied,
‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very
small matter, you shall have authority over ten cities.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The second servant
came and said, ‘Master, your mina has made five minas.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >And to this one he
said, ‘You shall have authority over five cities.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Then another servant
came and said, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I have laid away
in a piece of cloth. For I was afraid of you, because you are a harsh
man. You withdraw what you did not deposit and reap what you did not
sow.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >His master replied,
‘You wicked servant, I will judge you by your own words. So you
knew that I am a harsh man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and
reaping what I did not sow? Why then did you not deposit my money in
the bank, and upon my return I could have collected it with
interest?’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Then he told those
standing by, ‘Take the mina from him and give it to the one who has
ten minas.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Master,’ they
said, ‘he already has ten!’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >He replied, ‘I
tell you that everyone who has will be given more; but the one who
does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. And
these enemies of mine who were unwilling for me to rule over them,
bring them here and slay them in front of me.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Jesus had said this, He went on
ahead, going up to Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As He approached Bethphage and Bethany at
the Mount of Olives, He sent out two of His disciples, saying, <font color="#a80000">“Go
into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a
colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it
here. If anyone asks, ‘Why are you untying it?’ tell him, ‘The
Lord needs it.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font color="#880000"> </font></font><font color="#a80000">”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So those who were sent went out and found
it just as Jesus had told them. As they were untying the colt, its
owners asked, “Why are you untying the colt?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >The Lord needs it,” they answered.
Then they led the colt to Jesus, threw their cloaks over it, and put
Jesus on it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As He rode along, the people spread their
cloaks on the road. And as He approached the descent from the Mount
of Olives, the whole multitude of disciples began to praise God
joyfully in a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Blessed is the King who comes in the
name of the Lord!” </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Peace in heaven and glory in the
highest!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But some of the Pharisees in the crowd
said to Him, “Teacher, rebuke Your disciples!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >I tell you,”</font>
He answered, <font color="#a80000">“if they remain silent, the very
stones will cry out.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Jesus approached Jerusalem and saw the
city, He wept over it and said, <font color="#a80000">“If only you
had known on this day what would bring you peace! But now it is
hidden from your eyes. For the days will come upon you when your
enemies will barricade you and surround you and hem you in on every
side. They will level you to the ground—you and the children within
your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did
not recognize the time of your visitation from God.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus entered the temple courts and
began to drive out those who were selling there. He declared to them,
<font color="#a80000">“It is written: ‘My house will be a house
of prayer.’ But you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus was teaching at the temple every
day, but the chief priests, scribes, and leaders of the people were
intent on killing Him. Yet they could not find a way to do so,
because all the people hung on His words. </font>
