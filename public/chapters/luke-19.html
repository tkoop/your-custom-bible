<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus entered Jericho and was passing
through. And there was a man named Zacchaeus, a chief tax collector,
who was very wealthy. He was trying to see who Jesus was, but could
not see over the crowd because he was small in stature. So he ran on
ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Him, since Jesus was about
to pass that way. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jesus came to that place, He looked
up and said, <font color="#a80000">“Zacchaeus, hurry down, for I
must stay at your house today.”</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Zacchaeus hurried down and welcomed Him
joyfully. And all who saw this began to grumble, saying, “He has
gone to be the guest of a sinful man!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the
Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I give to the poor, and
if I have cheated anyone, I will repay it fourfold.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus said to him, <font color="#a80000">“Today
salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of
Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”</font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">While the people were listening to this,
Jesus proceeded to tell them a parable, because He was near Jerusalem
and they thought the kingdom of God would appear imminently. So He
said, <font color="#a80000">“A man of noble birth went to a distant
country to lay claim to his kingship and then return. Beforehand, he
called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. ‘Conduct
business with this until I return,’ he said.</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">When he returned
from procuring his kingship, he summoned the servants to whom he had
given the money, to find out what each one had earned. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">The first servant
came forward and said, ‘Master, your mina has produced ten more

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">His master replied,

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">The second servant

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Then another servant

sow.’ </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">His master replied,
‘You wicked servant, I will judge you by your own words. So you
knew that I am a harsh man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and
reaping what I did not sow? Why then did you not deposit my money in
the bank, and upon my return I could have collected it with
interest?’ </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Then he told those

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">He replied, ‘I
tell you that everyone who has will be given more; but the one who
does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. And
these enemies of mine who were unwilling for me to rule over them,
bring them here and slay them in front of me.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font face="Tahoma, serif"> </font></font><font face="Tahoma, serif">”

<font face="Tahoma, serif">After Jesus had said this, He went on
ahead, going up to Jerusalem. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As He approached Bethphage and Bethany at
the Mount of Olives, He sent out two of His disciples, saying, <font color="#a80000">“Go
into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a
colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it
here. If anyone asks, ‘Why are you untying it?’ tell him, ‘The
Lord needs it.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font color="#880000"> </font></font><font color="#a80000">”</font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">So those who were sent went out and found
it just as Jesus had told them. As they were untying the colt, its
owners asked, “Why are you untying the colt?” </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Lord needs it,” they answered.

Jesus on it. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">As He rode along, the people spread their
cloaks on the road. And as He approached the descent from the Mount

enemies will barricade you and surround you and hem you in on every

your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did
not recognize the time of your visitation from God.”</font> </font>
