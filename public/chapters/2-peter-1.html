<span class="reftext">13</span>I think it is right to refresh <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> memory as long as I live in the tent of my body,<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">14</span>because I know that this tent will soon be laid aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
