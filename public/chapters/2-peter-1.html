<font face="Tahoma, serif">To those who through the righteousness of
our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as
ours: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Grace and peace be multiplied to you
through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">His divine power has given us everything
we need for life and godliness through the knowledge of Him who
called us by His own glory and excellence. Through these He has given
us His precious and magnificent promises, so that through them you
may become partakers of the divine nature, now that you have escaped
the corruption in the world caused by evil desires. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For this very reason, make every effort to
add to your faith virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge,
self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance,
godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly
kindness, love. For if you possess these qualities and continue to
grow in them, they will keep you from being ineffective and
unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But whoever
lacks these traits is nearsighted to the point of blindness, having
forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, brothers, strive to make your
calling and election sure. For if you practice these things you will
never stumble, and you will receive a lavish reception into the
eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore I will always remind you of
these things, even though you know them and are established in the
truth you now have. I think it is right to refresh your memory as
long as I live in the tent of my body, because I know that this tent
will soon be laid aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to
me. And I will make every effort to ensure that after my departure,
you will be able to recall these things at all times. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For we did not follow cleverly devised
fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty. For He
received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to
Him from the Majestic Glory, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased.” And we ourselves heard this voice from
heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">We also have the word of the prophets as
confirmed beyond doubt. And you will do well to pay attention to it,
as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the
morning star rises in your hearts. Above all, you must understand
that no prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation.
For no such prophecy was ever brought forth by the will of man, but
men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. </font>
