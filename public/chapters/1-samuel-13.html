<font ><b>Saul’s Unlawful Sacrifice</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Saul was thirty years old when he became
king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years. He chose for
himself three thousand men of Israel: Two thousand were with Saul at
Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with
Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. And the rest of the troops he sent
away, each to his own home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jonathan attacked the Philistine
outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. So Saul blew the
ram’s horn throughout the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And all Israel heard the news: “Saul has
attacked an outpost of the Philistines, and now Israel has become a
stench to the Philistines!” Then the people were summoned to join
Saul at Gilgal. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Philistines assembled to fight
against Israel with three thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen,
and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and
camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Seeing that they were in danger because
their troops were hard-pressed, the men of Israel hid in caves and
thickets, among the rocks, and in cellars and cisterns. Some Hebrews
even crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul,
however, remained at Gilgal, and all his troops were quaking in fear.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Saul waited seven days for the time
appointed by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the
troops began to desert Saul. So he said, “Bring me the burnt
offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered up the burnt
offering. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Just as he finished offering the burnt
offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What have you done?” Samuel asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Saul replied, “When I saw that the
troops were deserting me, and that you did not come at the appointed
time and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash, I thought, ‘Now
the Philistines will descend upon me at Gilgal, and I have not sought
the favor of the LORD.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt
offering.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >You have acted foolishly,” Samuel
declared. “You have not kept the command that the LORD your God
gave you; if you had, the LORD would have established your kingdom
over Israel for all time. But now your kingdom will not endure; the
LORD has sought a man after His own heart and appointed him ruler
over His people, because you have not kept the command of the LORD.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Samuel set out from Gilgal and went
up to Gibeah in Benjamin. And Saul numbered the troops who were with
him, about six hundred men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Saul and Jonathan his son and the
troops with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, while the
Philistines camped at Michmash. And raiders went out of the
Philistine camp in three divisions. One headed toward Ophrah in the
land of Shual, another toward Beth-horon, and the third down the
border road overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the wilderness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And no blacksmith could be found in all
the land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “The Hebrews
must not be allowed to make swords or spears.” Instead, all the
Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen their
plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles. The charge was a pim for
sharpening a plowshare or mattock, a third of a shekel for sharpening
a pitchfork or an axe, and a third of a shekel for repointing an
oxgoad. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So on the day of battle not a sword or
spear could be found in the hands of the troops with Saul and
Jonathan; only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And a garrison of the Philistines had gone
out to the pass at Michmash. </font>
