<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">War with the Philistines</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Saul was thirty years old<span class="fn">a</span>  when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">2</span>He chose for himself three thousand men of Israel: Two thousand were with Saul at Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. And the rest of the troops he sent away, each to his own home.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. So Saul blew the ram’s horn throughout the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked an outpost of the Philistines, and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines!” Then the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now the Philistines assembled to fight against Israel with three thousand<span class="fn">c</span>  chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Seeing that they were in danger because their troops were hard-pressed, the men of Israel hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in cellars and cisterns.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul, however, remained at Gilgal, and all his troops were quaking in fear.
</p><p class="hdg">Saul’s Unlawful Sacrifice</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And Saul waited seven days for the time appointed by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the troops began to desert Saul.
<span class="reftext">9</span>So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered up the burnt offering.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Just as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>“What have you done?” Samuel asked. </p><p class="reg1"> And Saul replied, “When I saw that the troops were deserting me, and that you did not come at the appointed time and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash,
<span class="reftext">12</span>I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will descend upon me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>“You have acted foolishly,” Samuel declared. “You have not kept the command that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God gave you; if you had, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But now your kingdom will not endure; <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has sought a man after His own heart and appointed him ruler over His people, because you have not kept the command of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then Samuel set out from Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin.<span class="fn">d</span>  And Saul numbered the troops who were with him, about six hundred men.
</p><p class="hdg">Israel without Weapons</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Now Saul and Jonathan his son and the troops with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Michmash.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And raiders went out of the Philistine camp in three divisions. One headed toward Ophrah in the land of Shual,
<span class="reftext">18</span>another toward Beth-horon, and the third down the border road overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the wilderness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “The Hebrews must not be allowed to make swords or spears.”
<span class="reftext">20</span>Instead, all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>The charge was a pim<span class="fn">f</span>  for sharpening a plowshare or mattock, a third of a shekel for sharpening a pitchfork or an axe, and a third of a shekel for repointing an oxgoad.<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So on the day of battle not a sword or spear could be found in the hands of the troops with Saul and Jonathan; only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>And a garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Michmash.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> A few late LXX manuscripts; MT <i class="calibre6">Saul was a son of a year</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">over Israel forty years</i> (see Acts 13:21); MT <i class="calibre6">over Israel two years</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Some LXX manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">thirty thousand</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">Then Samuel set out, and the rest of the people went up after Saul to meet the army; they went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">and plowshares</i>; (so plowshare appears twice in the Hebrew).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">A pim</i> possibly refers to a polished stone weighing approximately 0.25 ounces or 7 grams found in excavations.
