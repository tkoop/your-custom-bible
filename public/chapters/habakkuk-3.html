</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, I have heard the report of You; </p><p class="indent"> I stand in awe, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, of Your deeds. </p><p class="indent1"> Revive them in these years; </p><p class="indent"> make them known in these years. </p><p class="indent"> In Your wrath, remember mercy!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>God came from Teman, </p><p class="indent"> and the Holy One from Mount Paran. </p><p class="selah"> Selah<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> His glory covered the heavens, </p><p class="indent"> and His praise filled the earth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>His radiance was like the sunlight; </p><p class="indent"> rays flashed from His hand, </p><p class="indent"> where His power is hidden.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Plague went before Him, </p><p class="indent"> and fever followed in His steps.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>He stood and measured the earth; </p><p class="indent"> He looked and startled the nations; </p><p class="indent1"> the ancient mountains crumbled; </p><p class="indent"> the perpetual hills collapsed. </p><p class="indent"> His ways are everlasting.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>I saw the tents of Cushan in distress; </p><p class="indent"> the curtains of Midian were trembling.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Were You angry at the rivers, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>? </p><p class="indent"> Was Your wrath against the streams? </p><p class="indent1"> Did You rage against the sea </p><p class="indent"> when You rode on Your horses, </p><p class="indent"> on Your chariots of salvation?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>You brandished Your bow; </p><p class="indent"> You called for many arrows. </p><p class="selah"> Selah </p><p class="indent"> You split the earth with rivers.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>The mountains saw You and quaked; </p><p class="indent"> torrents of water swept by. </p><p class="indent1"> The deep roared with its voice </p><p class="indent"> and lifted its hands on high.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Sun and moon stood still </p><p class="indent"> in their places </p><p class="indent1"> at the flash of Your flying arrows, </p><p class="indent"> at the brightness of Your shining spear.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>You marched across the earth with fury; </p><p class="indent"> You threshed the nations in wrath.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>You went forth for the salvation of Your people, </p><p class="indent"> to save Your anointed. </p><p class="indent1"> You crushed the head of the house of the wicked </p><p class="indent"> and stripped him from head to toe. </p><p class="selah"> Selah
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>With his own spear You pierced his head, </p><p class="indent"> when his warriors stormed out to scatter us, </p><p class="indent1"> gloating as though ready </p><p class="indent"> to secretly devour the weak.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>You trampled the sea with Your horses, </p><p class="indent"> churning the great waters.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>I heard and trembled within; </p><p class="indent"> my lips quivered at the sound. </p><p class="indent1"> Decay entered my bones; </p><p class="indent"> I trembled where I stood. </p><p class="indent1"> Yet I must wait patiently for the day of distress </p><p class="indent"> to come upon the people who invade us.
</p><p class="hdg">Habakkuk Rejoices</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>Though the fig tree does not bud </p><p class="indent"> and no fruit is on the vines, </p><p class="indent1"> though the olive crop fails </p><p class="indent"> and the fields produce no food, </p><p class="indent1"> though the sheep are cut off from the fold </p><p class="indent"> and no cattle are in the stalls,
