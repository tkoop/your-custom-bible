</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: </p><p class="tab1stline">‘The LORD, the God of heaven, who has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, has appointed me to build a house for Him at Jerusalem in Judah.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>Whoever among you belongs to His people, may his God be with him, and may he go to Jerusalem in Judah and build the house of the LORD, the God of Israel; He is the God who is in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And let every survivor, wherever he lives, be assisted by the men of that region with silver, gold, goods, and livestock, along with a freewill offering for the house of God in Jerusalem.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites—everyone whose spirit God had stirred—prepared to go up and rebuild the house of the LORD in Jerusalem.
