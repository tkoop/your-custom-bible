<font >These twelve Jesus sent out with the

road of the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans. Go rather
to the lost sheep of Israel. As you go, preach this message: ‘The
kingdom of heaven is near.’ Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse
the lepers, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.</font>

village you enter, find out who is worthy there and stay at his house
until you move on. As you enter the home, greet its occupants. If the
home is worthy, let your peace rest on it; but if it is not, let your
peace return to you. And if anyone will not welcome you or heed your
words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.
Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on
the day of judgment than for that town. </font></font>

to their councils and flog you in their synagogues. On My account,
you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them
and to the Gentiles. But when they hand you over, do not worry about
how to respond or what to say. In that hour you will be given what to
say. For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father
speaking through you. </font></font>
