</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>These are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
<span class="reftext">3</span>Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;

</p><p class="hdg">The Ministry of the Twelve<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 6:7–13; Luke 9:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: <span>“Do not go onto the road of the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.
<span class="reftext">7</span>As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.’
<span class="reftext">8</span>Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers,<span class="fn">c</span>  drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">9</span>Do not carry any gold or silver or copper in your belts.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Take no bag for the road, or second tunic, or sandals, or staff; for the worker is worthy of his provisions.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">11</span>Whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy there and stay at his house<span class="fn">d</span>  until you move on.
<span class="reftext">12</span>As you enter the home, greet its occupants.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">13</span>If the home is worthy, let your peace rest on it; but if it is not, let your peace return to you.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And if anyone will not welcome you or heed your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> than for that town.
</p><p class="hdg">Sheep among Wolves<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Timothy 1:3–12)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">16</span>Behold, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
<span class="reftext">17</span>But beware of men; for they will hand you over to their councils and flog you in their synagogues.
<span class="reftext">18</span>On My account, you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But when they hand you over, do not worry about how to respond or what to say. In that hour you will be given what to say.
<span class="reftext">20</span>For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">21</span>Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise against their parents and have them put to death.
<span class="reftext">22</span>You will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">23</span>When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. Truly I tell you, you will not reach all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">24</span>A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
<span class="reftext">25</span>It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul,<span class="fn">f</span>  how much more the members of his household!
</p><p class="hdg">Fear God Alone<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 12:4–7)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">26</span>So do not be afraid of them. For there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known.
<span class="reftext">27</span>What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the housetops.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">29</span>Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?<span class="fn">h</span>  Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.
<span class="reftext">30</span>And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
<span class="reftext">31</span>So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
</p><p class="hdg">Confessing Christ<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 12:8–12)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">32</span>Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father in heaven.
<span class="reftext">33</span>But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in heaven.
</p><p class="hdg">Not Peace but a Sword<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Micah 7:1–6; Luke 12:49–53)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">34</span>Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
<span class="reftext">35</span>For I have come to turn </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘a man against his father, </p><p class="indentred"> a daughter against her mother, </p><p class="indentred"> a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">36</span>A man’s enemies will be the members </p><p class="indentred">of his own household.’<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">37</span>Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me;
<span class="reftext">38</span>and anyone who does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.
<span class="reftext">39</span>Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.
</p><p class="hdg">The Reward of Service<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 4:8–17)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">40</span>He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me.
<span class="reftext">41</span>Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward.
<span class="reftext">42</span>And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is My disciple, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">Simon the Cananean</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the one also having betrayed Him</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> A <i class="calibre6">leper</i> was one afflicted with a skin disease.
