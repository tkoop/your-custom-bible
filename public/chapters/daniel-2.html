<font ><b>Nebuchadnezzar’s Troubling Dream</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the second year of his reign,
Nebuchadnezzar had dreams that troubled his spirit, and sleep escaped
him. So the king gave orders to summon the magicians, enchanters,
sorcerers, and astrologers to explain his dreams. When they came and
stood before the king, he said to them, “I have had a dream, and my
spirit is anxious to understand it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the astrologers answered the king in
Aramaic, “O king, may you live forever! Tell your servants the
dream, and we will give the interpretation.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The king replied to the astrologers, “My
word is final: If you do not tell me the dream and its
interpretation, you will be cut into pieces and your houses will be
reduced to rubble. But if you tell me the dream and its
interpretation, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great
honor. So tell me the dream and its interpretation.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They answered a second time, “Let the
king tell the dream to his servants, and we will give the
interpretation.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The king replied, “I know for sure that
you are stalling for time, because you see that my word is final. If
you do not tell me the dream, there is only one decree for you. You
have conspired to speak before me false and fraudulent words, hoping
the situation will change. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will
know that you can give me its interpretation.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The astrologers answered the king, “No
one on earth can do what the king requests! No king, however great
and powerful, has ever asked anything like this of any magician,
enchanter, or astrologer. What the king requests is so difficult that
no one can tell it to him except the gods, whose dwelling is not with
mortals.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This response made the king so furious
with anger that he gave orders to destroy all the wise men of
Babylon. So the decree went out that the wise men were to be
executed, and men went to look for Daniel and his friends to execute
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Arioch, the commander of the king’s
guard, had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon, Daniel
replied with discretion and tact. “Why is the decree from the king
so harsh?” he asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this time Arioch explained the
situation to Daniel. So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him
some time, so that he could give him the interpretation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Daniel returned to his house and
explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
urging them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this
mystery, so that Daniel and his friends would not be killed with the
rest of the wise men of Babylon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >During the night, the mystery was revealed
to Daniel in a vision, and he blessed the God of heaven and declared:
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Blessed be the name of God forever and
ever, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >for wisdom and power belong to Him. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He changes the times and seasons; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He removes kings and establishes them. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He gives wisdom to the wise </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and knowledge to the discerning. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He reveals the deep and hidden things; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >He knows what lies in darkness, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and light dwells with Him. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >To You, O God of my fathers, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I give thanks and praise, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >because You have given me </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >wisdom and power. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >And now You have made known to me </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >what we have requested, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >for You have made known to us </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >the dream of the king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore Daniel went to Arioch, whom the
king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon, and said to
him, “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon! Bring me before the
king, and I will give him the interpretation.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Arioch hastily brought Daniel before the
king and said to him, “I have found a man among the exiles from
Judah who will tell the king the interpretation.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The king responded to Daniel, whose name
was Belteshazzar, “Are you able to tell me what I saw in the dream,
as well as its interpretation?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Daniel answered the king, “No wise man,
enchanter, medium, or magician can explain to the king the mystery of
which he inquires. But there is a God in heaven who reveals
mysteries, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will
happen in the latter days. Your dream and the visions that came into
your mind as you lay on your bed were these: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As you lay on your bed, O king, your
thoughts turned to the future, and the Revealer of Mysteries made
known to you what will happen. And to me this mystery has been
revealed, not because I have more wisdom than any man alive, but in
order that the interpretation might be made known to the king, and
that you may understand the thoughts of your mind. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As you, O king, were watching, a great
statue appeared. A great and dazzling statue stood before you, and
its form was awesome. The head of the statue was pure gold, its chest
and arms were silver, its belly and thighs were bronze, its legs were
iron, and its feet were part iron and part clay. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As you watched, a stone was cut out, but
not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and
clay, and crushed them. Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold
were shattered and became like chaff on the threshing floor in
summer. The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be
found. But the stone that had struck the statue became a great
mountain and filled the whole earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This was the dream; now we will tell the
king its interpretation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You, O king, are the king of kings, to
whom the God of heaven has given sovereignty, power, strength, and
glory. Wherever the sons of men or beasts of the field or birds of
the air dwell, He has given them into your hand and has made you
ruler over them all. You are that head of gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But after you, there will arise another
kingdom, inferior to yours. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will
rule the whole earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom as
strong as iron; for iron shatters and crushes all things, and like
iron that crushes all things, it will shatter and crush all the
others. And just as you saw that the feet and toes were made partly
of fired clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom,
yet some of the strength of iron will be in it—just as you saw the
iron mixed with clay. And as the toes of the feet were partly iron
and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly
brittle. As you saw the iron mixed with clay, so the peoples will mix
with one another, but will not hold together any more than iron mixes
with clay. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the days of those kings, the God of
heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will
it be left to another people. It will shatter all these kingdoms and
bring them to an end, but will itself stand forever. And just as you
saw a stone being cut out of the mountain without human hands, and it
shattered the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold, so the great God
has told the king what will happen in the future. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The dream is true, and its interpretation
is trustworthy.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his
face, paid homage to Daniel, and ordered that an offering of incense
be presented to him. The king said to Daniel, “Your God is truly
the God of gods and Lord of kings, the Revealer of Mysteries, since
you were able to reveal this mystery.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him
many generous gifts. He made him ruler over the entire province of
Babylon and chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon. And
at Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego to manage the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained in
the king’s court. </font>
