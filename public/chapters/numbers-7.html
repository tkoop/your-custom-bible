<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the day Moses finished setting up the
tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings,
along with the altar and all its utensils. And the leaders of Israel,
the heads of their families, presented an offering. These men were
the tribal leaders who had supervised the registration. They brought
as their offering before the LORD six covered carts and twelve
oxen—an ox from each leader and a cart from every two leaders—and
presented them before the tabernacle. </font>

eight oxen, as their service required, all under the direction of
Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. But he did not give any to the
Kohathites, since they were to carry on their shoulders the holy
objects for which they were responsible. </font>
