<font >When Jesus had spoken these things, He
lifted up His eyes to heaven and said, <font color="#a80000">“Father,
the hour has come. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son may glorify You.
For You granted Him authority over all people, so that He may give
eternal life to all those You have given Him. Now this is eternal
life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ,
whom You have sent. I have glorified You on earth by accomplishing
the work You gave Me to do. And now, Father, glorify Me in Your
presence with the glory I had with You before the world existed.</font>

name to those You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours;
You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word. Now they know that
everything You have given Me comes from You. For I have given them
the words You gave Me, and they have received them. They knew with
certainty that I came from You, and they believed that You sent Me. </font></font>

behalf. I do not ask on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those
You have given Me; for they are Yours. All I have is Yours, and all
You have is Mine; and in them I have been glorified. I will no longer
be in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to You. </font></font>

them by Your name, the name You gave Me, so that they may be one as
We are one. While I was with them, I protected and preserved them by
Your name, the name You gave Me. Not one of them has been lost,

fulfilled. </font></font>

the world, I have also sent them into the world. For them I sanctify
Myself, so that they too may be sanctified by the truth. </font></font>
