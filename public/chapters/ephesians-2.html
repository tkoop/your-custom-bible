<font ><b>Christ Our Cornerstone</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you were dead in your trespasses and
sins, in which you used to walk when you conformed to the ways of
this world and of the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit who
is now at work in the sons of disobedience. All of us also lived
among them at one time, fulfilling the cravings of our flesh and
indulging its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature
children of wrath. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But because of His great love for us, God,
who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were
dead in our trespasses. It is by grace you have been saved! And God
raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly
realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages He might
display the surpassing riches of His grace, demonstrated by His
kindness to us in Christ Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For it is by grace you have been saved
through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God,
not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God
prepared in advance as our way of life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore remember that formerly you who
are Gentiles in the flesh and called uncircumcised by the so-called
circumcision (that done in the body by human hands)— remember that
at that time you were separate from Christ, alienated from the
commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the
promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ
Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the
blood of Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For He Himself is our peace, who has made
the two one and has torn down the dividing wall of hostility by
abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments and decrees. He did
this to create in Himself one new man out of the two, thus making
peace and reconciling both of them to God in one body through the
cross, by which He extinguished their hostility. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He came and preached peace to you who were
far away and peace to those who were near. For through Him we both
have access to the Father by one Spirit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore you are no longer strangers and
foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God’s
household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with
Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone. In Him the whole building is
fitted together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord. And in Him
you too are being built together into a dwelling place for God in His
Spirit. </font>
