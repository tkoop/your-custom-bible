<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Alive with Christ<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Colossians 2:6–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,
<span class="reftext">2</span>in which you used to walk when you conformed to the ways of this world and of the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit who is now at work in the sons of disobedience.
<span class="reftext">3</span>All of us also lived among them at one time, fulfilling the cravings of our flesh and indulging its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature children of wrath.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But because of His great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,
<span class="reftext">5</span>made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in our trespasses. It is by grace you have been saved!
<span class="reftext">6</span>And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,
<span class="reftext">7</span>in order that in the coming ages He might display the surpassing riches of His grace, demonstrated by His kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>For it is by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not from yourselves; it is the gift of God,
<span class="reftext">9</span>not by works, so that no one can boast.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance as our way of life.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">One in Christ<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Philippians 2:1–4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore remember that formerly you who are Gentiles in the flesh and called uncircumcised by the so-called circumcision (that done in the body by human hands)—
<span class="reftext">12</span>remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.
<span class="reftext">13</span>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>For He Himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has torn down the dividing wall of hostility
<span class="reftext">15</span>by abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments and decrees. He did this to create in Himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace
<span class="reftext">16</span>and reconciling both of them to God in one body through the cross, by which He extinguished their hostility.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For through Him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
</p><p class="hdg">Christ Our Cornerstone<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 28:14–22; 1 Corinthians 3:10–15; 1 Peter 2:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Therefore you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God’s household,
<span class="reftext">20</span>built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself as the cornerstone.
<span class="reftext">21</span>In Him the whole building is fitted together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord.
<span class="reftext">22</span>And in Him you too are being built together into a dwelling place for God in His Spirit.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
