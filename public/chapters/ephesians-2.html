<span class="reftext">2</span>in which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> used to walk when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> conformed to the ways of this world and of the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit who is now at work in the sons of disobedience.
<span class="reftext">3</span>All of us also lived among them at one time, fulfilling the cravings of our flesh and indulging its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature children of wrath.

<span class="reftext">15</span>by abolishing in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> flesh the law of commandments and decrees. He did this to create in <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> one new man out of the two, thus making peace
<span class="reftext">16</span>and reconciling both of them to God in one body through the cross, by which <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> extinguished their hostility.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>He came and preached peace to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> who were far away and peace to those who were near.
