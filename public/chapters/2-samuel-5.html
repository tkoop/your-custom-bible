<span class="reftext">2</span>Even in times past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them back. And to you the LORD said, ‘You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be ruler over them.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, where King David made with them a covenant before the LORD. And they anointed him king over Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years.
<span class="reftext">5</span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
</p><p class="hdg">David Conquers Jerusalem<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 11:4–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Now the king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites who inhabited the land. The Jebusites said to David: “You will never get in here. Even the blind and lame can repel you.” For they thought, “David cannot get in here.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the City of David).
<span class="reftext">8</span>On that day he said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites must use the water shaft to reach the lame and blind who are despised by David.<span class="fn">a</span>” That is why it is said, “The blind and the lame will never enter the palace.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So David took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built it up all the way around, from the supporting terraces<span class="fn">b</span>  inward.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of Hosts was with him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David.
</p><p class="hdg">David’s Family Grows<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 14:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>After he had arrived from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him.
<span class="reftext">14</span>These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua,<span class="fn">c</span>  Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
<span class="reftext">15</span>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
<span class="reftext">16</span>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
</p><p class="hdg">Two Victories over the Philistines<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 14:8–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they all went in search of him; but David learned of this and went down to the stronghold.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
<span class="reftext">19</span>So David inquired of the LORD, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” </p><p class="reg1">“Go,” replied the LORD, “for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So David went to Baal-perazim, where he defeated the Philistines and said, “Like a bursting flood, the LORD has burst out against my enemies before me.” So he called that place Baal-perazim.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>There the Philistines abandoned their idols, and David and his men carried them away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Once again the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
<span class="reftext">23</span>So David inquired of the LORD, who answered, “Do not march straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">24</span>As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move quickly, because this will mean that the LORD has marched out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>So David did as the LORD had commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon<span class="fn">f</span>  to Gezer.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">who are enemies of David</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the Millo</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Shammua</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Shimea</i>; see 1 Chronicles 3:5.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Baal-Perazim</i> means <i class="calibre6">The Lord Bursts Out</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">aspen trees</i> or <i class="calibre6">poplar trees</i>; also in verse 24<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> LXX (see also 1 Chronicles 14:16); Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Geba</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
