<span class="reftext">2</span>Even in times past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them back. And to you <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, ‘You will shepherd <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people Israel, and you will be ruler over them.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, where King David made with them a covenant before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. And they anointed him king over Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years.
<span class="reftext">5</span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
</p><p class="hdg">David Conquers Jerusalem<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 11:4–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Now the king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites who inhabited the land. The Jebusites said to David: “You will never get in here. Even the blind and lame can repel you.” For they thought, “David cannot get in here.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion (that is, the <span class='cap'>City</span><span class='nocap'>city</span><span class='bsb'>City</span> of David).
<span class="reftext">8</span>On that day he said, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites must use the water shaft to reach the lame and blind who are despised by David.<span class="fn">a</span>” That is why it is said, “The blind and the lame will never enter the palace.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So David took up residence in the fortress and called it the <span class='cap'>City</span><span class='nocap'>city</span><span class='bsb'>City</span> of David. He built it up all the way around, from the supporting terraces<span class="fn">b</span>  inward.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And David became greater and greater, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> God of Hosts was with him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David.
</p><p class="hdg">David’s Family Grows<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 14:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And David <span class='spell ca'>realized</span><span class='spell gb'>realised</span><span class='spell us'>realized</span> that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> people Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>After he had arrived from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him.
<span class="reftext">14</span>These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua,<span class="fn">c</span>  Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,

</p><p class="hdg">Two Victories over the Philistines<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 14:8–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they all went in search of him; but David learned of this and went down to the stronghold.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span><span class='bsb'>Valley</span> of Rephaim.
<span class="reftext">19</span>So David inquired of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> deliver them into my hand?” </p><p class="reg1">“Go,” replied <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So David went to Baal-perazim, where he defeated the Philistines and said, “Like a bursting flood, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has burst out against my enemies before me.” So he called that place Baal-perazim.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>There the Philistines abandoned their idols, and David and his men carried them away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Once again the Philistines came up and spread out in the <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span><span class='bsb'>Valley</span> of Rephaim.
<span class="reftext">23</span>So David inquired of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, who answered, “Do not march straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">24</span>As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move quickly, because this will mean that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has marched out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>So David did as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon<span class="fn">f</span>  to Gezer.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">who are enemies of David</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the Millo</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Shammua</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Shimea</i>; see 1 Chronicles 3:5.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Baal-Perazim</i> means <i class="calibre6">The Lord Bursts Out</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">aspen trees</i> or <i class="calibre6">poplar trees</i>; also in verse 24<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> LXX (see also 1 Chronicles 14:16); Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Geba</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
