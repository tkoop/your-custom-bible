<font ><b>The Mystery of the Gospel</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of
Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles... </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Surely you have heard about the
stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you, that is,
the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written
briefly. In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my
insight into the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to men
in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to
God’s holy apostles and prophets. This mystery is that through the
gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and
fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I became a servant of this gospel by the
gift of God’s grace, given me through the working of His power.
Though I am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was
given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of
Christ, and to illuminate for everyone the stewardship of this
mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all
things. His purpose was that now, through the church, the manifold
wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in
the heavenly realms, according to the eternal purpose that He
accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In Him and through faith in Him we may
enter God’s presence with boldness and confidence. So I ask you not
to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your
glory. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >... for this reason I bow my knees before
the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its
name. I ask that out of the riches of His glory He may strengthen you
with power through His Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may
dwell in your hearts through faith. Then you, being rooted and
grounded in love, will have power, together with all the saints, to
comprehend the length and width and height and depth of the love of
Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge, that you may
be filled with all the fullness of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably
more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at
work within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus
throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen. </font>
