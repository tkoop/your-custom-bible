<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Mystery of the Gospel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles...<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Surely you have heard about the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you,
<span class="reftext">3</span>that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.
<span class="reftext">4</span>In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
<span class="reftext">5</span>which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> to God’s holy apostles and prophets.
<span class="reftext">6</span>This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace, given me through the working of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> power.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Though I am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
<span class="reftext">9</span>and to illuminate for everyone the stewardship<span class="fn">b</span>  of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.
<span class="reftext">10</span>His purpose was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,
<span class="reftext">11</span>according to the eternal purpose that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>In <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and through faith in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class="fn">c</span>  we may enter God’s presence with boldness and confidence.
<span class="reftext">13</span>So I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Prayer for the Ephesians</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>... for this reason I bow my knees before the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>,<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span>from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.
<span class="reftext">16</span>I ask that out of the riches of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> glory <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> may strengthen you with power through <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> in your inner being,
<span class="reftext">17</span>so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. Then you, being rooted and grounded in love,
<span class="reftext">18</span>will have power, together with all the saints, to comprehend the length and width and height and depth
<span class="reftext">19</span>of the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> who is able to do immeasurably than all we ask or imagine, according to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> power that is at work within us,
<span class="reftext">21</span>to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> This train of thought is continued in verse 14.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> NE and WH <i class="calibre6">and to illuminate the stewardship</i>; TR <i class="calibre6">and to illuminate for everyone the fellowship</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">through His faithfulness</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
