<font >Now Abraham had taken another wife, named
Keturah, and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and
Shuah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan.
And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the
Leummites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher,
Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All these were descendants of Keturah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.
But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his
concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the
east. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Abraham lived a total of 175 years. And at
a ripe old age he breathed his last and died, old and contented, and
was gathered to his people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in
the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar
the Hittite. This was the field that Abraham had bought from the
Hittites. Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Abraham’s death, God blessed his
son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the account of Abraham’s son
Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to
Abraham. These are the names of the sons of Ishmael in the order of
their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel,
Mibsam, Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and
Kedemah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These were the sons of Ishmael, and these
were their names by their villages and encampments—twelve princes
of their tribes. Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. Then he breathed
his last and died, and was gathered to his people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ishmael’s descendants settled from
Havilah to Shur, which is near the border of Egypt as you go toward
Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the account of Abraham’s son
Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac, and Isaac was forty years
old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from
Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban the Aramean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Later, Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf
of his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD heard his prayer,
and his wife Rebekah conceived. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the children inside her struggled with
each other, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So
Rebekah went to inquire of the LORD, and He declared to her: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Two nations are in your womb, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and two peoples from within you will be
separated; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >one people will be stronger than the
other, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and the older will serve the younger.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When her time came to give birth, there
were indeed twins in her womb. The first one came out red, covered
with hair like a fur coat; so they named him Esau. After this, his
brother came out grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. And
Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the boys grew up, Esau became a
skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man who
stayed at home. Because Isaac had a taste for wild game, he loved
Esau; but Rebekah loved Jacob. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One day, while Jacob was cooking some
stew, Esau came in from the field and was famished. He said to Jacob,
“Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am famished.” (That is
why he was also called Edom.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >First sell me your birthright,” Jacob
replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Look,” said Esau, “I am about to
die, so what good is a birthright to me?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Swear to me first,” Jacob said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Esau swore to Jacob and sold him the
birthright. Then Jacob gave some bread and lentil stew to Esau, who
ate and drank and then got up and went away. Thus Esau despised his
birthright. </font>
