<font face="Tahoma, serif">His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in
the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When her time came to give birth, there
were indeed twins in her womb. The first one came out red, covered
with hair like a fur coat; so they named him Esau. After this, his
brother came out grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. And
Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the boys grew up, Esau became a
skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man who
stayed at home. Because Isaac had a taste for wild game, he loved
Esau; but Rebekah loved Jacob. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">One day, while Jacob was cooking some
stew, Esau came in from the field and was famished. He said to Jacob,
“Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am famished.” (That is
why he was also called Edom.) </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">First sell me your birthright,” Jacob

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Look,” said Esau, “I am about to

ate and drank and then got up and went away. Thus Esau despised his
birthright. </font>
