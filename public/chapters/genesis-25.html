<span class="reftext">2</span>and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. </p><p class="reg1"> All these were descendants of Keturah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.
</p><p class="hdg">The Death of Abraham</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Abraham lived a total of 175 years.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And at a ripe old age he breathed his last and died, old and contented, and was gathered to his people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite.
<span class="reftext">10</span>This was the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites. Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi.
</p><p class="hdg">The Descendants of Ishmael<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Chronicles 1:28–31)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham.
<span class="reftext">13</span>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
<span class="reftext">14</span>Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
<span class="reftext">15</span>Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>These were the sons of Ishmael, and these were their names by their villages and encampments—twelve princes of their tribes.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Ishmael’s descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which is near the border of Egypt as you go toward Asshur.<span class="fn">a</span>  And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.
</p><p class="hdg">Jacob and Esau<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Malachi 1:1–5; Romans 9:6–29)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>This is the account of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,
<span class="reftext">20</span>and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram<span class="fn">b</span>  and the sister of Laban the Aramean.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Later, Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD heard his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But the children inside her struggled with each other, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So Rebekah went to inquire of the LORD,
<span class="reftext">23</span>and He declared to her: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Two nations are in your womb, </p><p class="indent"> and two peoples from within you will be separated; </p><p class="indent1"> one people will be stronger than the other, </p><p class="indent"> and the older will serve the younger.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>When her time came to give birth, there were indeed twins in her womb.
<span class="reftext">25</span>The first one came out red, covered with hair like a fur coat; so they named him Esau.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">26</span>After this, his brother came out grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob.<span class="fn">e</span>  And Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>When the boys grew up, Esau became a skilful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Because Isaac had a taste for wild game, he loved Esau; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
</p><p class="hdg">Esau Sells His Birthright</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>One day, while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the field and was famished.
<span class="reftext">30</span>He said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am famished.” (That is why he was also called Edom.<span class="fn">f</span>)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>“First sell me your birthright,” Jacob replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>“Look,” said Esau, “I am about to die, so what good is a birthright to me?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>“Swear to me first,” Jacob said. </p><p class="reg1"> So Esau swore to Jacob and sold him the birthright.
<span class="reftext">34</span>Then Jacob gave some bread and lentil stew to Esau, who ate and drank and then got up and went away. Thus Esau despised his birthright.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Assyria</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, northwest Mesopotamia<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Cited in Romans 9:12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Esau</i> sounds like a Hebrew term that means <i class="calibre6">hairy</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Jacob</i> means <i class="calibre6">he grasps the heel</i> or <i class="calibre6">he deceives</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">Edom</i> means <i class="calibre6">red</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
