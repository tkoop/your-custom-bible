<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Ten Virgins</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">1</span>“At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take along any extra oil.
<span class="reftext">4</span>But the wise ones took oil in flasks along with their lamps.
<span class="reftext">5</span>When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">6</span>At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.
<span class="reftext">8</span>The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">9</span>‘No,’ said the wise ones, ‘or there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">10</span>But while they were on their way to buy it, the bridegroom arrived. Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet, and the door was shut.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">11</span>Later the other virgins arrived and said, ‘Lord, lord, open the door for us!’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">12</span>But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I do not know you.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Talents<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 19:11–27)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">14</span>For it is just like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted them with his possessions.
<span class="reftext">15</span>To one he gave five talents,<span class="fn">b</span>  to another two talents, and to another one talent—each according to his own ability. And he went on his journey.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">16</span>The servant who had received the five talents went at once and put them to work<span class="fn">c</span>  and gained five more.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Likewise, the one with the two talents gained two more.
<span class="reftext">18</span>But the servant who had received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">19</span>After a long time the master of those servants returned to settle accounts with them.
<span class="reftext">20</span>The servant who had received the five talents came and presented five more. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">21</span>His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">22</span>The servant who had received the two talents also came and said, ‘Master, you entrusted me with two talents. See, I have gained two more.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">23</span>His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master!’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">24</span>Finally, the servant who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Master, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.
<span class="reftext">25</span>So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what belongs to you.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">26</span>‘You wicked, lazy servant!’ replied his master. ‘You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed.
<span class="reftext">27</span>Then you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and on my return I would have received it back with interest.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents.
<span class="reftext">29</span>For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. But the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
<span class="reftext">30</span>And throw that worthless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
</p><p class="hdg">The Sheep and the Goats</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>When the Son of Man comes in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> glory, and all the angels with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will sit on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> glorious throne.

</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">34</span>Then the King will say to those on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
<span class="reftext">35</span>For I was hungry and you gave <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> something to drink, I was a stranger and you took <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> in,

</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">37</span>Then the righteous will answer <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, ‘Lord, when did we see <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> hungry and feed <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>, or thirsty and give <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> something to drink?
<span class="reftext">38</span>When did we see <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> a stranger and take <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> in, or naked and clothe <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>?
<span class="reftext">39</span>When did we see <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> sick or in prison and visit <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>?’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">40</span>And the King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of <span class='cap'>Mine</span><span class='nocap'>mine</span>, you did for <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">41</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will say to those on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> left, ‘Depart from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
<span class="reftext">42</span>For I was hungry and you gave <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> nothing to drink,
<span class="reftext">43</span>I was a stranger and you did not take <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> in, I was naked and you did not clothe <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, I was sick and in prison and you did not visit <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">44</span>And they too will reply, ‘Lord, when did we see <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>?’
