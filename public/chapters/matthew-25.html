kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and
went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five
were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take along
any extra oil. But the wise ones took oil in flasks along with their
lamps. When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and
fell asleep. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">The servant who had
received the five talents went at once and put them to work and
