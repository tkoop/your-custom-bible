kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and
went out to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five
were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take along
any extra oil. But the wise ones took oil in flasks along with their
lamps. When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and
fell asleep. </font></font>

woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise,

Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.’ </font></font>

on their way to buy it, the bridegroom arrived. Those who were ready

a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted them
with his possessions. To one he gave five talents, to another two
talents, and to another one talent—each according to his own
ability. And he went on his journey. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >The servant who had
received the five talents went at once and put them to work and
gained five more. Likewise, the one with the two talents gained two
more. But the servant who had received the one talent went off, dug a
hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >After a long time
the master of those servants returned to settle accounts with them.
The servant who had received the five talents came and presented five
more. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five talents.
See, I have gained five more.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >His master replied,
‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with
a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the
joy of your master!’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">

who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Master, I knew that
you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering
where you have not scattered seed. So I was afraid and went out and
hid your talent in the ground. See, you have what belongs to you.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >You wicked, lazy
servant!’ replied his master. ‘You knew that I reap where I have
not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed. Then you should

have received it back with interest. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Therefore take the
talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents. For
everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance.
But the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away
from him. And throw that worthless servant into the outer darkness,
where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ </font></font>

the goats on His left. </font></font>
