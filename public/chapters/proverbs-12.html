</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>The good man obtains favour from the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> but the LORD condemns a man who devises evil.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>A man cannot be established through wickedness, </p><p class="indent"> but the righteous cannot be uprooted.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>A wife of noble character is her husband’s crown, </p><p class="indent"> but she who causes shame is like decay in his bones.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>The plans of the righteous are just, </p><p class="indent"> but the counsel of the wicked leads to deceit.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, </p><p class="indent"> but the speech of the upright rescues them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>The wicked are overthrown and perish, </p><p class="indent"> but the house of the righteous will stand.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>A man is praised according to his wisdom, </p><p class="indent"> but a twisted mind is despised.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Better to be lightly esteemed yet have a servant, </p><p class="indent"> than to be self-important but lack food.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>A righteous man regards the life of his animal, </p><p class="indent"> but the tender mercies of the wicked are only cruelty.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>The one who works his land will have plenty of food, </p><p class="indent"> but whoever chases fantasies lacks judgment.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>The wicked desire the plunder of evil men, </p><p class="indent"> but the root of the righteous flourishes.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>An evil man is trapped by his rebellious speech, </p><p class="indent"> but a righteous man escapes from trouble.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>By fruitful speech a man is filled with good things, </p><p class="indent"> and the work of his hands returns to him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, </p><p class="indent"> but a wise man listens to counsel.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>A fool’s anger is known at once, </p><p class="indent"> but a prudent man overlooks an insult.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>He who speaks the truth declares what is right, </p><p class="indent"> but a false witness speaks deceit.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>Speaking rashly is like a piercing sword, </p><p class="indent"> but the tongue of the wise brings healing.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>Truthful lips endure forever, </p><p class="indent"> but a lying tongue lasts only a moment.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Deceit is in the hearts of those who devise evil, </p><p class="indent"> but the counsellors of peace have joy.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>No harm befalls the righteous, </p><p class="indent"> but the wicked are filled with trouble.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>Lying lips are detestable to the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> but those who deal faithfully are His delight.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>A shrewd man keeps his knowledge to himself, </p><p class="indent"> but a foolish heart proclaims its folly.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>The hand of the diligent will rule, </p><p class="indent"> but laziness ends in forced labour.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>Anxiety weighs down the heart of a man, </p><p class="indent"> but a good word cheers it up.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>A righteous man is cautious in friendship, </p><p class="indent"> but the ways of the wicked lead them astray.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>A lazy man does not roast his game, </p><p class="indent"> but a diligent man prizes his possession.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">28</span>There is life in the path of righteousness, </p><p class="indent"> but another path leads to death.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
