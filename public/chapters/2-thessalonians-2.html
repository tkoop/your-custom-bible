<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Man of Lawlessness</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to Him, we ask you, brothers,
<span class="reftext">2</span>not to be easily disconcerted or alarmed by any spirit or message or letter seeming to be from us, alleging that the Day of the Lord has already come.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Let no one deceive you in any way, for it will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness—the son of destruction—is revealed.
<span class="reftext">4</span>He will oppose and exalt himself above every so-called god or object of worship. So he will seat himself in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Do you not remember that I told you these things while I was still with you?
<span class="reftext">6</span>And you know what is now restraining him, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work, but the one who now restrains it will continue until he is taken out of the way.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will slay with the breath of His mouth and annihilate by the majesty of His arrival.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The coming of the lawless one will be accompanied by the working of Satan, with every kind of power, sign, and false wonder,
<span class="reftext">10</span>and with every wicked deception directed against those who are perishing, because they refused the love of the truth that would have saved them.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For this reason God will send them a powerful delusion so that they believe the lie,
<span class="reftext">12</span>in order that <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> may come upon all who have disbelieved the truth and delighted in wickedness.
</p><p class="hdg">Stand Firm</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But we should always thank God for you, brothers who are loved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning<span class="fn">a</span>  to be saved by the sanctification of the Spirit and by faith in the truth.
<span class="reftext">14</span>To this He called you through our gospel, so that you may share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Therefore, brothers, stand firm and cling to the traditions we taught you, whether by speech or by letter.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who by grace has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope,
<span class="reftext">17</span>encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good word and deed.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">God has chosen you as the firstfruits</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
