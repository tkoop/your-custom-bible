</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy began ministering to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> before Eli the priest.
</p><p class="hdg">Eli’s Wicked Sons</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Now the sons of Eli were wicked men; they had no regard for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>
<span class="reftext">13</span>or for the custom of the priests with the people. </p><p class="reg1"> When any man offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged meat fork while the meat was boiling
<span class="reftext">14</span>and plunge it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or cooking pot. And the priest would claim for himself whatever the meat fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast, because he will not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And if any man said to him, “The fat must be burned first; then you may take whatever you want,” the servant would reply, “No, you must give it to me right now. If you refuse, I will take it by force!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Thus the sin of these young men was severe in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, for they<span class="fn">b</span>  were treating <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s offering with contempt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Now Samuel was ministering before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>—a boy wearing a linen ephod.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Each year his mother would make him a little robe and bring it to him when she went with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> give you children by this woman in place of the one she dedicated to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.<span class="fn">c</span>” Then they would go home.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> attended to Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. </p><p class="reg1"> Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Now Eli was very old, and he heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>“Why are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> doing these things?” Eli said to his sons. “I hear about <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> wicked deeds from all these people.
<span class="reftext">24</span>No, my sons; it is not a good report I hear circulating among <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s people.
<span class="reftext">25</span>If a man sins against another man, God<span class="fn">d</span>  can intercede for him; but if a man sins against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, who can intercede for him?” </p><p class="reg1"> But they would not listen to their father, since <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> intended to put them to death.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> with <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and with man.
</p><p class="hdg">A Prophecy against the House of Eli</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then a man of God came to Eli and told him, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘Did I not clearly reveal <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span> to your father’s house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh’s house?
<span class="reftext">28</span>And out of all the tribes of Israel I selected your father to be <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> priest, to offer sacrifices on <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> presence. I also gave to the house of your father all the offerings of the Israelites made by fire.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Why then do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> kick at<span class="fn">e</span>  <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sacrifice and offering that I have prescribed for <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> dwelling place? You have <span class='spell ca'>honoured</span><span class='spell gb'>honoured</span><span class='spell us'>honored</span> your sons more than <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> by fattening yourselves with the best of all the offerings of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people Israel.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Therefore, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, declares: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘I did indeed say that your house </p><p class="indent"> and the house of your father </p><p class="indent"> would walk before <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> forever. </p><p class="indent1stline"> But now <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> declares: </p><p class="indent"> Far be it from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>! </p><p class="indent1"> For I will <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> those who <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, </p><p class="indent"> but those who despise <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> will be disdained.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so that no older man will be left in your house.
<span class="reftext">32</span>You will see distress in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> dwelling place. Despite all that is good in Israel, no one in your house will ever again reach old age.
<span class="reftext">33</span>And every one of you that I do not cut off from <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> altar, your eyes will fail and your heart will grieve.<span class="fn">f</span>  All your descendants<span class="fn">g</span>  will die by the sword of men.<span class="fn">h</span>
