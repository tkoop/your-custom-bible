“<font >My heart rejoices in the LORD </font>

<font >Do not boast so proudly, </font>

<font >The bows of the mighty are broken, </font>

<font >The LORD will judge the ends of the earth </font>

<font >He will exalt the horn of His anointed.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the
boy began ministering to the LORD before Eli the priest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the sons of Eli were wicked men; they
had no regard for the LORD or for the custom of the priests with the
people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When any man offered a sacrifice, the
servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged meat fork while
the meat was boiling and plunge it into the pan or kettle or cauldron
or cooking pot. And the priest would claim for himself whatever the
meat fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who
came to Shiloh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Even before the fat was burned, the
servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was
sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast, because he will
not accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And if any man said to him, “The fat
must be burned first; then you may take whatever you want,” the
servant would reply, “No, you must give it to me right now. If you
refuse, I will take it by force!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus the sin of these young men was severe
in the sight of the LORD, for they were treating the LORD’s
offering with contempt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Samuel was ministering before the
LORD—a boy wearing a linen ephod. Each year his mother would make
him a little robe and bring it to him when she went with her husband
to offer the annual sacrifice. And Eli would bless Elkanah and his
wife, saying, “May the LORD give you children by this woman in
place of the one she dedicated to the LORD.” Then they would go
home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the LORD attended to Hannah, and she
conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the
presence of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Eli was very old, and he heard about
everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they were
sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Why are you doing these things?” Eli
said to his sons. “I hear about your wicked deeds from all these
people. No, my sons; it is not a good report I hear circulating among
the LORD’s people. If a man sins against another man, God can
intercede for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can
intercede for him?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But they would not listen to their father,
since the LORD intended to put them to death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the boy Samuel continued to grow in
stature and in favor with the LORD and with man. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a man of God came to Eli and told
him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Did I not clearly reveal
Myself to your father’s house when they were in Egypt under
Pharaoh’s house? And out of all the tribes of Israel I selected
your father to be My priest, to offer sacrifices on My altar, to burn
incense, and to wear an ephod in My presence. I also gave to the
house of your father all the offerings of the Israelites made by
fire. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Why then do you kick at My sacrifice and
offering that I have prescribed for My dwelling place? You have
honored your sons more than Me by fattening yourselves with the best
of all the offerings of My people Israel.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, the LORD, the God of Israel,
declares: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >I did indeed say that your house </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and the house of your father </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >would walk before Me forever. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >But now the LORD declares: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Far be it from Me! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >For I will honor those who honor Me, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >but those who despise Me will be
disdained. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Behold, the days are coming when I will
cut off your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so
that no older man will be left in your house. You will see distress
in My dwelling place. Despite all that is good in Israel, no one in
your house will ever again reach old age. And every one of you that I
do not cut off from My altar, your eyes will fail and your heart will
grieve. All your descendants will die by the sword of men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And this sign shall come to you concerning
your two sons Hophni and Phinehas: They will both die on the same
day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful
priest. He will do whatever is in My heart and mind. And I will build
for him an enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed one
for all time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And everyone left in your house will come
and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a morsel of bread,
pleading, “Please appoint me to some priestly office so that I can
eat a piece of bread.”<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
