<font ><b>Ashore on Malta</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once we were safely ashore, we learned
that the island was called Malta. The islanders showed us
extraordinary kindness. They kindled a fire and welcomed all of us
because it was raining and cold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Paul gathered a bundle of sticks, and as
he laid them on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened
itself to his hand. When the islanders saw the creature hanging from
his hand, they said to one another, “Surely this man is a murderer.
Although he was saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to
live.” But Paul shook the creature off into the fire and suffered
no ill effects. The islanders were expecting him to swell up or
suddenly drop dead. But after waiting a long time and seeing nothing
unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a
god. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nearby stood an estate belonging to
Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us and
entertained us hospitably for three days. The father of Publius was
sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see
him, and after praying and placing his hands on him, he healed the
man. After this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came
and were cured as well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The islanders honored us in many ways and
supplied our needs when we were ready to sail. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After three months we set sail in an
Alexandrian ship that had wintered in the island. It had the Twin
Brothers as a figurehead. Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there
three days. From there we weighed anchor and came to Rhegium. After
one day, a south wind came up, and on the second day we arrived at
Puteoli. There we found some brothers who invited us to spend the
week with them. And so we came to Rome. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The brothers there had heard about us and
traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet
us. When Paul saw them, he was encouraged and gave thanks to God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When we arrived in Rome, Paul was
permitted to stay by himself, with a soldier to guard him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After three days, he called together the
leaders of the Jews. When they had gathered, he said to them,
“Brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or the
customs of our fathers, I was taken prisoner in Jerusalem and handed
over to the Romans. They examined me and wanted to release me,
because there was no basis for a death sentence against me. But when
the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, even though I
have no charge to bring against my nation. So for this reason I have
called to see you and speak with you. It is because of the hope of
Israel that I am bound with this chain.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The leaders replied, “We have not
received any letters about you from Judea, nor have any of the
brothers from there reported or even mentioned anything bad about
you. But we consider your views worth hearing, because we know that
people everywhere are speaking against this sect.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they set a day to meet with Paul, and
many people came to the place he was staying. He expounded to them
from morning to evening, testifying about the kingdom of God and
persuading them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and the Prophets. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some of them were convinced by what he
said, but others refused to believe. They disagreed among themselves
and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: “The
Holy Spirit was right when He spoke to your fathers through Isaiah
the prophet: </font>

<font >Be advised, therefore, that God’s
salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Paul stayed there two full years in his
own rented house, welcoming all who came to visit him. Boldly and
freely he proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord
Jesus Christ. </font>
