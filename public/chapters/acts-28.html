<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Paul gathered a bundle of sticks, and as he laid them on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself to his hand.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a><span class="reftext">4</span>When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “Surely this man is a murderer. Although he was saved from the sea, Justice<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">a</a></span>  has not allowed him to live.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a><span class="reftext">5</span>But Paul shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no ill effects.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a><span class="reftext">6</span>The islanders were expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. But after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Nearby stood an estate belonging to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a><span class="reftext">8</span>The father of Publius was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him, and after praying and placing his hands on him, he healed the man.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a><span class="reftext">9</span>After this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured as well.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>The islanders honored us in many ways and supplied our needs when we were ready to sail.

It had the Twin Brothers<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">b</a></span>  as a figurehead.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a><span class="reftext">12</span>Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a><span class="reftext">13</span>From there we weighed anchor and came to Rhegium. After one day, a south wind came up, and on the second day we arrived at Puteoli.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a><span class="reftext">14</span>There we found some brothers who invited us to spend the week with them. And so we came to Rome.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The brothers there had heard about us and traveled as far as the Forum of Appius<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">c</a></span>  and the Three Taverns<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">d</a></span>  to meet us. When Paul saw them, he was encouraged and gave thanks to God.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a></p><p class="hdg">Paul Preaches at Rome<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(<a href="685.htm" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">Isaiah 6:1–13</a>)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When we arrived in Rome,<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">e</a></span>  Paul was permitted to stay by himself, with a soldier to guard him.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>After three days, he called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had gathered, he said to them, “Brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, I was taken prisoner in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a><span class="reftext">18</span>They examined me and wanted to release me, because there was no basis for a death sentence against me.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a><span class="reftext">19</span>But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, even though I have no charge to bring against my nation.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a><span class="reftext">20</span>So for this reason I have called to see you and speak with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="21"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>The leaders replied, “We have not received any letters about you from Judea, nor have any of the brothers from there reported or even mentioned anything bad about you.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a><span class="reftext">22</span>But we consider your views worth hearing, because we know that people everywhere are speaking against this sect.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="23"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So they set a day to meet with Paul, and many people came to the place he was staying. He expounded to them from morning to evening, testifying about the kingdom of God and persuading them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and the Prophets.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="24"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Some of them were convinced by what he said, but others refused to believe.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a><span class="reftext">25</span>They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: “The Holy Spirit was right when He spoke to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:
