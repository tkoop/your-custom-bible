<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Prophecy against Mount Seir</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Moreover, the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline"> Behold, I am against you, </p><p class="indent"> O Mount Seir. </p><p class="indent1"> I will stretch out <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> hand against you </p><p class="indent"> and make you a desolate waste.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I will turn your cities into ruins, </p><p class="indent"> and you will become a desolation. </p><p class="indent1stline"> Then you will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Because you harbored an ancient hatred and delivered the Israelites over to the sword in the time of their disaster at the final stage of their punishment,
<span class="reftext">6</span>therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, it will pursue you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and will cut off from it those who come and go.
<span class="reftext">8</span>I will fill its mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines.
<span class="reftext">9</span>I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Because you have said, ‘These two nations and countries will be ours, and we will possess them,’ even though <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was there,
<span class="reftext">11</span>therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will treat you according to the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred against them, and I will make <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span><span class='bsb'>Myself</span> known among them when I judge you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then you will know that I, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, have heard every contemptuous word you uttered against the mountains of Israel when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> said, ‘They are desolate; they are given to us to devour!’
<span class="reftext">13</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> boasted against <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> with your mouth and multiplied <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> words against <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>. I heard it <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span><span class='bsb'>Myself</span>!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: While the whole <span class='cap'>Earth</span><span class='nocap'>earth</span><span class='bsb'>earth</span> rejoices, I will make you desolate.
<span class="reftext">15</span>As you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel became desolate, so will I do to you. You will become a desolation, O Mount Seir, and so will all of Edom. Then they will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
