<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Prophecy against Mount Seir</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a><span class="reftext">2</span>“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a><span class="reftext">3</span>and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline"> Behold, I am against you, </p><p class="indent"> O Mount Seir. </p><p class="indent1"> I will stretch out My hand against you </p><p class="indent"> and make you a desolate waste.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a></p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I will turn your cities into ruins, </p><p class="indent"> and you will become a desolation. </p><p class="indent1stline"> Then you will know that I am the LORD.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Because you harbored an ancient hatred and delivered the Israelites over to the sword in the time of their disaster at the final stage of their punishment,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a><span class="reftext">6</span>therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, it will pursue you.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and will cut off from it those who come and go.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a><span class="reftext">8</span>I will fill its mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a><span class="reftext">9</span>I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Because you have said, ‘These two nations and countries will be ours, and we will possess them,’ even though the LORD was there,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a><span class="reftext">11</span>therefore as surely as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will treat you according to the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred against them, and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then you will know that I, the LORD, have heard every contemptuous word you uttered against the mountains of Israel when you said, ‘They are desolate; they are given to us to devour!’
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a><span class="reftext">13</span>You boasted against Me with your mouth and multiplied your words against Me. I heard it Myself!
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a><span class="reftext">15</span>As you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel became desolate, so will I do to you. You will become a desolation, O Mount Seir, and so will all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the LORD.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
