<font ><b>A Prophecy against Mount Seir</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy
against it, and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Behold, I am against you, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >O Mount Seir. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will stretch out My hand against you </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and make you a desolate waste. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >I will turn your cities into ruins, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and you will become a desolation. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Then you will know that I am the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because you harbored an ancient hatred and
delivered the Israelites over to the sword in the time of their
disaster at the final stage of their punishment, therefore as surely
as I live, declares the Lord GOD, I will give you over to bloodshed
and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, it will
pursue you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste
and will cut off from it those who come and go. I will fill its
mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your
hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines. I will make you a
perpetual desolation, and your cities will not be inhabited. Then you
will know that I am the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because you have said, ‘These two
nations and countries will be ours, and we will possess them,’ even
though the LORD was there, therefore as surely as I live, declares
the Lord GOD, I will treat you according to the anger and jealousy
you showed in your hatred against them, and I will make Myself known
among them when I judge you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then you will know that I, the LORD, have
heard every contemptuous word you uttered against the mountains of
Israel when you said, ‘They are desolate; they are given to us to
devour!’ You boasted against Me with your mouth and multiplied your
words against Me. I heard it Myself! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the Lord GOD says: While the
whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate. As you rejoiced when
the inheritance of the house of Israel became desolate, so will I do
to you. You will become a desolation, O Mount Seir, and so will all
of Edom. Then they will know that I am the LORD. </font>
