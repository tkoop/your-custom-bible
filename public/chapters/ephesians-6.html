<font face="Tahoma, serif">Children, obey your parents in the Lord,
for this is right. “Honor your father and mother” (which is the
first commandment with a promise), “that it may go well with you
and that you may have a long life on the earth.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Fathers, do not provoke your children to
wrath; instead, bring them up in the discipline and instruction of
the Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Slaves, obey your earthly masters with
respect and fear and sincerity of heart, just as you would obey
Christ. And do this not only to please them while they are watching,
but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.
Serve with good will, as to the Lord and not to men, because you know
that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good he does, whether
he is slave or free. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And masters, do the same for your slaves.
Give up your use of threats, because you know that He who is both
their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with
Him. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Finally, be strong in the Lord and in His
mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can make your
stand against the devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against
flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities,
against the powers of this world’s darkness, and against the
spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore take up the full armor of God,
so that when the day of evil comes, you will be able to stand your
ground, and having done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with
the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of
righteousness arrayed, and with your feet fitted with the readiness
of the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield
of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the
evil one. And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the
Spirit, which is the word of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Pray in the Spirit at all times, with
every kind of prayer and petition. To this end, stay alert with all
perseverance in your prayers for all the saints. Pray also for me,
that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will
boldly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an
ambassador in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it fearlessly, as I
should. </font>

know about me and what I am doing. I have sent him to you for this
very purpose, that you may know about us, and that he may encourage
your hearts. </font>
