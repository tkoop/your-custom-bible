<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Shunammite’s Land Restored</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, “Arise, you and your household; go and live as a foreigner wherever you can. For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has decreed a seven-year famine, and it has already come to the land.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>So the woman had proceeded to do as the man of God had instructed. And she and her household lived as foreigners for seven years in the land of the Philistines.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>At the end of seven years, when the woman returned from the land of the Philistines, she went to the king to appeal for her house and her land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now the king had been speaking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please relate to me all the great things Elisha has done.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought the dead back to life. Just then the woman whose son Elisha had revived came to appeal to the king for her house and her land. So Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is the son Elisha restored to life.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>When the king asked the woman, she confirmed it. So the king appointed for her an officer, saying, “Restore all that was hers, along with all the proceeds of the field from the day that she left the country until now.”
</p><p class="hdg">Hazael Murders Ben-hadad</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then Elisha came to Damascus while Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick, and the king was told, “The man of God has come here.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand, go to meet the man of God, and inquire of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> through him, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him a gift of forty camel loads of every good thing from Damascus. And he went in and stood before him and said, “Your son Ben-hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Elisha answered, “Go and tell him, ‘You will surely recover.’ But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span><span class="fn">a</span>  has shown me that in fact he will die.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Elisha fixed his gaze steadily on him until Hazael became uncomfortable. Then the man of God began to weep.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“Why is my lord weeping?” asked Hazael. </p><p class="reg1">“Because I know the evil you will do to the Israelites,” Elisha replied. “You will set fire to their fortresses, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little ones to pieces, and rip open their pregnant women.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>“But how could your servant, a mere dog, do such a monstrous thing?” said Hazael. </p><p class="reg1"> And Elisha answered, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> has shown me that you will be king over Aram.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So Hazael left Elisha and went to his master, who asked him, “What did Elisha say to you?” </p><p class="reg1"> And he replied, “He told me that you would surely recover.”
<span class="reftext">15</span>But the next day Hazael took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it over the king’s face. </p><p class="reg1"> So Ben-hadad died, and Hazael reigned in his place.

<span class="reftext">17</span>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And Jehoram walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done. For he married a daughter of Ahab and did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Yet for the sake of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> servant David, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was unwilling to destroy Judah, since <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So to this day Edom has been in rebellion against the hand of Judah. Likewise, Libnah rebelled at the same time.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>As for the rest of the acts of Jehoram, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
