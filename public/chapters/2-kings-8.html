<font ><b>The Shunammite’s Land Restored</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son
he had restored to life, “Arise, you and your household; go and
live as a foreigner wherever you can. For the LORD has decreed a
seven-year famine, and it has already come to the land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the woman had proceeded to do as the
man of God had instructed. And she and her household lived as
foreigners for seven years in the land of the Philistines. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At the end of seven years, when the woman
returned from the land of the Philistines, she went to the king to
appeal for her house and her land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the king had been speaking to Gehazi,
the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please relate to me all the
great things Elisha has done.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha
had brought the dead back to life. Just then the woman whose son
Elisha had revived came to appeal to the king for her house and her
land. So Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman, and
this is the son Elisha restored to life.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the king asked the woman, she
confirmed it. So the king appointed for her an officer, saying,
“Restore all that was hers, along with all the proceeds of the
field from the day that she left the country until now.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Elisha came to Damascus while
Ben-hadad king of Aram was sick, and the king was told, “The man of
God has come here.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king said to Hazael, “Take a gift
in your hand, go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the LORD
through him, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with
him a gift of forty camel loads of every good thing from Damascus.
And he went in and stood before him and said, “Your son Ben-hadad
king of Aram has sent me to ask, ‘Will I recover from this
illness?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Elisha answered, “Go and tell him, ‘You
will surely recover.’ But the LORD has shown me that in fact he
will die.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Elisha fixed his gaze steadily on him
until Hazael became uncomfortable. Then the man of God began to weep.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Why is my lord weeping?” asked
Hazael. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Because I know the evil you will do to
the Israelites,” Elisha replied. “You will set fire to their
fortresses, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little
ones to pieces, and rip open their pregnant women.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >But how could your servant, a mere dog,
do such a monstrous thing?” said Hazael. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Elisha answered, “The LORD has shown
me that you will be king over Aram.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Hazael left Elisha and went to his
master, who asked him, “What did Elisha say to you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And he replied, “He told me that you
would surely recover.” But the next day Hazael took a thick cloth,
dipped it in water, and spread it over the king’s face. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Ben-hadad died, and Hazael reigned in
his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the fifth year of the reign of Joram
son of Ahab over Israel, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat succeeded his
father as king of Judah. Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehoram walked in the ways of the
kings of Israel, just as the house of Ahab had done. For he married a
daughter of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet for the sake of His servant David, the
LORD was unwilling to destroy Judah, since He had promised to
maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the days of Jehoram, Edom rebelled
against the hand of Judah and appointed their own king. So Jehoram
crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. When the Edomites
surrounded him and his chariot commanders, he rose up and attacked by
night. His troops, however, fled to their homes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So to this day Edom has been in rebellion
against the hand of Judah. Likewise, Libnah rebelled at the same
time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Jehoram,
along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the book
of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehoram rested with his fathers and
was buried with them in the City of David. And his son Ahaziah
reigned in his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the twelfth year of the reign of Joram
son of Ahab over Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah.
Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned
in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the
granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Ahaziah walked in the ways of the
house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of
Ahab, for he was a son-in-law of the house of Ahab. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab
to fight against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead, and the
Arameans wounded Joram. So King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover
from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah when
he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram
king of Judah went down to Jezreel to visit Joram son of Ahab,
because Joram had been wounded. </font>
