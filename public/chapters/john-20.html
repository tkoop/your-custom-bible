<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Early on the first day of the week, while
it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the
stone had been removed from the entrance. So she came running to
Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. “They
have taken the Lord out of the tomb,” she said, “and we do not
know where they have put Him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Peter and the other disciple set out
for the tomb. The two were running together, but the other disciple
outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent down and looked in
at the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Simon Peter arrived just after him. He
entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there. The cloth that
had been around Jesus’ head was rolled up, lying separate from the
linen cloths. Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb
first, also went in. And he saw and believed. For they still did not
understand from the Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the disciples returned to their
homes. But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she
bent down to look into the tomb, and she saw two angels in white
sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the
other at the feet. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Woman, why are you weeping?” they
asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Because they have taken my Lord away,”
she said, “and I do not know where they have put Him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When she had said this, she turned around
and saw Jesus standing there; but she did not recognize that it was
Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Woman, why are
you weeping?”</font> Jesus asked. <font color="#a80000">“Whom are
you seeking?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thinking He was the gardener, she said,
“Sir, if you have carried Him off, tell me where you have put Him,
and I will get Him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus said to her, <font color="#a80000">“Mary.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >She turned and said to Him in Hebrew,
“Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”). </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Do not cling to
Me,”</font> Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“for I have not yet
ascended to the Father. But go and tell My brothers, ‘I am
ascending to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font color="#880000"> </font></font><font color="#a80000">”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Mary Magdalene went and announced to the
disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what He had
said to her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >It was the first day of the week, and that
very evening, while the disciples were together with the doors locked
for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them. <font color="#a80000">“Peace
be with you!”</font> He said to them. After He had said this, He
showed them His hands and His side. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The disciples rejoiced when they saw the
Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Peace
be with you. As the Father has sent Me, so also I am sending you.”</font>
When He had said this, He breathed on them and said, <font color="#a80000">“Receive
the Holy Spirit. If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven;
if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Thomas called Didymus, one of the
Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. So the other
disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But he replied, “Unless I see the nail
marks in His hands, and put my finger where the nails have been, and
put my hand into His side, I will never believe.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Eight days later, His disciples were once
again inside with the doors locked, and Thomas was with them. Jesus
came and stood among them and said, <font color="#a80000">“Peace be
with you.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to Thomas, <font color="#a80000">“Put
your finger here and look at My hands. Reach out your hand and put it
into My side. Stop doubting and believe.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thomas replied, “My Lord and my God!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus said to him, <font color="#a80000">“Because
you have seen Me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not
seen and yet have believed.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus performed many other signs in the
presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book. But
these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name. </font>
