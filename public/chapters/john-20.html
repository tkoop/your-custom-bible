<font face="Tahoma, serif">Early on the first day of the week, while
it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the
stone had been removed from the entrance. So she came running to
Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. “They
have taken the Lord out of the tomb,” she said, “and we do not
know where they have put Him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Peter and the other disciple set out
for the tomb. The two were running together, but the other disciple
outran Peter and reached the tomb first. He bent down and looked in
at the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Simon Peter arrived just after him. He
entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there. The cloth that
had been around Jesus’ head was rolled up, lying separate from the
linen cloths. Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb
first, also went in. And he saw and believed. For they still did not
understand from the Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the disciples returned to their
homes. But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she
bent down to look into the tomb, and she saw two angels in white
sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the
other at the feet. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
