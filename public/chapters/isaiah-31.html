</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Yet He too is wise and brings disaster; </p><p class="indent"> He does not call back His words. </p><p class="indent1"> He will rise up against the house of the wicked </p><p class="indent"> and against the allies of evildoers.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But the Egyptians are men, not God; </p><p class="indent"> their horses are flesh, not spirit. </p><p class="indent1"> When the LORD stretches out His hand, </p><p class="indent"> the helper will stumble, </p><p class="indent1"> and the one he helps will fall; </p><p class="indent"> both will perish together.
</p><p class="indent1stline"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>For this is what the LORD has said to me: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Like a lion roaring </p><p class="indent"> or a young lion over its prey—</p><p class="indent1"> and though a band of shepherds is called out against it, </p><p class="indent"> it is not terrified by their shouting </p><p class="indent"> or subdued by their clamour—</p><p class="indent1"> so the LORD of Hosts will come down </p><p class="indent"> to do battle on Mount Zion and its heights.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Like birds hovering overhead, </p><p class="indent"> so the LORD of Hosts will protect Jerusalem. </p><p class="indent1"> He will shield it and deliver it; </p><p class="indent"> He will pass over it and preserve it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Return to the One against whom you have so blatantly rebelled, O children of Israel.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For on that day, every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold that your own hands have sinfully made.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>“Then Assyria will fall, </p><p class="indent"> but not by the sword of man; </p><p class="indent1"> a sword will devour them, </p><p class="indent"> but not one made by mortals. </p><p class="indent1"> They will flee before the sword, </p><p class="indent"> and their young men will be put to forced labour.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Their rock will pass away for fear, </p><p class="indent"> and their princes will panic at the sight of the battle standard,” </p><p class="indent1"> declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, </p><p class="indent"> whose furnace is in Jerusalem.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
