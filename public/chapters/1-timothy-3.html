<span class="reftext">2</span>An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife,<span class="fn">a</span>  temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
<span class="reftext">3</span>not dependent on wine, not violent but gentle, peaceable, and free of the love of money.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>An overseer must manage his own household well and keep his children under control, with complete dignity.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for the church of God?
<span class="reftext">6</span>He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same condemnation as the devil.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Furthermore, he must have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the snare of the devil.

<span class="reftext">9</span>They must hold to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Additionally, they must first be tested. Then, if they are above reproach, let them serve as deacons.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>In the same way, the women<span class="fn">b</span>  must be dignified, not slanderers, but temperate and faithful in all things.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>A deacon must be the husband of but one wife, a good manager of his children and of his own household.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For those who have served well as deacons acquire for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
