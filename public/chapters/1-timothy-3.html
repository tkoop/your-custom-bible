<font ><b>Qualifications for Overseers and
Deacons</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is a trustworthy saying: If anyone
aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble task. An overseer,
then, must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate,
self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not
dependent on wine, not violent but gentle, peaceable, and free of the
love of money. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >An overseer must manage his own household
well and keep his children under control, with complete dignity. For
if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he
care for the church of God? He must not be a recent convert, or he
may become conceited and fall under the same condemnation as the
devil. Furthermore, he must have a good reputation with outsiders, so
that he will not fall into disgrace and into the snare of the devil. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Deacons likewise must be dignified, not
double-tongued or given to much wine or greedy for money. They must
hold to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
Additionally, they must first be tested. Then, if they are above
reproach, let them serve as deacons. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the same way, the women must be
dignified, not slanderers, but temperate and faithful in all things. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A deacon must be the husband of but one
wife, a good manager of his children and of his own household. For
those who have served well as deacons acquire for themselves a high
standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. </font>

<font >Although I hope to come to you soon, I am
writing you these things in case I am delayed, so that you will know
how each one must conduct himself in Godâ€™s household, which is the
church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. </font>
