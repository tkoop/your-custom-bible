<font >Wives, in the same way, submit yourselves
to your husbands, so that even if they refuse to believe the word,
they will be won over without words by the behavior of their wives
when they see your pure and reverent demeanor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Your beauty should not come from outward
adornment, such as braided hair or gold jewelry or fine clothes, but
from the inner disposition of your heart, the unfading beauty of a
gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in God’s sight. For this
is how the holy women of the past adorned themselves. They put their
hope in God and were submissive to their husbands, just as Sarah
obeyed Abraham and called him lord. And you are her children if you
do what is right and refuse to give way to fear. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Husbands, in the same way, treat your
wives with consideration as a delicate vessel, and with honor as
fellow heirs of the gracious gift of life, so that your prayers will
not be hindered. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Finally, all of you, be like-minded and
sympathetic, love as brothers, be tenderhearted and humble. Do not
repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing,
because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.

<font >But even if you should suffer for what is
right, you are blessed. “Do not fear what they fear; do not be
shaken.” But in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord. Always be
prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you the reason for
the hope that is in you. But respond with gentleness and respect,
keeping a clear conscience, so that those who slander you may be put
to shame by your good behavior in Christ. For it is better, if it is
God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. </font>

<font >For Christ also suffered for sins once for
all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was
put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit, in whom He
also went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long
ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was
being built. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the ark a few people, only eight souls,
were saved through water. And this water symbolizes the baptism that
now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body, but the
pledge of a clear conscience toward God—through the resurrection of
Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of
God, with angels, authorities, and powers subject to Him. </font>
