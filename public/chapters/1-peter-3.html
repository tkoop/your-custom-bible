<font face="Tahoma, serif">Your beauty should not come from outward
adornment, such as braided hair or gold jewelry or fine clothes, but
from the inner disposition of your heart, the unfading beauty of a
gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in God’s sight. For this
is how the holy women of the past adorned themselves. They put their
hope in God and were submissive to their husbands, just as Sarah
obeyed Abraham and called him lord. And you are her children if you
do what is right and refuse to give way to fear. </font>

not be hindered. </font>

keeping a clear conscience, so that those who slander you may be put
to shame by your good behavior in Christ. For it is better, if it is
God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. </font>

being built. </font>

now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body, but the
pledge of a clear conscience toward God—through the resurrection of
Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of
God, with angels, authorities, and powers subject to Him. </font>
