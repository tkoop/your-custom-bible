<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Wives and Husbands<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Song of Solomon 1:1–17; Ephesians 5:22–33)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Wives, in the same way, submit yourselves to your husbands, so that even if they refuse to believe the word, they will be won over without words by the behavior of their wives
<span class="reftext">2</span>when they see your pure and reverent demeanor.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair or gold jewelry or fine clothes,
<span class="reftext">4</span>but from the inner disposition of your heart, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in God’s sight.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For this is how the holy women of the past adorned themselves. They put their hope in God and were submissive to their husbands,
<span class="reftext">6</span>just as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. And you are her children if you do what is right and refuse to give way to fear.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Husbands, in the same way, treat your wives with consideration as a delicate vessel, and with honor as fellow heirs of the gracious gift of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.
</p><p class="hdg">Turning from Evil</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Finally, all of you, be like-minded and sympathetic, love as brothers, be tenderhearted and humble.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For, </p><p class="indent1stline">“Whoever would love life </p><p class="indent"> and see good days </p><p class="indent1"> must keep his tongue from evil </p><p class="indent"> and his lips from deceitful speech.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>He must turn from evil and do good; </p><p class="indent"> he must seek peace and pursue it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, </p><p class="indent"> and His ears are inclined to their prayer. </p><p class="indent1"> But the face of the Lord is against </p><p class="indent"> those who do evil.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Who can harm you if you are zealous for what is good?
</p><p class="hdg">Suffering for Righteousness</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. “Do not fear what they fear; do not be shaken.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But in your hearts sanctify Christ as Lord.<span class="fn">c</span>  Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you the reason for the hope that is in you. But respond with gentleness and respect,
<span class="reftext">16</span>keeping a clear conscience, so that those who slander you may be put to shame by your good behavior in Christ.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>For Christ also suffered<span class="fn">d</span>  for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit,
<span class="reftext">19</span>in whom<span class="fn">e</span>  He also went and preached to the spirits in prison
<span class="reftext">20</span>who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. </p><p class="reg1"> In the ark a few people, only eight souls, were saved through water.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And this water symbolizes the baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body, but the pledge of<span class="fn">f</span>  a clear conscience toward God—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
<span class="reftext">22</span>who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers subject to Him.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Psalm 34:12–16 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">“Do not fear their threats; do not be shaken.”</i> Isaiah 8:12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts.</i> This sentence may also be included with the quotation from the previous verse; see Isaiah 8:13.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> NE and WH <i class="calibre6">died</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the spirit, <span class="fnv">19</span>in which</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">appeal for</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
