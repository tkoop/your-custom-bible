<font ><b>The Day of Atonement</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the LORD spoke to Moses after the
death of two of Aaron’s sons when they approached the presence of
the LORD. And the LORD said to Moses: “Tell your brother Aaron not
to enter freely into the Most Holy Place behind the veil in front of
the mercy seat on the ark, or else he will die, because I appear in
the cloud above the mercy seat. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is how Aaron is to enter the Holy
Place: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt
offering. He is to wear the sacred linen tunic, with linen
undergarments. He must tie a linen sash around him and put on the
linen turban. These are holy garments, and he must bathe himself with
water before he wears them. And he shall take from the congregation
of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt
offering. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Aaron is to present the bull for his sin
offering and make atonement for himself and his household. Then he
shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Aaron casts lots for the two goats,
one for the LORD and the other for the scapegoat, he shall present
the goat chosen by lot for the LORD and sacrifice it as a sin
offering. But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be
presented alive before the LORD to make atonement by sending it into
the wilderness as the scapegoat. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Aaron presents the bull for his sin
offering and makes atonement for himself and his household, he is to
slaughter the bull for his own sin offering. Then he must take a
censer full of burning coals from the altar before the LORD, and two
handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense, and take them inside the
veil. He is to put the incense on the fire before the LORD, and the
cloud of incense will cover the mercy seat above the Testimony, so
that he will not die. And he is to take some of the bull’s blood
and sprinkle it with his finger on the east side of the mercy seat;
then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before
the mercy seat. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Aaron shall then slaughter the goat for
the sin offering for the people and bring its blood behind the veil,
and with its blood he must do as he did with the bull’s blood: He
is to sprinkle it against the mercy seat and in front of it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he shall make atonement for the Most
Holy Place because of the impurities and rebellious acts of the
Israelites in regard to all their sins. He is to do the same for the
Tent of Meeting which abides among them, because it is surrounded by
their impurities. No one may be in the Tent of Meeting from the time
Aaron goes in to make atonement in the Most Holy Place until he
leaves, after he has made atonement for himself, his household, and
the whole assembly of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he shall go out to the altar that is
before the LORD and make atonement for it. He is to take some of the
bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on all the
horns of the altar. He is to sprinkle some of the blood on it with
his finger seven times to cleanse it and consecrate it from the
uncleanness of the Israelites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Aaron has finished purifying the Most
Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he is to bring
forward the live goat. Then he is to lay both hands on the head of
the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities and rebellious
acts of the Israelites in regard to all their sins. He is to put them
on the goat’s head and send it away into the wilderness by the hand
of a man appointed for the task. The goat will carry on itself all
their iniquities into a solitary place, and the man will release it
into the wilderness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Aaron is to enter the Tent of
Meeting, take off the linen garments he put on before entering the
Most Holy Place, and leave them there. He is to bathe himself with
water in a holy place and put on his own clothes. Then he must go out
and sacrifice his burnt offering and the people’s burnt offering to
make atonement for himself and for the people. He is also to burn the
fat of the sin offering on the altar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The man who released the goat as the
scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water;
afterward he may reenter the camp. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The bull for the sin offering and the goat
for the sin offering, whose blood was brought into the Most Holy
Place to make atonement, must be taken outside the camp; and their
hides, flesh, and dung must be burned up. The one who burns them must
wash his clothes and bathe himself with water, and afterward he may
reenter the camp. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is to be a permanent statute for you:
On the tenth day of the seventh month, you shall humble yourselves
and not do any work—whether the native or the foreigner who resides
among you— because on this day atonement will be made for you to
cleanse you, and you will be clean from all your sins before the
LORD. It is a Sabbath of complete rest for you, that you may humble
yourselves; it is a permanent statute. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The priest who is anointed and ordained to
succeed his father as high priest shall make atonement. He will put
on the sacred linen garments and make atonement for the Most Holy
Place, the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, and for the priests and
all the people of the assembly. This is to be a permanent statute for
you, to make atonement once a year for the Israelites because of all
their sins.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And all this was done as the LORD had
commanded Moses. </font>
