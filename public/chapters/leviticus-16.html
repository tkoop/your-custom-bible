<span class="reftext">2</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses: “Tell your brother Aaron not to enter freely into the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span><span class="fn">a</span>  behind the veil in front of the mercy seat<span class="fn">b</span>  on the ark, or else he will die, because I appear in the cloud above the mercy seat.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>This is how Aaron is to enter the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span>: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.
<span class="reftext">4</span>He is to wear the sacred linen tunic, with linen undergarments. He must tie a linen sash around him and put on the linen turban. These are holy garments, and he must bathe himself with water before he wears them.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And he shall take from the congregation of Israel two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Aaron is to present the bull for his sin offering and make atonement for himself and his household.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then he shall take the two goats and present them before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> at the entrance to the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>After Aaron casts lots for the two goats, one for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and the other for the scapegoat,<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">9</span>he shall present the goat chosen by lot for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and sacrifice it as a sin offering.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to make atonement by sending it into the wilderness as the scapegoat.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>When Aaron presents the bull for his sin offering and makes atonement for himself and his household, he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then he must take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense, and take them inside the veil.
<span class="reftext">13</span>He is to put the incense on the fire before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and the cloud of incense will cover the mercy seat above the <span class='cap'>Testimony</span><span class='nocap'>testimony</span>,<span class="fn">d</span>  so that he will not die.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he is to take some of the bull’s blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the east side of the mercy seat; then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the mercy seat.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Aaron shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and bring its blood behind the veil, and with its blood he must do as he did with the bull’s blood: He is to sprinkle it against the mercy seat and in front of it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So he shall make atonement for the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span> because of the impurities and rebellious acts of the Israelites in regard to all their sins. He is to do the same for the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span> which abides among them, because it is surrounded by their impurities.
<span class="reftext">17</span>No one may be in the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span> from the time Aaron goes in to make atonement in the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span> until he leaves, after he has made atonement for himself, his household, and the whole assembly of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then he shall go out to the altar that is before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and make atonement for it. He is to take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on all the horns of the altar.
<span class="reftext">19</span>He is to sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.

<span class="reftext">21</span>Then he is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities and rebellious acts of the Israelites in regard to all their sins. He is to put them on the goat’s head and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man appointed for the task.
<span class="reftext">22</span>The goat will carry on itself all their iniquities into a solitary place, and the man will release it into the wilderness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then Aaron is to enter the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span>, take off the linen garments he put on before entering the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span>, and leave them there.
<span class="reftext">24</span>He is to bathe himself with water in a holy place and put on his own clothes. Then he must go out and sacrifice his burnt offering and the people’s burnt offering to make atonement for himself and for the people.
<span class="reftext">25</span>He is also to burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.
