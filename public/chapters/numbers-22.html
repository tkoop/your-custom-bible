<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Balak Summons Balaam</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the Israelites <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> on and camped in the plains of Moab near the Jordan, across from Jericho.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and Moab was terrified of the people because they were numerous. Indeed, Moab dreaded the Israelites.
<span class="reftext">4</span>So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will devour everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” </p><p class="reg1"> Since Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time,
<span class="reftext">5</span>he sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the Euphrates<span class="fn">a</span>  in the land of his people. </p><p class="reg1">“Behold, a people has come out of Egypt,” said Balak. “They cover the face of the land and have settled next to me.
<span class="reftext">6</span>So please come now and put a curse on this people, because they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land; for I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>The elders of Moab and Midian departed with the fees for divination in hand. They came to Balaam and relayed to him the words of Balak.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>“Spend the night here,” Balaam replied, “and I will give you the answer that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> speaks to me.” So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:
<span class="reftext">11</span>‘Behold, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them away.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are not to curse this people, for they are blessed.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Balaam got up the next morning and said to Balak’s princes, “Go back to your homeland, because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has refused to let me go with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And the princes of Moab arose, returned to Balak, and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then Balak sent other princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first messengers.
<span class="reftext">16</span>They came to Balaam and said, “This is what Balak son of Zippor says: ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,
<span class="reftext">17</span>for I will <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> you richly and do whatever you say. So please come and put a curse on this people for me!’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>But Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, “If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything small or great to go beyond the command of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> my God.
<span class="reftext">19</span>So now, please stay here overnight as the others did, that I may find out what else <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has to tell me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to summon you, get up and go with them, but <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must only do what I tell you.”
<span class="reftext">21</span>So in the morning Balaam got up, saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.
</p><p class="hdg">The Angel and Balaam’s Donkey</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then God’s anger was kindled because Balaam was going along, and the angel<span class="fn">b</span>  of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When the donkey saw the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, she turned off the path and went into a field. So Balaam beat her to return her to the path.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> stood in a narrow passage between two vineyards, with walls on either side.
<span class="reftext">25</span>And the donkey saw the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and pressed herself against the wall, crushing Balaam’s foot against it. So he beat her once again.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>And the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn to the right or left.
<span class="reftext">27</span>When the donkey saw the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, she lay down under Balaam, and he became furious and beat her with his staff.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> opened the donkey’s mouth, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you that you have beaten me these three times?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Balaam answered the donkey, “You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>But the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not the donkey you have ridden all your life until today? Have I ever treated you this way before?” </p><p class="reg1">“No,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand. And Balaam bowed low and fell facedown.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>The angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> asked him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to oppose you, because your way is perverse<span class="fn">c</span>  before me.
<span class="reftext">33</span>The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, then by now I would surely have killed you and let her live.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>“I have sinned,” Balaam said to the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “for I did not <span class='spell ca'>realize</span><span class='spell gb'>realise</span><span class='spell us'>realize</span> that you were standing in the road to confront me. And now, if this is displeasing in your sight, I will go back home.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>But the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you are to speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite city on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.
<span class="reftext">37</span>And he said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why did you not come to me? Am I really not able to richly reward you?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>“See, I have come to you,” Balaam replied, “but can I say just anything? I must speak only the word that God puts in my mouth.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>So Balaam accompanied Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
<span class="reftext">40</span>Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and he gave portions to Balaam and the princes who were with him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>The next morning, Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal. From there he could see the outskirts of the camp of the people.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the River</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i>; here through the rest of chapter 22; corresponding pronouns may also be capitalized.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">32</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">reckless</i> or <i class="calibre6">contrary</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
