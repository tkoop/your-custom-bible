<span class="reftext">2</span>When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about this, he returned from Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel came to Rehoboam and said,
<span class="reftext">4</span>“Your father put a heavy yoke on us. But now you should lighten the burden of your father’s service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people departed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> advise me to respond to these people?” he asked.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and please them by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders; instead, he consulted the young men who had grown up with him and served him.
<span class="reftext">9</span>He asked them, “What message do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> advise that we send back to these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>The young men who had grown up with him replied, “This is how <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> should answer these people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you should make it lighter.’ This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist!
<span class="reftext">11</span>Whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> with whips, I will scourge you with scorpions.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>After three days, Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, since the king had said, “Come back to me on the third day.”
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam rejected the advice of the elders
<span class="reftext">14</span>and spoke to them as the young men had advised, saying, “Whereas my father made <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> yoke heavy,<span class="fn">a</span>  I will add to your yoke. Whereas my father scourged you with whips, I will scourge <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> with scorpions.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So the king did not listen to the people, and indeed this turn of events was from God, in order that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> might <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> the word that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.
</p><p class="hdg">The Kingdom Divided<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Kings 12:16–19)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When all Israel saw that the king had refused to listen to them, they answered<span class="fn">b</span>  the king: </p><p class="indent1stline">“What portion do we have in David, </p><p class="indent"> and what inheritance in the son of Jesse? </p><p class="indent1"> To your tents, O Israel! </p><p class="indent"> Look now to your own house, O David!” </p><p class="reg1"> So all the Israelites went home,
<span class="reftext">17</span>but Rehoboam still reigned over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then King Rehoboam sent out Hadoram,<span class="fn">c</span>  who was in charge of the forced <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>, but the Israelites stoned him to death. And King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste and escaped to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">19</span>So to this day Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX and many Hebrew manuscripts (see also 1 Kings 12:14); MT <i class="calibre6">Whereas I made your yoke heavy</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Syriac, Vulgate, and many Hebrew Manuscripts; MT <i class="calibre6">And all Israel, since the king had refused to listen to them, answered</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Hadoram</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Adoram</i> and <i class="calibre6">Adoniram</i>; see 2 Samuel 20:24 and 1 Kings 4:6.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
