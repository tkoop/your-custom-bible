<font face="Tahoma, serif">When I came to you, brothers, I did not
come with eloquence or wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony
about God. For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except
Jesus Christ and Him crucified. I came to you in weakness and fear,
and with much trembling. My message and my preaching were not with
persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s
power, so that your faith would not rest on men’s wisdom, but on
God’s power. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Among the mature, however, we speak a
message of wisdom—but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers
of this age, who are coming to nothing. No, we speak of the
mysterious and hidden wisdom of God, which He destined for our glory
before time began. None of the rulers of this age understood it. For
if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. Rather,
as it is written: </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Spirit searches all things, even the
deep things of God. For who among men knows the thoughts of man
except his own spirit within him? So too, no one knows the thoughts
of God except the Spirit of God. We have not received the spirit of
the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand
what God has freely given us. And this is what we speak, not in words
taught us by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit,
expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The natural man does not accept the things
that come from the Spirit of God. For they are foolishness to him,
and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually
discerned. The spiritual man judges all things, but he himself is not
subject to anyone’s judgment. “For who has known the mind of the
Lord, so as to instruct Him?” But we have the mind of Christ. </font>
