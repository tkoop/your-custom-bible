<span class="reftext">2</span>And David realized that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had highly exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And David took more wives in Jerusalem and became the father of more sons and daughters.
<span class="reftext">4</span>These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua,<span class="fn">a</span>  Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
<span class="reftext">5</span>Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,

</p><p class="hdg">Two Victories over the Philistines<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Samuel 5:17–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they all went in search of him; but David learned of this and went out to face them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim.
<span class="reftext">10</span>So David inquired of God, “Should I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” </p><p class="reg1">“Go,” replied the LORD, “for I will deliver them into your hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So David and his men went up to Baal-perazim, where he defeated the Philistines and said, “Like a bursting flood, God has burst out against my enemies by my hand.” So they called that place Baal-perazim.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">12</span>There the Philistines abandoned their gods, and David ordered that they be burned in the fire.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Once again the Philistines raided the valley.
<span class="reftext">14</span>So David again inquired of God, who answered him, “Do not march up after them, but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span>As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle, because this will mean that God has marched out before you to strike the camp of the Philistines.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So David did as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And David’s fame went out into every land, and the LORD caused all nations to fear him.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Shammua</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Shimea</i>; see 1 Chronicles 3:5.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Beeliada</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Eliada</i>; see 2 Samuel 5:16.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Baal-Perazim</i> means <i class="calibre6">The Lord Bursts Out</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">aspen trees</i> or <i class="calibre6">poplar trees</i>; also in verse 15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
