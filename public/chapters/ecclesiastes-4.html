<font ><b>The Evil of Oppression</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again I looked, and I considered all the
oppression taking place under the sun. I saw the tears of the
oppressed, and they had no comforter; the power lay in the hands of
their oppressors, and there was no comforter. So I admired the dead,
who had already died, above the living, who are still alive. But
better than both is he who has not yet existed, who has not seen the
evil that is done under the sun. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I saw that all labor and success spring
from a man’s envy of his neighbor. This too is futile and a pursuit
of the wind. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >The fool folds his hands </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and consumes his own flesh. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Better one handful with tranquility </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >than two handfuls with toil and pursuit of
the wind. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again, I saw futility under the sun. There
is a man all alone, without even a son or brother. And though there
is no end to his labor, his eyes are still not content with his
wealth: “For whom do I toil and bereave my soul of enjoyment?”
This too is futile—a miserable task. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Two are better than one, because they have
a good return for their labor. For if one falls down, his companion
can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to help
him up! Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm; but how
can one keep warm alone? And though one may be overpowered, two can
resist. Moreover, a cord of three strands is not quickly broken. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Better is a poor but wise youth than an
old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take a warning. For
the youth has come from the prison to the kingship, though he was
born poor in his own kingdom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I saw that all who lived and walked under
the sun followed this second one, the youth who succeeded the king.
There is no limit to all the people who were before them. Yet the
successor will not be celebrated by those who come even later. This
too is futile and a pursuit of the wind. </font>
