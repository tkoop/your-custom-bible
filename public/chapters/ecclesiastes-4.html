I saw the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; the power lay in the hands of their oppressors, and there was no comforter.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So I admired the dead, who had already died, above the living, who are still alive.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But better than both is he who has not yet existed, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I saw that all labour and success spring from a man’s envy of his neighbour. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>The fool folds his hands </p><p class="indent"> and consumes his own flesh.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Better one handful with tranquillity </p><p class="indent"> than two handfuls with toil and pursuit of the wind.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Again, I saw futility under the sun.
<span class="reftext">8</span>There is a man all alone, without even a son or brother. And though there is no end to his labour, his eyes are still not content with his wealth: “For whom do I toil and bereave my soul of enjoyment?” This too is futile—a miserable task.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labour.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For if one falls down, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to help him up!
<span class="reftext">11</span>Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm; but how can one keep warm alone?
<span class="reftext">12</span>And though one may be overpowered, two can resist. Moreover, a cord of three strands is not quickly broken.
</p><p class="hdg">The Futility of Power</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take a warning.
<span class="reftext">14</span>For the youth has come from the prison to the kingship, though he was born poor in his own kingdom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed this second one, the youth who succeeded the king.
<span class="reftext">16</span>There is no limit to all the people who were before them. Yet the successor will not be celebrated by those who come even later. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
