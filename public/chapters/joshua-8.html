<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font ><b>The Conquest of Ai</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be
afraid or discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and
attack Ai. See, I have delivered into your hand the king of Ai, his
people, his city, and his land. And you shall do to Ai and its king
as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off
their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set up an ambush behind
the city.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Joshua and the whole army set out to
attack Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 mighty men of valor and sent them out
at night with these orders: “Pay attention. You are to lie in
ambush behind the city, not too far from it. All of you must be
ready. Then I and all the troops with me will advance on the city.
When they come out against us as they did the first time, we will
flee from them. They will pursue us until we have drawn them away
from the city, for they will say, ‘The Israelites are running away
from us as they did before.’ So as we flee from them, you are to
rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the LORD your God will
deliver it into your hand. And when you have taken the city, set it
on fire. Do as the LORD has commanded! See, I have given you orders.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Joshua sent them out, and they went to
the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the
west of Ai. But Joshua spent that night among the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Joshua got up early the next morning and
mobilized his men, and he and the elders of Israel marched before
them up to Ai. Then all the troops who were with him marched up and
approached the city. They arrived in front of Ai and camped to the
north of it, with the valley between them and the city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now Joshua had taken about five thousand
men and set up an ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the
city. So the forces were stationed with the main camp to the north of
the city and the rear guard to the west of the city. And that night
Joshua went into the valley. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When the king of Ai saw the Israelites, he
hurried out early in the morning with the men of the city to engage
them in battle at an appointed place overlooking the Arabah. But he
did not know that an ambush had been set up against him behind the
city. Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten back before
them, and they fled toward the wilderness. Then all the men of Ai
were summoned to pursue them, and they followed Joshua and were drawn
away from the city. Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go
out after Israel, leaving the city wide open while they pursued
Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Hold out
your battle lance toward Ai, for into your hand I will deliver the
city.” So Joshua held out his battle lance toward Ai, and as soon
as he did so, the men in ambush rose quickly from their position.
They rushed forward, entered the city, captured it, and immediately
set it on fire. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When the men of Ai turned and looked back,
the smoke of the city was rising into the sky. They could not escape
in any direction, and the troops who had fled to the wilderness now
became the pursuers. When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in
ambush had captured the city and that smoke was rising from it, they
turned around and struck down the men of Ai. Meanwhile, those in the
ambush came out of the city against them, and the men of Ai were
trapped between the Israelite forces on both sides. So Israel struck
them down until no survivor or fugitive remained. But they took the
king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Israel had finished killing all the
men of Ai who had pursued them into the field and wilderness, and
when every last one of them had fallen by the sword, all the
Israelites returned to Ai and put it to the sword as well. A total of
twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai.
Joshua did not draw back the hand that held his battle lance until he
had devoted to destruction all who lived in Ai. Israel took for
themselves only the cattle and plunder of that city, as the LORD had
commanded Joshua. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Joshua burned Ai and made it a
permanent heap of ruins, a desolation to this day. He hung the king
of Ai on a tree until evening, and at sunset Joshua commanded that
they take down the body from the tree and throw it down at the
entrance of the city gate. And over it they raised a large pile of
rocks, which remains to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >At that time Joshua built an altar on
Mount Ebal to the LORD, the God of Israel, just as Moses the servant
of the LORD had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to
what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: “an altar of uncut
stones on which no iron tool has been used.” And on it they offered
burnt offerings to the LORD, and they sacrificed peace offerings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And there in the presence of the
Israelites, Joshua inscribed on the stones a copy of the law of
Moses, which he had written. All Israel, foreigners and citizens
alike, with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on both sides
of the ark of the covenant of the LORD facing the Levitical priests
who carried it. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim
and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the
LORD had commanded earlier, to bless the people of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Afterward, Joshua read aloud all the words
of the law—the blessings and the curses—according to all that is
written in the Book of the Law. There was not a word of all that
Moses had commanded that Joshua failed to read before the whole
assembly of Israel, including the women, the little ones, and the
foreigners who lived among them. </font>
