<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font ><b>The Queen of Sheba</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now when the queen of Sheba heard about
the fame of Solomon, she came to test him with difficult questions.
She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan—with camels
bearing spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So she came to Solomon and spoke with him
about all that was on her mind. And Solomon answered all her
questions; nothing was too difficult for him to explain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of
Solomon, the palace he had built, the food at his table, the seating
of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and
cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of the
LORD, it took her breath away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >She said to the king, “The report I
heard in my own country about your words and wisdom is true. But I
did not believe the reports until I came and saw with my own eyes.
Indeed, not half of the greatness of your wisdom was told to me. You
have far exceeded the report I heard. How blessed are your men! How
blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you
and hear your wisdom! Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted
in you to set you on His throne to be king for the LORD your God.
Because your God loved Israel enough to establish them forever, He
has made you king over them to carry out justice and righteousness.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then she gave the king 120 talents of
gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There had
never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King
Solomon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >(The servants of Hiram and of Solomon who
brought gold from Ophir also brought algum wood and precious stones.
The king made the algum wood into steps for the house of the LORD and
for the king’s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers.
Never before had anything like them been seen in the land of Judah.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all
she desired—whatever she asked—far more than she had brought the
king. Then she left and returned to her own country, along with her
servants. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The weight of gold that came to Solomon
each year was 666 talents, not including the revenue from the
merchants and traders. And all the Arabian kings and governors of the
land also brought gold and silver to Solomon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >King Solomon made two hundred large
shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went
into each shield. He also made three hundred small shields of
hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.
And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Additionally, the king made a great throne
of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold. The throne had six steps,
and a footstool of gold was attached to it. There were armrests on
both sides of the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest.
Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step.
Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All King Solomon’s drinking cups were
gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were
pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing
in the days of Solomon. For the king had the ships of Tarshish that
went with Hiram’s servants, and once every three years the ships of
Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and
peacocks. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of
the earth in riches and wisdom. All the kings of the earth sought an
audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his
heart. Year after year, each visitor would bring his tribute:
articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and
mules. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and
chariots, and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities
and also with him in Jerusalem. He reigned over all the kings from
the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of
Egypt. The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and
cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills. Solomon’s horses
were imported from Egypt and from all the lands. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Solomon,
from beginning to end, are they not written in the Records of Nathan
the Prophet, in the Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the
Visions of Iddo the Seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat? Solomon
reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. And Solomon rested
with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. And
his son Rehoboam reigned in his place. </font>
