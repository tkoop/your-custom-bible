<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Queen of Sheba<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Kings 10:1–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon, she came to test him with difficult questions. She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan—with camels bearing spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. </p><p class="reg1"> So she came to Solomon and spoke with him about all that was on her mind.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for him to explain.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built,
<span class="reftext">4</span>the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants and cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he presented<span class="fn">a</span>  at the house of the LORD, it took her breath away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words<span class="fn">b</span>  and wisdom is true.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But I did not believe the reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not half of the greatness of your wisdom was told to me. You have far exceeded the report I heard.
<span class="reftext">7</span>How blessed are your men! How blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!
<span class="reftext">8</span>Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you to set you on His throne to be king for the LORD your God. Because your God loved Israel enough to establish them forever, He has made you king over them to carry out justice and righteousness.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold,<span class="fn">c</span>  a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>(The servants of Hiram and of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought algum<span class="fn">d</span>  wood and precious stones.
<span class="reftext">11</span>The king made the algum wood into steps<span class="fn">e</span>  for the house of the LORD and for the king’s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers. Never before had anything like them been seen in the land of Judah.)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired—whatever she asked—far more than she had brought the king. Then she left and returned to her own country, along with her servants.
</p><p class="hdg">Solomon’s Wealth and Splendor<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Kings 10:14–29)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was 666 talents,<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">14</span>not including the revenue from the merchants and traders. And all the Arabian kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold<span class="fn">g</span>  went into each shield.
<span class="reftext">16</span>He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold<span class="fn">h</span>  went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
<span class="reftext">18</span>The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>All King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.
<span class="reftext">21</span>For the king had the ships of Tarshish<span class="fn">i</span>  that went with Hiram’s<span class="fn">j</span>  servants, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.<span class="fn">k</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
<span class="reftext">23</span>All the kings of the earth sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Year after year, each visitor would bring his tribute: articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horses,<span class="fn">l</span>  which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">26</span>He reigned over all the kings from the Euphrates<span class="fn">m</span>  to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">27</span>The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills.<span class="fn">n</span> 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from all the lands.
</p><p class="hdg">The Death of Solomon<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Kings 11:41–43)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>As for the rest of the acts of Solomon, from beginning to end, are they not written in the Records of Nathan the Prophet, in the Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the Visions of Iddo the Seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?
<span class="reftext">30</span>Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
<span class="reftext">31</span>And Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. And his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX and Syriac (see also 1 Kings 10:5); Hebrew <i class="calibre6">and his stairway by which he went up</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">your achievements</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">120 talents</i> is approximately 4.52 tons or 4.1 metric tons of gold.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Algum</i> is probably a variant of <i class="calibre6">almug</i>; also in verse 11; see 1 Kings 10:11.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">gateways</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">666 talents</i> is approximately 25.1 tons or 22.8 metric tons of gold.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">600 shekels</i> is approximately 15.1 pounds or 6.8 kilograms of gold.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">300 shekels</i> is approximately 7.5 pounds or 3.4 kilograms of gold.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a fleet of trading ships</i>; twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Huram’s</i>, a variant of <i class="calibre6">Hiram’s</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Or <i class="calibre6">baboons</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> Or <i class="calibre6">horsemen</i> or <i class="calibre6">charioteers</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">m</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the River</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">n</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Shephelah</i> or <i class="calibre6">lowlands</i>; that is, the western foothills of Judea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
