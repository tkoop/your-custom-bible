<font><font face="Tahoma, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt"><b>Hebrews
11</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Faith and Assurance</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now faith is the assurance of what we hope
for and the certainty of what we do not see. This is why the ancients
were commended. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith we understand that the universe
was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out
of what was visible. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Abel offered God a better
sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous when
God gave approval to his gifts. And by faith he still speaks, even
though he is dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Enoch was taken up so that he did
not see death: “He could not be found, because God had taken him
away.” For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased
God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And without faith it is impossible to
please God, because anyone who approaches Him must believe that He
exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Noah, when warned about things
not yet seen, in godly fear built an ark to save his family. By faith
he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that
comes by faith. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Abraham, when called to go to a
place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went,
without knowing where he was going. By faith he dwelt in the promised
land as a stranger in a foreign country. He lived in tents, as did
Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. For he
was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and
builder is God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Sarah, even though she was barren
and beyond the proper age, was enabled to conceive a child, because
she considered Him faithful who had promised. And so from one man,
and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in
the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">All these people died in faith, without
having received the things they were promised. However, they saw them
and welcomed them from afar. And they acknowledged that they were
strangers and exiles on the earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now those who say such things show that
they are seeking a country of their own. If they had been thinking of
the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.
Instead, they were longing for a better country, a heavenly one.
Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has
prepared a city for them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Abraham, when he was tested,
offered up Isaac on the altar. He who had received the promises was
ready to offer his one and only son, even though God had said to him,
“Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.” Abraham reasoned
that God could raise the dead, and in a sense, he did receive Isaac
back from death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
concerning the future. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed
each of Joseph’s sons and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his
staff. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Joseph, when his end was near,
spoke about the exodus of the Israelites and gave instructions about
his bones. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Moses’ parents hid him for
three months after his birth, because they saw that he was a
beautiful child, and they were unafraid of the king’s edict. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Moses, when he was grown, refused
to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. He chose to suffer
oppression with God’s people rather than to experience the fleeting
enjoyment of sin. He valued disgrace for Christ above the treasures
of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his reward. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith Moses left Egypt, not fearing the
king’s anger; he persevered because he saw Him who is invisible. By
faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the
destroyer of the firstborn would not touch Israel’s own firstborn. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith the people passed through the Red
Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to follow, they were
drowned. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after
the people had marched around them for seven days. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she
welcomed the spies in peace, did not perish with those who were
disobedient. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And what more shall I say? Time will not
allow me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel,
and the prophets, who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered
justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions,
quenched the raging fire, and escaped the edge of the sword; who
gained strength from weakness, became mighty in battle, and put
foreign armies to flight. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Women received back their dead, raised to
life again. Others were tortured and refused their release, so that
they might gain a better resurrection. Still others endured mocking
and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They were stoned, they were sawed in two,
they were put to death by the sword. They went around in sheepskins
and goatskins, destitute, oppressed, and mistreated. The world was
not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and hid
in caves and holes in the ground. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">These were all commended for their faith,
yet they did not receive what was promised. God had planned something
better for us, so that together with us they would be made perfect. </font>
