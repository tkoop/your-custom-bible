15</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Seventh Year</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At the end of every seven years you must
cancel debts. This is the manner of remission: Every creditor shall
cancel what he has loaned to his neighbor. He is not to collect
anything from his neighbor or brother, because the LORD’s time of
release has been proclaimed. You may collect something from a
foreigner, but you must forgive whatever your brother owes you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">There will be no poor among you, however,
because the LORD will surely bless you in the land that the LORD your
God is giving you to possess as an inheritance, if only you obey the
LORD your God and are careful to follow all these commandments I am
giving you today. When the LORD your God blesses you as He has
promised, you will lend to many nations but borrow from none; you
will rule over many nations but be ruled by none. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If there is a poor man among your brothers
within any of the gates in the land that the LORD your God is giving
you, then you are not to harden your heart or shut your hand from
your poor brother. Instead, you are to open your hand to him and
freely loan him whatever he needs. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Be careful not to harbor this wicked
thought in your heart: “The seventh year, the year of release, is
near,” so that you look upon your poor brother begrudgingly and
give him nothing. He will cry out to the LORD against you, and you
will be guilty of sin. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Give generously to him, and do not let
your heart be grieved when you do so. And because of this the LORD
your God will bless you in all your work and in everything to which
you put your hand. For there will never cease to be poor in the land;
that is why I am commanding you to open wide your hand to your
brother and to the poor and needy in your land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If a fellow Hebrew, a man or a woman, is
sold to you and serves you six years, then in the seventh year you
must set him free. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when you release him, do not send him
away empty-handed. You are to furnish him liberally from your flock,
your threshing floor, and your winepress. You shall give to him as
the LORD your God has blessed you. Remember that you were slaves in
the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; that is why I
am giving you this command today. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But if your servant says to you, ‘I do
not want to leave you,’ because he loves you and your household and
is well off with you, then take an awl and pierce it through his ear
into the door, and he will become your servant for life. And treat
your maidservant the same way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not regard it as a hardship to set your
servant free, because his six years of service were worth twice the
wages of a hired hand. And the LORD your God will bless you in all
you do. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You must set apart to the LORD your God
every firstborn male produced by your herds and flocks. You are not
to put the firstborn of your oxen to work, nor are you to shear the
firstborn of your flock. Each year you and your household are to eat
it before the LORD your God in the place the LORD will choose. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But if an animal has a defect, is lame or
blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the LORD
your God. Eat it within your gates; both the ceremonially unclean and
clean may eat it as they would a gazelle or a deer. But you must not
eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water. </font>
