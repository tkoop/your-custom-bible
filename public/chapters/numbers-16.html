<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Korah’s Rebellion</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath son of Levi, along with some Reubenites—Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth—conducted
<span class="reftext">2</span>a rebellion against Moses, along with 250 men of Israel renowned as leaders of the congregation and representatives in the assembly.
<span class="reftext">3</span>They came together against Moses and Aaron and told them, “You have taken too much upon yourselves!<span class="fn">a</span>  For everyone in the entire congregation is holy, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is in their midst. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then he said to Korah and all his followers, “Tomorrow morning <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will reveal who belongs to Him<span class="fn">b</span>  and who is holy, and He will bring that person near to Himself. The one He chooses, He will bring near to Himself.
<span class="reftext">6</span>You, Korah, and all your followers are to do as follows: Take censers,
<span class="reftext">7</span>and tomorrow you are to place fire and incense in them in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. Then the man <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> chooses will be the one who is holy. It is you sons of Levi who have taken too much upon yourselves!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Moses also said to Korah, “Now listen, you sons of Levi!
<span class="reftext">9</span>Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel and brought you near to Himself to perform the work at <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them?
<span class="reftext">10</span>He has brought you near, you and all your fellow Levites, but you are seeking the priesthood as well.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore, it is you and all your followers who have conspired against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>! As for Aaron, who is he that you should grumble against him?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come!
<span class="reftext">13</span>Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness? Must you also appoint yourself as ruler over us?
<span class="reftext">14</span>Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then Moses became very angry and said to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “Do not regard their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them or mistreated a single one of them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And Moses said to Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> tomorrow—you and they and Aaron.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Each man is to take his censer, place incense in it, and present it before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>—250 censers. You and Aaron are to present your censers as well.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
<span class="reftext">19</span>When Korah had gathered his whole assembly against them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> appeared to the whole congregation.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses and Aaron,
<span class="reftext">21</span>“Separate yourselves from this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man sins, will You be angry with the whole congregation?”
</p><p class="hdg">Moses Separates the People</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">24</span>“Tell the congregation to move away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>So Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And he warned the congregation, “Move away now from the tents of these wicked men. Do not touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>So they moved away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram had come out and stood at the entrances to their tents with their wives and children and infants.
</p><p class="hdg">The Earth Swallows Korah</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then Moses said, “This is how you will know that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has sent me to do all these things, for it was not my own doing:
<span class="reftext">29</span>If these men die a natural death, or if they suffer the fate of all men, then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has not sent me.
<span class="reftext">30</span>But if <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> brings about something unprecedented, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them and all that belongs to them so that they go down alive into Sheol, then you will know that these men have treated <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> with contempt.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>As soon as Moses had finished saying all this, the ground beneath them split open,
<span class="reftext">32</span>and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households—all Korah’s men and all their possessions.
<span class="reftext">33</span>They went down alive into Sheol with all they owned. The earth closed over them, and they vanished from the assembly.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>At their cries, all the people of Israel who were around them fled, saying, “The earth may swallow us too!”
<span class="reftext">35</span>And fire came forth from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.
</p><p class="hdg">The Censers Reserved for Holy Use</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">37</span>“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to remove the censers from the flames and to scatter the coals far away, because the censers are holy.
<span class="reftext">38</span>As for the censers of those who sinned at the cost of their own lives, hammer them into sheets to overlay the altar, for these were presented before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and so have become holy. They will serve as a sign to the Israelites.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,
<span class="reftext">40</span>just as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> commanded him through Moses. This was to be a reminder to the Israelites that no outsider who is not a descendant of Aaron should approach to offer incense before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, lest he become like Korah and his followers.
</p><p class="hdg">Murmuring and Plague<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Corinthians 10:1–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>The next day the whole congregation of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s people!”
<span class="reftext">42</span>But when the congregation gathered against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the Tent of Meeting, and suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> appeared.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting,
<span class="reftext">44</span>and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">45</span>“Get away from this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant.” And Moses and Aaron fell facedown.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, place fire from the altar in it, and add incense. Go quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, because wrath has come out from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>; the plague has begun.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>So Aaron took the censer as Moses had ordered and ran into the midst of the assembly. And seeing that the plague had begun among the people, he offered the incense and made atonement for the people.
<span class="reftext">48</span>He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague was halted.
<span class="reftext">49</span>But those who died from the plague numbered 14,700, in addition to those who had died on account of Korah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, since the plague had been halted.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Figuratively <i class="calibre6">You have gone too far</i> or <i class="calibre6">You have appropriated too much authority to yourselves</i>; similarly in verse 7<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">God has visited and knows those who are His</i>; cited in 2 Timothy 2:19<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
