<font ><b>Korah’s Rebellion</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath
son of Levi, along with some Reubenites—Dathan and Abiram, sons of
Eliab, and On son of Peleth—conducted a rebellion against Moses,
along with 250 men of Israel renowned as leaders of the congregation
and representatives in the assembly. They came together against Moses
and Aaron and told them, “You have taken too much upon yourselves!
For everyone in the entire congregation is holy, and the LORD is in
their midst. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of
the LORD?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.
Then he said to Korah and all his followers, “Tomorrow morning the
LORD will reveal who belongs to Him and who is holy, and He will
bring that person near to Himself. The one He chooses, He will bring
near to Himself. You, Korah, and all your followers are to do as
follows: Take censers, and tomorrow you are to place fire and incense
in them in the presence of the LORD. Then the man the LORD chooses
will be the one who is holy. It is you sons of Levi who have taken
too much upon yourselves!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses also said to Korah, “Now listen,
you sons of Levi! Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has
separated you from the congregation of Israel and brought you near to
Himself to perform the work at the LORD’s tabernacle, and to stand
before the congregation to minister to them? He has brought you near,
you and all your fellow Levites, but you are seeking the priesthood
as well. Therefore, it is you and all your followers who have
conspired against the LORD! As for Aaron, who is he that you should
grumble against him?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the
sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come! Is it not enough
that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey
to kill us in the wilderness? Must you also appoint yourself as ruler
over us? Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with
milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards.
Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses became very angry and said to
the LORD, “Do not regard their offering. I have not taken one
donkey from them or mistreated a single one of them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Moses said to Korah, “You and all
your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow—you and they
and Aaron. Each man is to take his censer, place incense in it, and
present it before the LORD—250 censers. You and Aaron are to
present your censers as well.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So each man took his censer, put fire and
incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the
Tent of Meeting. When Korah had gathered his whole assembly against
them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of the LORD
appeared to the whole congregation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
“Separate yourselves from this congregation so that I may consume
them in an instant.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and
said, “O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, when one man
sins, will You be angry with the whole congregation?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell the
congregation to move away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and
Abiram.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses got up and went to Dathan and
Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. And he warned the
congregation, “Move away now from the tents of these wicked men. Do
not touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be swept away
because of all their sins.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they moved away from the dwellings of
Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram had come out
and stood at the entrances to their tents with their wives and
children and infants. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses said, “This is how you will
know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things, for it was not
my own doing: If these men die a natural death, or if they suffer the
fate of all men, then the LORD has not sent me. But if the LORD
brings about something unprecedented, and the earth opens its mouth
and swallows them and all that belongs to them so that they go down
alive into Sheol, then you will know that these men have treated the
LORD with contempt.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As soon as Moses had finished saying all
this, the ground beneath them split open, and the earth opened its
mouth and swallowed them and their households—all Korah’s men and
all their possessions. They went down alive into Sheol with all they
owned. The earth closed over them, and they vanished from the
assembly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At their cries, all the people of Israel
who were around them fled, saying, “The earth may swallow us too!”
And fire came forth from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were
offering the incense. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell
Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to remove the censers from the flames
and to scatter the coals far away, because the censers are holy. As
for the censers of those who sinned at the cost of their own lives,
hammer them into sheets to overlay the altar, for these were
presented before the LORD, and so have become holy. They will serve
as a sign to the Israelites.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Eleazar the priest took the bronze
censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them
hammered out to overlay the altar, just as the LORD commanded him
through Moses. This was to be a reminder to the Israelites that no
outsider who is not a descendant of Aaron should approach to offer
incense before the LORD, lest he become like Korah and his followers.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day the whole congregation of
Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed
the LORD’s people!” But when the congregation gathered against
them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the Tent of Meeting, and suddenly
the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of
the Tent of Meeting, and the LORD said to Moses, “Get away from
this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant.” And
Moses and Aaron fell facedown. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer,
place fire from the altar in it, and add incense. Go quickly to the
congregation and make atonement for them, because wrath has come out
from the LORD; the plague has begun.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Aaron took the censer as Moses had
ordered and ran into the midst of the assembly. And seeing that the
plague had begun among the people, he offered the incense and made
atonement for the people. He stood between the living and the dead,
and the plague was halted. But those who died from the plague
numbered 14,700, in addition to those who had died on account of
Korah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Aaron returned to Moses at the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting, since the plague had been halted. </font>
