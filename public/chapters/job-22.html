</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Can a man be of use to God? </p><p class="indent"> Can even a wise man benefit Him?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Does it delight the Almighty that you are righteous? </p><p class="indent"> Does He profit if your ways are blameless?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Is it for your reverence that He rebukes you </p><p class="indent"> and enters into <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> against you?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Is not your wickedness great? </p><p class="indent"> Are not your iniquities endless?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>For you needlessly demanded security from your brothers </p><p class="indent"> and deprived the naked of their clothing.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>You gave no water to the weary </p><p class="indent"> and withheld food from the famished,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>while the land belonged to a mighty man, </p><p class="indent"> and a man of <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> lived on it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>You sent widows away empty-handed, </p><p class="indent"> and the strength of the fatherless was crushed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore snares surround you, </p><p class="indent"> and sudden peril terrifies you;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>it is so dark you cannot see, </p><p class="indent"> and a flood of water covers you.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>Is not God as high as the heavens? </p><p class="indent"> Look at the highest stars, how lofty they are!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Yet you say: ‘What does God know? </p><p class="indent"> Does He judge through thick darkness?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thick clouds veil Him so He does not see us </p><p class="indent"> as He traverses the vault of heaven.<span class="fn">a</span>’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>Will you stay on the ancient path </p><p class="indent"> that wicked men have trod?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>They were snatched away before their time, </p><p class="indent"> and their foundations were swept away by a flood.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>They said to God, ‘Depart from us. </p><p class="indent"> What can the Almighty do to us?’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>But it was He who filled their houses with good things; </p><p class="indent"> so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>The righteous see it and are glad; </p><p class="indent"> the innocent mock them:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>‘Surely our foes are destroyed, </p><p class="indent"> and fire has consumed their excess.’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>Reconcile now and be at peace with Him; </p><p class="indent"> thereby good will come to you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Receive instruction from His mouth, </p><p class="indent"> and lay up His words in your heart.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored. </p><p class="indent"> If you remove injustice from your tents
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>and consign your gold to the dust </p><p class="indent"> and the gold of Ophir to the stones of the ravines,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>then the Almighty will be your gold </p><p class="indent"> and the finest silver for you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Surely then you will delight in the Almighty </p><p class="indent"> and lift up your face to God.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>You will pray to Him, and He will hear you, </p><p class="indent"> and you will <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> your vows.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Your decisions will be carried out, </p><p class="indent"> and light will shine on your ways.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>When men are brought low and you say, ‘Lift them up!’ </p><p class="indent"> then He will save the lowly.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>He will deliver even one who is not innocent, </p><p class="indent"> rescuing him through the cleanness of your hands.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">heaven’s horizon</i> or <i class="calibre6">the circle of the sky</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
