<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Dead to Sin, Alive to God<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Corinthians 4:7–18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may increase?
<span class="reftext">2</span>Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live in it any longer?
<span class="reftext">3</span>Or aren’t <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> aware that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> death?
<span class="reftext">4</span>We were therefore buried with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> through baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, we too may walk in newness of life.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>For if we have been united with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> like this in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> death, we will certainly also be united with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> resurrection.
<span class="reftext">6</span>We know that our old self was crucified with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For anyone who has died has been freed from sin.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">9</span>For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> cannot die again; death no longer has dominion over <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">10</span>The death <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> died, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> died to sin once for all; but the life <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> lives, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> lives to God.
<span class="reftext">11</span>So <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> too must count yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore do not let sin reign in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> mortal body so that you obey its desires.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Do not present the parts of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> body to sin as instruments of wickedness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and present the parts of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> body to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> as instruments of righteousness.
<span class="reftext">14</span>For sin shall not be your master, because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are not under law, but under grace.
</p><p class="hdg">The Wages of Sin</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Certainly not!
<span class="reftext">16</span>Do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not know that when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> offer yourselves as obedient slaves, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are slaves to the one <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> obey, whether <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are slaves to sin leading to death, or to obedience leading to righteousness?
<span class="reftext">17</span>But thanks be to God that, though <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> once were slaves to sin, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were committed.
<span class="reftext">18</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> flesh. Just as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> used to offer the parts of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> body in slavery to impurity and to escalating wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>For when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were slaves to sin, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were free of obligation to righteousness.
<span class="reftext">21</span>What fruit did <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> reap at that time from the things of which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are now ashamed? The outcome of those things is death.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But now that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the fruit <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> reap leads to holiness, and the outcome is eternal life.
<span class="reftext">23</span>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
