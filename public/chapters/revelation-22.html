<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the angel showed me a river of the
water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God
and of the Lamb down the middle of the main street of the city. On
either side of the river stood a tree of life, bearing twelve kinds
of fruit and yielding a fresh crop for each month. And the leaves of
the tree are for the healing of the nations. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >No longer will there be any curse. The
throne of God and of the Lamb will be within the city, and His
servants will worship Him. They will see His face, and His name will
be on their foreheads. There will be no more night in the city, and
they will have no need for the light of a lamp or of the sun. For the
Lord God will shine on them, and they will reign forever and ever. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the angel said to me, “These words
are faithful and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the
prophets, has sent His angel to show His servants what must soon take
place.” </font>

<font >And I am John, who heard and saw these
things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at
the feet of the angel who had shown me these things. But he said to
me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your
brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this
book. Worship God!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he told me, “Do not seal up the
words of prophecy in this book, because the time is near. Let the
unrighteous continue to be unrighteous, and the vile continue to be
vile; let the righteous continue to practice righteousness, and the
holy continue to be holy.” </font>
