<font >Then the angel showed me a river of the
water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God
and of the Lamb down the middle of the main street of the city. On
either side of the river stood a tree of life, bearing twelve kinds
of fruit and yielding a fresh crop for each month. And the leaves of
the tree are for the healing of the nations. </font>

throne of God and of the Lamb will be within the city, and His
servants will worship Him. They will see His face, and His name will
be on their foreheads. There will be no more night in the city, and
they will have no need for the light of a lamp or of the sun. For the
Lord God will shine on them, and they will reign forever and ever. </font>
