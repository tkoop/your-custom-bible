<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The River of Life</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the angel showed me a river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
<span class="reftext">2</span>down the middle of the main street of the city. On either side of the river stood a tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit and yielding a fresh crop for each month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be within the city, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> servants will worship <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">4</span>They will see <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> face, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> name will be on their foreheads.
<span class="reftext">5</span>There will be no more night in the city, and they will have no need for the light of a lamp or of the sun. For the Lord God will shine on them, and they will reign forever and ever.

<span class="reftext">9</span>But he said to me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then he told me, “Do not seal up the words of prophecy in this book, because the time is near.
