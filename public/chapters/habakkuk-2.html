</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> answered me: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Write down this vision </p><p class="indent"> and clearly inscribe it on tablets, </p><p class="indent"> so that a herald may run with it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For the vision awaits an appointed time; </p><p class="indent"> it testifies of the end and does not lie. </p><p class="indent1"> Though it lingers, wait for it, </p><p class="indent"> since it will surely come and will not delay.<span class="fn">a</span>

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>and wealth<span class="fn">d</span>  indeed betrays him. </p><p class="indent">He is an arrogant man never at rest. </p><p class="indent1"> He enlarges his appetite like Sheol, </p><p class="indent"> and like Death, he is never satisfied. </p><p class="indent1"> He gathers all the nations to himself </p><p class="indent"> and collects all the peoples as his own.
</p><p class="hdg">Woe to the Chaldeans</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Will not all of these take up a taunt against him, </p><p class="indent"> speaking with mockery and derision: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Woe to him who amasses what is not his </p><p class="indent"> and makes himself rich with many loans! </p><p class="indent"> How long will this go on?’
