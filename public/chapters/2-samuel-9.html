<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">David and Mephibosheth</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then David asked, “Is there anyone left from the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for the sake of Jonathan?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And there was a servant of Saul’s family named Ziba. They summoned him to David, and the king inquired, “Are you Ziba?” </p><p class="reg1">“I am your servant,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So the king asked, “Is there anyone left of Saul’s family to whom I can show the kindness of God?” </p><p class="reg1"> Ziba answered, “There is still Jonathan’s son, who is lame in both feet.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“Where is he?” replied the king. </p><p class="reg1"> And Ziba said, “Indeed, he is in Lo-debar at the house of Machir son of Ammiel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So King David had him brought from the house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo-debar.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And when Mephibosheth<span class="fn">a</span>  son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he fell facedown in reverence. </p><p class="reg1"> Then David said, “Mephibosheth!” </p><p class="reg1">“I am your servant,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>“Do not be afraid,” said David, “for surely I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Mephibosheth bowed down and said, “What is your servant, that you should show regard for a dead dog like me?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then the king summoned Saul’s servant Ziba and said to him, “I have given to your master’s grandson all that belonged to Saul and to all his house.
<span class="reftext">10</span>You and your sons and servants are to work the ground for him and bring in the harvest, so that your master’s grandson may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, is always to eat at my table.” </p><p class="reg1"> Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do all that my lord the king has commanded.” </p><p class="reg1"> So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table<span class="fn">b</span>  like one of the king’s own sons.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica,<span class="fn">c</span>  and all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants of Mephibosheth.
<span class="reftext">13</span>So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king’s table, and he was lame in both feet.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Mephibosheth</i> is also called <i class="calibre6">Merib-baal</i>; see 1 Chronicles 8:34.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">my table</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Mica</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Micah</i>; see 1 Chronicles 8:34.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
