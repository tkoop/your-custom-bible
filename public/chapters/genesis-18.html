<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Three Visitors</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD appeared to Abraham by the
Oaks of Mamre in the heat of the day, while he was sitting at the
entrance of his tent. And Abraham looked up and saw three men
standing nearby. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his
tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">My lord,” said Abraham, “if I have
found favor in your sight, please do not pass your servant by. Let a
little water be brought, that you may wash your feet and rest
yourselves under the tree. And I will bring a bit of bread so that
you may refresh yourselves. This is why you have passed your
servant’s way. After that, you may continue on your way.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Yes,” they replied, “you may do as
you have said.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Abraham hurried into the tent and said
to Sarah, “Quick! Prepare three seahs of fine flour, knead it, and
bake some bread.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile, Abraham ran to the herd,
selected a tender and choice calf, and gave it to a servant, who
hurried to prepare it. Then Abraham brought curds and milk and the
calf that had been prepared, and he set them before the men and stood
by them under the tree as they ate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Where is your wife Sarah?” they
asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">There, in the tent,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said, “I will surely
return to you at this time next year, and your wife Sarah will have a
son!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Sarah was behind him, listening at the
entrance to the tent. And Abraham and Sarah were already old and well
along in years; Sarah had passed the age of childbearing. So she
laughed to herself, saying, “After I am worn out and my master is
old, will I now have this pleasure?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD asked Abraham, “Why did
Sarah laugh and say, ‘Can I really bear a child when I am old?’
Is anything too difficult for the LORD? At the appointed time I will
return to you—in about a year—and Sarah will have a son.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Sarah was afraid, so she denied it and
said, “I did not laugh.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">No,” replied the LORD, “but you did
laugh.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the men got up to leave, they looked
out over Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them off. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD said, “Shall I hide from
Abraham what I am about to do? Abraham will surely become a great and
powerful nation, and through him all the nations of the earth will be
blessed. For I have chosen him, so that he will command his children
and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what
is right and just, in order that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what
He has promised.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said, “The outcry against
Sodom and Gomorrah is great. Because their sin is so grievous, I will
go down to see if their actions fully justify the outcry that has
reached Me. If not, I will find out.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the two men turned away and went
toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Abraham stepped forward and said, “Will
You really sweep away the righteous with the wicked? What if there
are fifty righteous ones in the city? Will You really sweep it away
and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous ones who
are there? Far be it from You to do such a thing—to kill the
righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are
treated alike. Far be it from You! Will not the Judge of all the
earth do what is right?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the LORD replied, “If I find fifty
righteous ones within the city of Sodom, on their account I will
spare the whole place.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Abraham answered, “Now that I have
ventured to speak to the Lord—though I am but dust and ashes—
suppose the fifty righteous ones lack five. Will You destroy the
whole city for the lack of five?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He replied, “If I find forty-five there,
I will not destroy it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Once again Abraham spoke to the LORD,
“Suppose forty are found there?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He answered, “On account of the forty, I
will not do it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Abraham said, “May the Lord not be
angry, but let me speak further. Suppose thirty are found there?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He replied, “If I find thirty there, I
will not do it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Abraham said, “Now that I have
ventured to speak to the Lord, suppose twenty are found there?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He answered, “On account of the twenty,
I will not destroy it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Finally, Abraham said, “May the Lord not
be angry, but let me speak once more. Suppose ten are found there?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And He answered, “On account of the ten,
I will not destroy it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the LORD had finished speaking with
Abraham, He departed, and Abraham returned home. </font>
