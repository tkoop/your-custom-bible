<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Three Visitors</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> appeared to Abraham by the <span class='cap'>Oaks</span><span class='nocap'>oaks</span><span class="fn">a</span>  of Mamre in the heat of the day, while he was sitting at the entrance of his tent.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>“My lord,” said Abraham, “if I have found <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in your sight, please do not pass your servant by.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Let a little water be brought, that you may wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And I will bring a bit of bread so that you may refresh yourselves. This is why you have passed your servant’s way. After that, you may continue on your way.” </p><p class="reg1">“Yes,” they replied, “you may do as you have said.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick! Prepare three seahs of fine flour,<span class="fn">b</span>  knead it, and bake some bread.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Meanwhile, Abraham ran to the herd, selected a tender and choice calf, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Then Abraham brought curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and he set them before the men and stood by them under the tree as they ate.
</p><p class="hdg">Sarah Laughs at the Promise</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked. </p><p class="reg1">“There, in the tent,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, “I will surely return to you at this time next year, and your wife Sarah will have a son!” </p><p class="reg1"> Now Sarah was behind him, listening at the entrance to the tent.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Abraham and Sarah were already old and well along in years; Sarah had passed the age of childbearing.
<span class="reftext">12</span>So she laughed to herself, saying, “After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> asked Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Can I really bear a child when I am old?’
<span class="reftext">14</span>Is anything too difficult for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>? At the appointed time I will return to you—in about a year—and Sarah will have a son.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>But Sarah was afraid, so she denied it and said, “I did not laugh.” </p><p class="reg1">“No,” replied <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “but you did laugh.”
</p><p class="hdg">Abraham Intercedes for Sodom</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When the men got up to leave, they looked out over Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them off.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?
<span class="reftext">18</span>Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and through him all the nations of the earth will be blessed.
<span class="reftext">19</span>For I have chosen him, so that he will command his children and his household after him to keep the way of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> by doing what is right and just, in order that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> may bring upon Abraham what <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has promised.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great. Because their sin is so grievous,
<span class="reftext">21</span>I will go down to see if their actions fully justify the outcry that has reached <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>. If not, I will find out.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And the two men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Abraham stepped forward and said, “Will <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
<span class="reftext">24</span>What if there are fifty righteous ones in the city? Will <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous ones who are there?
<span class="reftext">25</span>Far be it from <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>! Will not the <span class='cap'>Judge</span><span class='nocap'>judge</span> of all the earth do what is right?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> replied, “If I find fifty righteous ones within the city of Sodom, on their account I will spare the whole place.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then Abraham answered, “Now that I have ventured to speak to the Lord—though I am but dust and ashes—
<span class="reftext">28</span>suppose the fifty righteous ones lack five. Will <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> destroy the whole city for the lack of five?” </p><p class="reg1"> He replied, “If I find forty-five there, I will not destroy it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Once again Abraham spoke to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “Suppose forty are found there?” </p><p class="reg1"> He answered, “On account of the forty, I will not do it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Then Abraham said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak further. Suppose thirty are found there?” </p><p class="reg1"> He replied, “If I find thirty there, I will not do it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>And Abraham said, “Now that I have ventured to speak to the Lord, suppose twenty are found there?” </p><p class="reg1"> He answered, “On account of the twenty, I will not destroy it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Finally, Abraham said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak once more. Suppose ten are found there?” </p><p class="reg1"> And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> answered, “On account of the ten, I will not destroy it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>When <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had finished speaking with Abraham, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> departed, and Abraham returned home.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Terebinths</i> or <i class="calibre6">Great Trees</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">3 seahs</i> is approximately 19.8 dry quarts or 21.9 liters (probably about 24.5 pounds or 11.1 kilograms of flour).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Cited in Romans 9:9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
