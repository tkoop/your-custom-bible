<span class="reftext">2</span>“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you.
<span class="reftext">3</span>For behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will restore from captivity<span class="fn">a</span>  My people Israel and Judah, declares the LORD. I will restore them to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Yes, this is what the LORD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“A cry of panic is heard—</p><p class="indent">a cry of terror, not of peace.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Ask now, and see: </p><p class="indent"> Can a male give birth? </p><p class="indent1"> Why then do I see every man </p><p class="indent"> with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labour </p><p class="indent"> and every face turned pale?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>How awful that day will be! </p><p class="indent"> None will be like it! </p><p class="indent1"> It is the time of Jacob’s distress, </p><p class="indent"> but he will be saved out of it.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>On that day, </p><p class="indent"> declares the LORD of Hosts, </p><p class="indent1"> I will break the yoke off their necks </p><p class="indent"> and tear off their bonds, </p><p class="indent"> and no longer will strangers enslave them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Instead, they will serve the LORD their God </p><p class="indent"> and David their king, </p><p class="indent"> whom I will raise up for them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>As for you, O Jacob My servant, do not be afraid, </p><p class="indent"> declares the LORD, </p><p class="indent1"> and do not be dismayed, </p><p class="indent"> O Israel. </p><p class="indent1"> For I will surely save you out of a distant place, </p><p class="indent"> your descendants from the land of their captivity! </p><p class="indent1"> Jacob will return to quiet and ease, </p><p class="indent"> with no one to make him afraid.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>For I am with you to save you, </p><p class="indent"> declares the LORD. </p><p class="indent1"> Though I will completely destroy all the nations to which I have scattered you, </p><p class="indent"> I will not completely destroy you. </p><p class="indent1"> Yet I will discipline you justly, </p><p class="indent"> and will by no means leave you unpunished.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>For this is what the LORD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Your injury is incurable; </p><p class="indent"> your wound is grievous.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>There is no one to plead your cause, </p><p class="indent"> no remedy for your sores, </p><p class="indent"> no recovery for you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>All your lovers have forgotten you; </p><p class="indent"> they no longer seek you, </p><p class="indent1"> for I have struck you as an enemy would, </p><p class="indent"> with the discipline of someone cruel, </p><p class="indent1"> because of your great iniquity </p><p class="indent"> and your numerous sins.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>Why do you cry out over your wound? </p><p class="indent"> Your pain has no cure! </p><p class="indent1"> Because of your great iniquity </p><p class="indent"> and your numerous sins </p><p class="indent"> I have done these things to you.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>Nevertheless, all who devour you will be devoured, </p><p class="indent"> and all your adversaries—every one of them—</p><p class="indent"> will go off into exile. </p><p class="indent1"> Those who plundered you will be plundered, </p><p class="indent"> and all who raided you will be raided.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>But I will restore your health and heal your wounds, </p><p class="indent"> declares the LORD, </p><p class="indent1"> because they call you an outcast, </p><p class="indent"> Zion, for whom no one cares.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>This is what the LORD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I will restore the fortunes of<span class="fn">b</span>  Jacob’s tents </p><p class="indent"> and have compassion on his dwellings. </p><p class="indent1"> And the city will be rebuilt on her own ruins, </p><p class="indent"> and the palace will stand in its rightful place.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Thanksgiving will proceed from them, </p><p class="indent"> a sound of celebration. </p><p class="indent1"> I will multiply them, and they will not be decreased; </p><p class="indent"> I will honour them, and they will not be belittled.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Their children will be as in days of old, </p><p class="indent"> and their congregation will be established before Me; </p><p class="indent"> and I will punish all their oppressors.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Their leader will be one of their own, </p><p class="indent"> and their ruler will arise from their midst. </p><p class="indent1"> And I will bring him near, and he will approach Me, </p><p class="indent"> for who would dare on his own to approach Me?” </p><p class="selah"> declares the LORD.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>“And you will be My people, </p><p class="indent"> and I will be your God.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>Behold, the storm of the LORD </p><p class="indent"> has gone out with fury, </p><p class="indent1"> a whirlwind swirling down </p><p class="indent"> upon the heads of the wicked.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back </p><p class="indent"> until He has fully accomplished the purposes of His heart. </p><p class="indent1"> In the days to come </p><p class="indent"> you will understand this.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">restore the fortunes of</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">restore from captivity</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
