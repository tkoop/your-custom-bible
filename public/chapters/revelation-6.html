<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The First Six Seals</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I watched as the Lamb opened one of
the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say in
a thunderous voice, “Come!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I looked and saw a white horse, and its
rider held a bow. And he was given a crown, and he rode out to
overcome and conquer. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when the Lamb opened the second seal,
I heard the second living creature say, “Come!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then another horse went forth. It was
bright red, and its rider was granted permission to take away peace
from the earth and to make men slay one another. And he was given a
great sword. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when the Lamb opened the third seal, I
heard the third living creature say, “Come!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I looked and saw a black horse, and
its rider held in his hand a pair of scales. And I heard what sounded
like a voice from among the four living creatures, saying, “A quart
of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius,
and do not harm the oil and wine.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when the Lamb opened the fourth seal,
I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I looked and saw a pale green horse.
Its rider’s name was Death, and Hades followed close behind. And
they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill by
sword, by famine, by plague, and by the beasts of the earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I
saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the
word of God and for the testimony they had upheld. And they cried out
in a loud voice, “How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You avenge
our blood and judge those who dwell upon the earth?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then each of them was given a white robe
and told to rest a little while longer, until the full number of
their fellow servants, their brothers, were killed, just as they had
been killed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when I saw the Lamb open the sixth
seal, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black like
sackcloth of goat hair, and the whole moon turned blood red, and the
stars of the sky fell to the earth like unripe figs dropping from a
tree shaken by a great wind. The sky receded like a scroll being
rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the kings of the earth, the nobles,
the commanders, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and free man
hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains. And they said
to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the
face of the One seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.
For the great day of Their wrath has come, and who is able to
withstand it?” </font>
