</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And Nathan replied to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
<span class="reftext">4</span>“Go and tell <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> servant David that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: You are not the one to build <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> a house in which to dwell.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt<span class="fn">a</span>  until this day, but I have moved from tent to tent and dwelling to dwelling.
<span class="reftext">6</span>In all <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever asked any of the leaders<span class="fn">b</span>  I appointed to shepherd <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people, ‘Why haven’t <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> built <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> a house of cedar?’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now then, you are to tell <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> servant David that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: I took you from the pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people Israel.
<span class="reftext">8</span>I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name like the greatest in the land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And I will provide a place for <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their own and be disturbed no more. No longer will the sons of wickedness oppress them as they did at the beginning
<span class="reftext">10</span>and have done since the day I appointed judges over <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies. </p><p class="reg1"> Moreover, I declare to you that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will build a house for you.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And when your days are fulfilled and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
<span class="reftext">12</span>He will build a house for <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, and I will establish his throne forever.
<span class="reftext">13</span>I will be his <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>, and he will be <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> son.

<span class="reftext">14</span>But I will set him over <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> house and <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.”
