<font ><b>God’s Covenant with David</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After David had settled into his palace,
he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of
cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Nathan replied to David, “Do all
that is in your heart, for God is with you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But that night the word of God came to
Nathan, saying, “Go and tell My servant David that this is what the
LORD says: You are not the one to build Me a house in which to dwell.
For I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out
of Egypt until this day, but I have moved from tent to tent and
dwelling to dwelling. In all My journeys with all the Israelites,
have I ever asked any of the leaders I appointed to shepherd My
people, ‘Why haven’t you built Me a house of cedar?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now then, you are to tell My servant David
that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I took you from the
pasture, from following the flock, to be the ruler over My people
Israel. I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut
off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make for you a name
like the greatest in the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And I will provide a place for My people
Israel and will plant them so that they may dwell in a place of their
own and be disturbed no more. No longer will the sons of wickedness
oppress them as they did at the beginning and have done since the day
I appointed judges over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your
enemies. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, I declare to you that the LORD
will build a house for you. And when your days are fulfilled and you
go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after
you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. He will
build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever. I will
be his Father, and he will be My son. And I will never remove My
loving devotion from him as I removed it from your predecessor. But I
will set him over My house and My kingdom forever, and his throne
will be established forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Nathan relayed to David all the words
of this entire vision. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then King David went in, sat before the
LORD, and said, “Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my house, that
You have brought me this far? And as if this was a small thing in
Your eyes, O God, You have spoken about the future of the house of
Your servant and have regarded me as a man of great distinction, O
LORD God. What more can David say to You for so honoring Your
servant? For You know Your servant, O LORD. For the sake of Your
servant and according to Your own heart, You have accomplished this
great thing and revealed all Your greatness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >O LORD, there is none like You, and there
is no God but You, according to everything we have heard with our own
ears. And who is like Your people Israel—the one nation on earth
whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself? You made a name
for Yourself through great and awesome wonders by driving out nations
from before Your people, whom You redeemed from Egypt. For You have
made Your people Israel Your very own forever, and You, O LORD, have
become their God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now, O LORD, let the word You have
spoken concerning Your servant and his house be established forever.
Do as You have promised, so that Your name will be established and
magnified forever when it is said, ‘The LORD of Hosts, the God of
Israel, is God over Israel.’ And may the house of Your servant
David be established before You. For You, my God, have revealed to
Your servant that You will build a house for him. Therefore Your
servant has found the courage to pray before You. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now, O LORD, You are God! And You have
promised this goodness to Your servant. So now You have been pleased
to bless the house of Your servant, that it may continue forever
before You. For You, O LORD, have blessed it, and it will be blessed
forever.” </font>
