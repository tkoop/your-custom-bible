<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jesus had concluded His discourse in
the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum. There a highly
valued servant of a centurion was sick and about to die. When the
centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to ask Him to
come and heal his servant. They came to Jesus and pleaded with Him
earnestly, “This man is worthy to have You grant this, for he loves
our nation and has built our synagogue.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jesus went with them. But when He was
not far from the house, the centurion sent friends with the message:
“Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy to have You
come under my roof. That is why I did not consider myself worthy to
come to You. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell
one to go, and he goes; and another to come, and he comes. I tell my
servant to do something, and he does it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jesus heard this, He marveled at the
centurion. Turning to the crowd following Him, He said, <font color="#a80000">“I
tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.”</font>
And when the messengers returned to the house, they found the servant
in good health. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town
called Nain. His disciples went with Him, accompanied by a large
crowd. As He approached the town gate, He saw a dead man being
carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a
large crowd from the town was with her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the Lord saw her, He had compassion
on her and said, <font color="#a80000">“Do not weep.”</font> Then
He went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still.
<font color="#a80000">“Young man,”</font> He said, <font color="#a80000">“I
tell you, get up!”</font> And the dead man sat up and began to
speak! Then Jesus gave him back to his mother. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">A sense of awe swept over all of them, and
they glorified God. “A great prophet has appeared among us!” they
said. “God has visited His people!” And the news about Jesus
spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding region. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then John’s disciples informed him about
all these things. So John called two of his disciples and sent them
to ask the Lord, “Are You the One who was to come, or should we
look for someone else?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the men came to Jesus, they said,
“John the Baptist sent us to ask, ‘Are You the One who was to
come, or should we look for someone else?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that very hour Jesus healed many people
of their diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits, and He gave sight
to many who were blind. So He replied, <font color="#a80000">“Go
back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind
receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,
the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed is the one who does not fall away on account of Me.”</font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After John’s messengers had left, Jesus
began to speak to the crowds about John: <font color="#a80000">“What
did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the
wind? Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine
clothes? Look, those who wear elegant clothing and live in luxury are
found in palaces.</font> </font>

out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This
is the one about whom it is written: </font></font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">All the people who heard this, even the
tax collectors, acknowledged God’s justice. For they had received
the baptism of John. But the Pharisees and experts in the law
rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been
baptized by John. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to
eat with him, and He entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined at
the table. When a sinful woman from that town learned that Jesus was
dining there, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume. As she stood
behind Him at His feet weeping, she began to wet His feet with her
tears and wipe them with her hair. Then she kissed His feet and
anointed them with the perfume. </font>
