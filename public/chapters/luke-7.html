<span class="reftext">2</span>There a highly valued servant of a centurion was sick and about to die.
<span class="reftext">3</span>When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to ask <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> to come and heal his servant.
<span class="reftext">4</span>They came to Jesus and pleaded with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> earnestly, “This man is worthy to have <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> grant this,
<span class="reftext">5</span>for he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So Jesus went with them. But when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends with the message: “Lord, do not trouble <span class='cap'>Yourself</span><span class='nocap'>yourself</span><span class='bsb'>Yourself</span>, for I am not worthy to have <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> come under my roof.
<span class="reftext">7</span>That is why I did not consider myself worthy to come to <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
<span class="reftext">8</span>For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes; and another to come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>When Jesus heard this, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> <span class='spell ca'>marvelled</span><span class='spell gb'>marvelled</span><span class='spell us'>marveled</span> at the centurion.

<span class="reftext">10</span>And when the messengers returned to the house, they found the servant in good health.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Raises a Widow’s Son</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain. His disciples went with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, accompanied by a large crowd.
<span class="reftext">12</span>As <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> approached the town gate, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> saw a dead man being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>When the Lord saw her, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had compassion on her and said, <span>“Do not weep.”</span>
<span class="reftext">14</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> went up and touched the coffin,<span class="fn">a</span>  and those carrying it stood still. <span>“Young man,”</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said, <span>“I tell you, get up!”</span>
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the dead man sat up and began to speak! Then Jesus gave him back to his mother.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>A sense of awe swept over all of them, and they glorified God. “A great prophet has appeared among us!” they said. “God has visited <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> people!”
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding region.
</p><p class="hdg">John’s Inquiry<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 11:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then John’s disciples informed him about all these things.
<span class="reftext">19</span>So John called two of his disciples and sent them to ask the Lord, “Are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> who was to come, or should we look for someone else?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the <span class='cap'>Baptist</span><span class='nocap'>baptist</span><span class='bsb'>Baptist</span> sent us to ask, ‘Are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> who was to come, or should we look for someone else?’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>At that very hour Jesus healed many people of their diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> gave sight to many who were blind.
<span class="reftext">22</span>So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> replied, <span>“Go back and report to John what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers<span class="fn">b</span>  are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.

<span class="reftext">25</span>Otherwise, what did <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who wear elegant clothing and live in luxury are found in palaces.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">26</span>What then did <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and more than a prophet.
<span class="reftext">27</span>This is the one about whom it is written: </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘Behold, I will send <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> messenger ahead of <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>, </p><p class="indentred"> who will prepare <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> way before <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>.’<span class="fn">d</span>

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>All the people who heard this, even the tax collectors, acknowledged God’s justice. For they had received the baptism of John.
<span class="reftext">30</span>But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>“To what, then, can I compare the men of this generation? What are they like?

<span class="reftext">37</span>When a sinful woman from that town learned that Jesus was dining there, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume.
<span class="reftext">38</span>As she stood behind <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> feet weeping, she began to wet <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> feet with her tears and wipe them with her hair.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> would know who this is and what kind of woman is touching <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>—for she is a sinner!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>But Jesus answered him, <span>“Simon, I have something to tell you.”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“Tell me, <span class='cap'>Teacher</span><span class='nocap'>teacher</span><span class='bsb'>Teacher</span>,” he said.

<span class="reftext">42</span>When they were unable to repay him, he forgave both of them. Which one, then, will love him more?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>“I suppose the one who was forgiven more,” Simon replied. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“You have judged correctly,”</span> Jesus said.

<span class="reftext">45</span>You did not greet <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> with a kiss, but she has not stopped kissing <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> feet since I arrived.
