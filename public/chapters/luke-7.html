<font >When Jesus had concluded His discourse in
the hearing of the people, He went to Capernaum. There a highly
valued servant of a centurion was sick and about to die. When the
centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to ask Him to
come and heal his servant. They came to Jesus and pleaded with Him
earnestly, “This man is worthy to have You grant this, for he loves
our nation and has built our synagogue.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jesus went with them. But when He was
not far from the house, the centurion sent friends with the message:
“Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy to have You
come under my roof. That is why I did not consider myself worthy to
come to You. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell
one to go, and he goes; and another to come, and he comes. I tell my
servant to do something, and he does it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus heard this, He marveled at the
centurion. Turning to the crowd following Him, He said, <font color="#a80000">“I
tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.”</font>
And when the messengers returned to the house, they found the servant
in good health. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town
called Nain. His disciples went with Him, accompanied by a large
crowd. As He approached the town gate, He saw a dead man being
carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a
large crowd from the town was with her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Lord saw her, He had compassion
on her and said, <font color="#a80000">“Do not weep.”</font> Then
He went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still.
<font color="#a80000">“Young man,”</font> He said, <font color="#a80000">“I
tell you, get up!”</font> And the dead man sat up and began to
speak! Then Jesus gave him back to his mother. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A sense of awe swept over all of them, and
they glorified God. “A great prophet has appeared among us!” they
said. “God has visited His people!” And the news about Jesus
spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding region. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then John’s disciples informed him about
all these things. So John called two of his disciples and sent them
to ask the Lord, “Are You the One who was to come, or should we
look for someone else?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the men came to Jesus, they said,
“John the Baptist sent us to ask, ‘Are You the One who was to
come, or should we look for someone else?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that very hour Jesus healed many people
of their diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits, and He gave sight
to many who were blind. So He replied, <font color="#a80000">“Go
back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind
receive sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,
the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.
Blessed is the one who does not fall away on account of Me.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After John’s messengers had left, Jesus
began to speak to the crowds about John: <font color="#a80000">“What
did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the
wind? Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine
clothes? Look, those who wear elegant clothing and live in luxury are
found in palaces.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >What then did you go
out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This
is the one about whom it is written: </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Behold, I will
send My messenger ahead of You, </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >who will prepare
Your way before You.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >I tell you, among
those born of women there is no one greater than John, yet even the
least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All the people who heard this, even the
tax collectors, acknowledged God’s justice. For they had received
the baptism of John. But the Pharisees and experts in the law
rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been
baptized by John. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >To what, then,
can I compare the men of this generation? What are they like? They
are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one
another: </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >We played the
flute for you, </font></font>

dance; </font></font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >For John the Baptist
came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a
demon!’ The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look
at this glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and
sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by all her children.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to
eat with him, and He entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined at
the table. When a sinful woman from that town learned that Jesus was
dining there, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume. As she stood
behind Him at His feet weeping, she began to wet His feet with her
tears and wipe them with her hair. Then she kissed His feet and
anointed them with the perfume. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus
saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, He would
know who this is and what kind of woman is touching Him—for she is
a sinner!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus answered him, <font color="#a80000">“Simon,
I have something to tell you.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Tell me, Teacher,” he said. </font>

<font color="#a80000">“<font >Two men were
debtors to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii,
and the other fifty. When they were unable to repay him, he forgave
both of them. Which one, then, will love him more?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I suppose the one who was forgiven
more,” Simon replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >You have judged
correctly,”</font> Jesus said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And turning toward the woman, He said to
Simon, <font color="#a80000">“Do you see this woman? When I entered
your house, you did not give Me water for My feet, but she wet My
feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not greet
Me with a kiss, but she has not stopped kissing My feet since I
arrived. You did not anoint My head with oil, but she has anointed My
feet with perfume. Therefore I tell you, because her many sins have
been forgiven, she has loved much. But he who has been forgiven
little loves little.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to her, <font color="#a80000">“Your
sins are forgiven.”</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But those at the table began to say to
themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jesus told the woman, <font color="#a80000">“Your
faith has saved you; go in peace.”</font> </font>
