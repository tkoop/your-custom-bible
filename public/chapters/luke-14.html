<font >One Sabbath, Jesus went to eat in the home
of a leading Pharisee, and those in attendance were watching Him
closely. Right there before Him was a man with dropsy. So Jesus asked
the experts in the law and the Pharisees, <font color="#a80000">“Is
it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But they remained silent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Jesus took hold of the man, healed
him, and sent him on his way. And He asked them, <font color="#a80000">“Which
of you whose son or ox falls into a pit on the Sabbath day will not
immediately pull him out?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And they were unable to answer these
questions. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Jesus noticed how the guests chose
the places of honor, He told them a parable: <font color="#a80000">“When
you are invited to a wedding banquet, do not sit in the place of
honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited.
Then the host who invited both of you will come and tell you, ‘Give
this man your seat.’ And in humiliation, you will have to take the
last place.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But when you are
invited, go and sit in the last place, so that your host will come
and tell you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will
be honored in front of everyone at the table with you. For everyone
who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself
will be exalted.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to the man who had invited
Him, <font color="#a80000">“When you host a dinner or a banquet, do
not invite your friends or brothers or relatives or rich neighbors.
Otherwise, they may invite you in return, and you will be repaid. But
when you host a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and
the blind, and you will be blessed. Since they cannot repay you, you
will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When one of those reclining with Him heard
this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is everyone who will eat at the
feast in the kingdom of God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“A
certain man prepared a great banquet and invited many guests. When it
was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who had
been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But one after
another they all began to make excuses. The first one said, ‘I have
bought a field, and I need to go see it. Please excuse me.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Another said, ‘I
have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out. Please
excuse me.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Still another said,
‘I have married a wife, so I cannot come.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The servant returned
and reported all this to his master. Then the owner of the house
became angry and said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the
streets and alleys of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled,
the blind, and the lame.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Sir,’ the
servant replied, ‘what you ordered has been done, and there is
still room.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >So the master told
his servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges and compel them to
come in, so that my house will be full. For I tell you, not one of
those men who were invited will taste my banquet.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”

<font >Large crowds were now traveling with
Jesus, and He turned and said to them, <font color="#a80000">“If
anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother and wife
and children and brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life—he
cannot be My disciple. And whoever does not carry his cross and
follow Me cannot be My disciple.</font> </font>

wishing to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost

started to build.’ </font></font>
