<font ><b>David and Bathsheba</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the spring, at the time when kings
march out to war, David sent out Joab and his servants with the whole
army of Israel. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah, but
David remained in Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One evening David got up from his bed and
strolled around on the roof of the palace. And from the roof he saw a
woman bathing—a very beautiful woman. So David sent and inquired
about the woman, and he was told, “This is Bathsheba, the daughter
of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David sent messengers to get her, and
when she came to him, he slept with her. (Now she had just purified
herself from her uncleanness.) Then she returned home. And the woman
conceived and sent word to David, saying, “I am pregnant.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, David sent orders to Joab: “Send
me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent him to David. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Uriah came to him, David asked how
Joab and the troops were doing with the war. Then he said to Uriah,
“Go down to your house and wash your feet.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from
the king followed him. But Uriah slept at the door of the palace with
all his master’s servants; he did not go down to his house. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David was told, “Uriah did not go
home.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Haven’t you just arrived from a
journey?” David asked Uriah. “Why didn’t you go home?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Uriah answered, “The ark and Israel and
Judah are dwelling in tents, and my master Joab and his soldiers are
camped in the open field. How can I go to my house to eat and drink
and sleep with my wife? As surely as you live, and as your soul
lives, I will not do such a thing!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Stay here one more day,” David said
to Uriah, “and tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah stayed in
Jerusalem that day and the next. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David invited Uriah to eat and drink
with him, and he got Uriah drunk. And in the evening Uriah went out
to lie down on his cot with his master’s servants, but he did not
go home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next morning David wrote a letter to
Joab and sent it with Uriah. In the letter he wrote: “Put Uriah at
the front of the fiercest battle; then withdraw from him, so that he
may be struck down and killed.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So as Joab besieged the city, he assigned
Uriah to a place where he saw the strongest enemy soldiers. And when
the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of David’s
servants fell, and Uriah the Hittite also died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Joab sent to David a full account of the
battle and instructed the messenger, “When you have finished giving
the king all the details of the battle, if the king’s anger flares,
he may ask you, ‘Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Did
you not realize they would shoot from atop the wall? Who was the one
to strike Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth? Was it not a woman who
dropped an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in
Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If so, then you are to say, ‘Your
servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the messenger set out and reported to
David all that Joab had sent him to say. The messenger said to David,
“The men overpowered us and came out against us in the field, but
we drove them back to the entrance of the gate. Then the archers shot
at your servants from the wall, and some of the king’s servants
were killed. And your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead as well.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David told the messenger, “Say this
to Joab: ‘Do not let this matter upset you, for the sword devours
one as well as another. Strengthen your attack against the city and
demolish it.’ Encourage him with these words.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Uriah’s wife heard that her husband
was dead, she mourned for him. And when the time of mourning was
over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and
bore him a son. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the thing that David had done was evil
in the sight of the LORD. </font>
