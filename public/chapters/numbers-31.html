<font ><b>Vengeance on Midian</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “Take
vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will
be gathered to your people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Moses told the people, “Arm some of
your men for war, that they may go against the Midianites and execute
the LORD’s vengeance on them. Send into battle a thousand men from
each tribe of Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So a thousand men were recruited from each
tribe of Israel—twelve thousand armed for war. And Moses sent the
thousand from each tribe into battle, along with Phinehas son of
Eleazar the priest, who took with him the vessels of the sanctuary
and the trumpets for signaling. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then they waged war against Midian, as the
LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed every male. Among the slain
were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba—the five kings of Midian. They
also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The Israelites captured the Midianite
women and their children, and they plundered all their herds, flocks,
and goods. Then they burned all the cities where the Midianites had
lived, as well as all their encampments, and carried away all the
plunder and spoils, both people and animals. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >They brought the captives, spoils, and
plunder to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of
Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from
Jericho. And Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the
congregation went to meet them outside the camp. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But Moses was angry with the officers of
the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who
were returning from the battle. “Have you spared all the women?”
he asked them. “Look, these women caused the sons of Israel,
through the counsel of Balaam, to turn unfaithfully against the LORD
at Peor, so that the plague struck the congregation of the LORD. So
now, kill all the boys, as well as every woman who has had relations
with a man, but spare for yourselves every girl who has never had
relations with a man. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >All of you who have killed a person or
touched the dead are to remain outside the camp for seven days. On
the third day and the seventh day you are to purify both yourselves
and your captives. And purify every garment and leather good,
everything made of goat’s hair, and every article of wood.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Eleazar the priest said to the
soldiers who had gone into battle, “This is the statute of the law
which the LORD has commanded Moses: Only the gold, silver, bronze,
iron, tin, and lead— everything that can withstand the fire—must
be put through the fire, and it will be clean. But it must still be
purified with the water of purification. And everything that cannot
withstand the fire must pass through the water. On the seventh day
you are to wash your clothes, and you will be clean. After that you
may enter the camp.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The LORD said to Moses, “You and Eleazar
the priest and the family heads of the congregation are to take a
count of what was captured, both of man and beast. Then divide the
captives between the troops who went out to battle and the rest of
the congregation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Set aside a tribute for the LORD from what
belongs to the soldiers who went into battle: one out of every five
hundred, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, or sheep. Take it from
their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the
LORD. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<font >Then the officers who were over the units

bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces—to make atonement for

plunder for himself. And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the
gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and brought it
into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the
LORD. </font>
