<font ><b>A Wife for Isaac</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >By now Abraham was old and well along in
years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way. So Abraham
instructed the chief servant of his household, who managed all he
owned, “Place your hand under my thigh, and I will have you swear
by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will
not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among
whom I am dwelling, but will go to my country and my kindred to take
a wife for my son Isaac.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The servant asked him, “What if the
woman is unwilling to follow me to this land? Shall I then take your
son back to the land from which you came?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Abraham replied, “Make sure that you do
not take my son back there. The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought
me from my father’s house and my native land, who spoke to me and
promised me on oath, saying, ‘To your offspring I will give this
land’—He will send His angel before you so that you can take a
wife for my son from there. And if the woman is unwilling to follow
you, then you are released from this oath of mine. Only do not take
my son back there.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the servant placed his hand under the
thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this
matter. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the servant took ten of his master’s
camels and departed with all manner of good things from his master in
hand. And he set out for Nahor’s hometown in Aram-naharaim. As
evening approached, he made the camels kneel down near the well
outside the town at the time when the women went out to draw water. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >O LORD, God of my master Abraham,” he
prayed, “please grant me success today, and show kindness to my
master Abraham. Here I am, standing beside the spring, and the
daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. Now may it
happen that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar that
I may drink,’ and who responds, ‘Drink, and I will water your
camels as well’—let her be the one You have appointed for Your
servant Isaac. By this I will know that You have shown kindness to my
master.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Before the servant had finished praying,
Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter
of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor. Now
the girl was very beautiful, a virgin who had not had relations with
any man. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up
again. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the servant ran to meet her and said,
“Please let me have a little water from your jar.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Drink, my lord,” she replied, and she
quickly lowered her jar to her hands and gave him a drink. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After she had given him a drink, she said,
“I will also draw water for your camels, until they have had enough
to drink.” And she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran
back to the well to draw water, until she had drawn water for all his
camels. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, the man watched her silently to
see whether or not the LORD had made his journey a success. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And after the camels had finished
drinking, he took out a gold ring weighing a beka, and two gold
bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels. “Whose daughter are
you?” he asked. “Please tell me, is there room in your father’s
house for us to spend the night?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >She replied, “I am the daughter of
Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor.” Then she added, “We
have plenty of straw and feed, as well as a place for you to spend
the night.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the man bowed down and worshiped the
LORD, saying, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham,
who has not withheld His kindness and faithfulness from my master. As
for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my
master’s relatives.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The girl ran and told her mother’s
household about these things. Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban,
and he rushed out to the man at the spring. As soon as he saw the
ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and heard Rebekah’s
words, “The man said this to me,” he went and found the man
standing by the camels near the spring. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Come, you who are blessed by the LORD,”
said Laban. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the
house and a place for the camels.” So the man came to the house,
and the camels were unloaded. Straw and feed were brought to the
camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of his companions. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a meal was set before the man, but he
said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I came to say.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Laban said, “Please speak.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I am Abraham’s servant,” he
replied. “The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become
rich. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants
and maidservants, camels and donkeys. My master’s wife Sarah has
borne him a son in her old age, and my master has given him
everything he owns. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >My master made me swear an oath and said,
‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the
Canaanites in whose land I dwell, but you shall go to my father’s
house and to my kindred to take a wife for my son.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I asked my master, ‘What if the
woman will not come back with me?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And he told me, ‘The LORD, before whom I
have walked, will send His angel with you and make your journey a
success, so that you may take a wife for my son from my kindred and
from my father’s house. And when you go to my kindred, if they
refuse to give her to you, then you will be released from my oath.’
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So when I came to the spring today, I
prayed: O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if only You would make my
journey a success! Here I am, standing beside this spring. Now if a
maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, ‘Please let me
drink a little water from your jar,’ and she replies, ‘Drink, and
I will draw water for your camels as well,’ may she be the woman
the LORD has appointed for my master’s son. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And before I had finished praying in my
heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her jar on her shoulder, and
she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please
give me a drink.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >She quickly lowered her jar from her
shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well.’
So I drank, and she also watered the camels. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are
you?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >She replied, ‘The daughter of Bethuel
son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her
nose and the bracelets on her wrists. Then I bowed down and worshiped
the LORD; and I blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who
led me on the right road to take the granddaughter of my master’s
brother for his son. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if you will show kindness and
faithfulness to my master, tell me; but if not, let me know, so that
I may go elsewhere.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is
from the LORD; we have no choice in the matter. Rebekah is here
before you. Take her and go, and let her become the wife of your
master’s son, just as the LORD has decreed.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Abraham’s servant heard their
words, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD. Then he brought
out jewels of silver and gold, and articles of clothing, and he gave
them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brother and her
mother. Then he and the men with him ate and drank and spent the
night there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they got up the next morning, he
said, “Send me on my way to my master.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But her brother and mother said, “Let
the girl remain with us ten days or so. After that, she may go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But he replied, “Do not delay me, since
the LORD has made my journey a success. Send me on my way so that I
may go to my master.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they said, “We will call the girl and
ask her opinion.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They called Rebekah and asked her, “Will
you go with this man?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I will go,” she replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they sent their sister Rebekah on her
way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men. And
they blessed Rebekah and said to her, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Our sister, may you become the mother </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >of thousands upon thousands. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >May your offspring possess </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >the gates of their enemies.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Rebekah and her servant girls got
ready, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took
Rebekah and left. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Isaac had just returned from
Beer-lahai-roi, for he was living in the Negev. Early in the evening,
Isaac went out to the field to meditate, and looking up, he saw the
camels approaching. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac,
she got down from her camel and asked the servant, “Who is that man
in the field coming to meet us?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >It is my master,” the servant
answered. So she took her veil and covered herself. Then the servant
told Isaac all that he had done. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Isaac brought her into the tent of his
mother Sarah and took Rebekah as his wife. And Isaac loved her and
was comforted after his mother’s death. </font>
