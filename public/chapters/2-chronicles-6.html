<font ><b>Solomon’s Prayer of Dedication</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Solomon declared: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >The LORD has said that He would dwell </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >in the thick cloud; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and I have built You an exalted house, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >a place for You to dwell forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And as the whole assembly of Israel stood
there, the king turned around and blessed them all and said: </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,
who has fulfilled with His own hand what He spoke with His mouth to
my father David, saying, ‘Since the day I brought My people out of
the land of Egypt, I have not chosen a city from any tribe of Israel
in which to build a house so that My Name would be there, nor have I
chosen anyone to be ruler over My people Israel. But now I have
chosen Jerusalem for My Name to be there, and I have chosen David to
be over My people Israel.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now it was in the heart of my father David
to build a house for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel. But the
LORD said to my father David, ‘Since it was in your heart to build
a house for My Name, you have done well to have this in your heart.
Nevertheless, you are not the one to build it; but your son, your own
offspring, will build the house for My Name.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the LORD has fulfilled the word that
He spoke. I have succeeded my father David, and I sit on the throne
of Israel, as the LORD promised. I have built the house for the Name
of the LORD, the God of Israel. And there I have provided a place for
the ark, which contains the covenant of the LORD that He made with
the children of Israel.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Solomon stood before the altar of the
LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his
hands. Now Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five
cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had placed it in the middle
of the courtyard. He stood on it, knelt down before the whole
assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven, and said: </font>

“<font >O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God
like You in heaven or on earth, keeping Your covenant of loving
devotion with Your servants who walk before You with all their
hearts. You have kept Your promise to Your servant, my father David.
What You spoke with Your mouth You have fulfilled with Your hand this
day. </font>

<font >Therefore now, O LORD, God of Israel, keep
for Your servant, my father David, what You promised when You said:
‘You will never fail to have a man to sit before Me on the throne
of Israel, if only your descendants guard their way to walk in My law
as you have walked before Me.’ And now, O LORD, God of Israel,
please confirm what You promised to Your servant David. </font>

the earth? Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain You, much

rewarding him according to his righteousness. </font>

temple— be heard by You from heaven, Your dwelling place. And may
You forgive and repay each man according to all his ways, since You
know his heart—for You alone know the hearts of men— so that they
may fear You and walk in Your ways all the days they live in the land

to You. Then all the peoples of the earth will know Your name and
fear You, as do Your people Israel, and they will know that this
house I have built is called by Your Name. </font>

captors, saying, ‘We have sinned and done wrong; we have acted
wickedly,’ and when they return to You with all their heart and
