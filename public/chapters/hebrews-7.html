<font ><b>Melchizedek and Abraham</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This Melchizedek was king of Salem and
priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the slaughter
of the kings and blessed him, and Abraham apportioned to him a tenth
of everything. First, his name means “king of righteousness.”
Then also, “king of Salem” means “king of peace.” Without
father or mother or genealogy, without beginning of days or end of
life, like the Son of God, he remains a priest for all time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Consider how great Melchizedek was: Even
the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder. Now the law
commands the sons of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from
the people—that is, from their brothers—though they too are
descended from Abraham. But Melchizedek, who did not trace his
descent from Levi, collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who
had the promises. And indisputably, the lesser is blessed by the
greater. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the case of the Levites, mortal men
collect the tenth; but in the case of Melchizedek, it is affirmed
that he lives on. And so to speak, Levi, who collects the tenth, paid
the tenth through Abraham. For when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was
still in the loin of his ancestor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if perfection could have been attained
through the Levitical priesthood (for on this basis the people
received the law), why was there still need for another priest to
appear—one in the order of Melchizedek and not in the order of
Aaron? For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed as
well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He of whom these things are said belonged
to a different tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.
For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, a tribe as to
which Moses said nothing about priests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And this point is even more clear if
another priest like Melchizedek appears, one who has become a priest
not by a law of succession, but by the power of an indestructible
life. For it is testified: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >You are a priest forever </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >in the order of Melchizedek.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the former commandment is set aside
because it was weak and useless (for the law made nothing perfect),
and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And none of this happened without an oath.
For others became priests without an oath, but Jesus became a priest
with an oath by the One who said to Him: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >The Lord has sworn and will not change
His mind: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >You are a priest forever.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Because of this oath, Jesus has become the
guarantee of a better covenant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now there have been many other priests,
since death prevented them from continuing in office. But because
Jesus lives forever, He has a permanent priesthood. Therefore He is
able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him, since
He always lives to intercede for them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Such a high priest truly befits us—One
who is holy, innocent, undefiled, set apart from sinners, and exalted
above the heavens. Unlike the other high priests, He does not need to
offer daily sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins
of the people; He sacrificed for sin once for all when He offered up
Himself. For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but
the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been
made perfect forever. </font>
