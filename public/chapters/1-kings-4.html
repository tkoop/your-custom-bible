<font >The people of Judah and Israel were as
numerous as the sand on the seashore, and they were eating and
drinking and rejoicing. And Solomon reigned over all the kingdoms
from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, as far as the
border of Egypt. These kingdoms offered tribute and served Solomon
all the days of his life. </font>

<font >Solomon’s provisions for a single day
were thirty cors of fine flour, sixty cors of meal, ten fat oxen,
twenty range oxen, and a hundred sheep, as well as deer, gazelles,
roebucks, and fattened poultry. For Solomon had dominion over
everything west of the Euphrates —over all the kingdoms from
Tiphsah to Gaza—and he had peace on all sides. Throughout the days
of Solomon, Judah and Israel dwelt securely from Dan to Beersheba,
each man under his own vine and his own fig tree. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his chariot
horses and 12,000 horses. Each month the governors in turn provided
food for King Solomon and all who came to his table. They saw to it
that nothing was lacking. Each one also brought to the required place
their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and other
horses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And God gave Solomon wisdom, exceedingly
deep insight, and understanding beyond measure, like the sand on the
seashore. Solomon’s wisdom was greater than that of all the men of
the East, greater than all the wisdom of Egypt. He was wiser than all
men—wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and wiser than Heman, Calcol,
and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread throughout the
surrounding nations. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Solomon composed three thousand proverbs,
and his songs numbered a thousand and five. He spoke of trees, from
the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing in the wall, and he taught
about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So men of all nations came to listen to
Solomon’s wisdom, sent by all the kings of the earth, who had heard
of his wisdom. </font>
