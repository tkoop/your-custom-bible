</p><p class="hdg">Solomon’s Twelve Officers</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Solomon had twelve governors over all Israel to provide food for the king and his household. Each one would arrange provisions for one month of the year,
<span class="reftext">8</span>and these were their names: </p><p class="list1stline"> Ben-hur in the hill country of Ephraim;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Ben-deker in Makaz, in Shaalbim, in Beth-shemesh, and in Elon-beth-hanan;

</p><p class="hdg">Solomon’s Prosperity</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore, and they were eating and drinking and rejoicing.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Solomon reigned over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates<span class="fn">e</span>  to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These kingdoms offered tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Solomon’s provisions for a single day were thirty cors of fine flour,<span class="fn">f</span>  sixty cors of meal,<span class="fn">g</span> 
<span class="reftext">23</span>ten fat oxen, twenty range oxen, and a hundred sheep, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened poultry.
<span class="reftext">24</span>For Solomon had dominion over everything west of the Euphrates<span class="fn">h</span> —over all the kingdoms from Tiphsah to Gaza—and he had peace on all sides.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Throughout the days of Solomon, Judah and Israel dwelt securely from Dan to Beersheba, each man under his own vine and his own fig tree.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Solomon had 4,000<span class="fn">i</span>  stalls for his chariot horses and 12,000 horses.<span class="fn">j</span> 
<span class="reftext">27</span>Each month the governors in turn provided food for King Solomon and all who came to his table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Each one also brought to the required place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and other horses.
</p><p class="hdg">Solomon’s Wisdom</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>And God gave Solomon wisdom, exceedingly deep insight, and understanding beyond measure, like the sand on the seashore.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Solomon’s wisdom was greater than that of all the men of the East, greater than all the wisdom of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">31</span>He was wiser than all men—wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and wiser than Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread throughout the surrounding nations.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Solomon composed three thousand proverbs, and his songs numbered a thousand and five.
<span class="reftext">33</span>He spoke of trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing in the wall, and he taught about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>So men of all nations came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, sent by all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Shisha</i> is also called <i class="calibre6">Seraiah</i>, <i class="calibre6">Sheva</i>, and <i class="calibre6">Shavsha</i>; see 2 Samuel 8:17, 2 Samuel 20:25, and 1 Chronicles 18:16.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Adoniram</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Adoram</i> and <i class="calibre6">Hadoram</i>; see 2 Samuel 20:24 and 2 Chronicles 10:18.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in all the heights of Dor</i>; <i class="calibre6">Naphath-dor</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Naphoth-dor</i>; see Joshua 11:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Some LXX manuscripts; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">And he was the one governor in the land.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the River</i>; also in verse 24<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">30 cors</i> is approximately 187 bushels or 6,600 liters (probably about 5.5 tons or 5 metric tons of flour).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">60 cors</i> is approximately 375 bushels or 13,200 liters (probably about 11 tons or 10 metric tons of meal).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">beyond the River</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Some LXX manuscripts (see also 2 Chronicles 9:25); Hebrew <i class="calibre6">40,000</i> <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Or <i class="calibre6">horsemen</i> or <i class="calibre6">charioteers</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
