<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Mighty Men Join David at Ziklag</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now these were the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was still banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (they were among the mighty men who helped him in battle;
<span class="reftext">2</span>they were archers using both the right and left hands to sling stones and shoot arrows; and they were Saul’s kinsmen from Benjamin):
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>Ahiezer their chief and Joash, who were the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; </p><p class="list1stline"> Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; </p><p class="list1stline"> Beracah; </p><p class="list1stline"> Jehu the Anathothite;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the <span class='cap'>Thirty</span><span class='nocap'>thirty</span><span class='bsb'>Thirty</span> and a leader over the <span class='cap'>Thirty</span><span class='nocap'>thirty</span><span class='bsb'>Thirty</span>; </p><p class="list1stline"> Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad the Gederathite;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, who were Korahites;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were mighty men of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span>, trained for battle, experts with the shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions and who were as swift as gazelles on the mountains:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,
<span class="reftext">10</span>Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,
<span class="reftext">11</span>Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,
<span class="reftext">12</span>Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,
<span class="reftext">13</span>Jeremiah the tenth, and Machbanai the eleventh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>These Gadites were army commanders, the least of whom was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>These are the ones who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight all those in the valleys, both to the east and to the west.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And David went out to meet them, saying, “If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have come to me in peace to help me, my heart will be united with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>; but if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free of violence, may the God of our fathers see it and judge you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> came upon Amasai, the chief of the <span class='cap'>Thirty</span><span class='nocap'>thirty</span><span class='bsb'>Thirty</span>, and he said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“We are yours, O David! </p><p class="indent"> We are with you, O son of Jesse! </p><p class="indent1"> Peace, peace to you, </p><p class="indent"> and peace to your helpers, </p><p class="indent"> for your God helps you.” </p><p class="reg1"> So David received them and made them leaders of his troops.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Some from Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (They did not help the Philistines because the Philistine rulers consulted and sent David away, saying, “It will cost us our heads if he defects to his master Saul.”)
<span class="reftext">20</span>When David went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh defected to him: </p><p class="list1stline"> Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>They helped David against the raiders, for they were all mighty men of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span> and commanders in the army.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>For at that time men came to David day after day to help him, until he had a great army, like the army of God.
</p><p class="hdg">David’s Army Grows at Hebron</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Now these are the numbers of men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him, in accordance with the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>:
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>From Judah: 6,800 armed troops bearing shields and spears.

</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>From Levi: 4,600,
<span class="reftext">27</span>including Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron, with 3,700 men,
<span class="reftext">28</span>and Zadok, a mighty young man of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span>, with 22 commanders from his own family.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">29</span>From Benjamin, the kinsmen of Saul: 3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to the house of Saul up to that time.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">30</span>From Ephraim: 20,800 mighty men of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span>, famous among their own clans.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">31</span>From the half-tribe of Manasseh:<span class="fn">a</span>  18,000 designated by name to come and make David king.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">32</span>From Issachar, men who understood the times and knew what Israel should do: 200 chiefs with all their kinsmen at their command.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">33</span>From Zebulun: 50,000 fit for service, trained for battle with all kinds of weapons of war, who with one purpose were devoted to David.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">34</span>From Naphtali: 1,000 commanders, accompanied by 37,000 men with shield and spear.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">35</span>From Dan: 28,600 prepared for battle.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">36</span>From Asher: 40,000 fit for service, prepared for battle.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">37</span>And from east of the Jordan, from Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh there: 120,000 armed with every kind of weapon of war.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>All these men of war, arrayed for battle, came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. And all the rest of the Israelites were of one mind to make David king.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>They spent three days there eating and drinking with David, for their relatives had provided for them.
<span class="reftext">40</span>And their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen—abundant supplies of flour, fig cakes and raisin cakes, wine and oil, oxen and sheep. Indeed, there was joy in Israel.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the half-tribe of Manasseh west of the Jordan<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> LXX; Hebrew does not include <i class="calibre6">to David</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
