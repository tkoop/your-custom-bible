<font >When the day of Pentecost came, they were
all together in one place. Suddenly a sound like a mighty rushing
wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were
sitting. They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated and came
to rest on each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy
Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled
them. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem
God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. And when this sound
rang out, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one
heard them speaking his own language. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Astounded and amazed, they asked, “Are
not all these men who are speaking Galileans? How is it then that
each of us hears them in his own native language? Parthians, Medes,
and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus
and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near
Cyrene; visitors from Rome, both Jews and converts to Judaism;
Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our
own tongues!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Astounded and perplexed, they asked one
another, “What does this mean?” </font>

are drunk on new wine!” </font>

<font >Then Peter stood up with the Eleven,
lifted up his voice, and addressed the crowd: “Men of Judea and all
who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen
carefully to my words. These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It is
only the third hour of the day! No, this is what was spoken by the
prophet Joel: </font>

<font >Men of Israel, listen to this message:
Jesus of Nazareth was a man certified by God to you by miracles,
wonders, and signs, which God did among you through Him, as you
yourselves know. He was delivered up by God’s set plan and
foreknowledge, and you, by the hands of the lawless, put Him to death
by nailing Him to the cross. But God raised Him from the dead,
releasing Him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for
Him to be held in its clutches. </font>

<font >Brothers, I can tell you with confidence
that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is with us
to this day. But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him
on oath that He would place one of his descendants on his throne.
Foreseeing this, David spoke about the resurrection of the Christ,
that He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did His body see decay. God
has raised this Jesus to life, to which we are all witnesses. </font>
