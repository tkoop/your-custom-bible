<font ><b>The Holy Spirit at Pentecost</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the day of Pentecost came, they were
all together in one place. Suddenly a sound like a mighty rushing
wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were
sitting. They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated and came
to rest on each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy
Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem
God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. And when this sound
rang out, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one
heard them speaking his own language. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Astounded and amazed, they asked, “Are
not all these men who are speaking Galileans? How is it then that
each of us hears them in his own native language? Parthians, Medes,
and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus
and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near
Cyrene; visitors from Rome, both Jews and converts to Judaism;
Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our
own tongues!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Astounded and perplexed, they asked one
another, “What does this mean?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But others mocked them and said, “They
are drunk on new wine!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Peter stood up with the Eleven,
lifted up his voice, and addressed the crowd: “Men of Judea and all
who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen
carefully to my words. These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It is
only the third hour of the day! No, this is what was spoken by the
prophet Joel: </font>

<font >Men of Israel, listen to this message:
Jesus of Nazareth was a man certified by God to you by miracles,
wonders, and signs, which God did among you through Him, as you
yourselves know. He was delivered up by God’s set plan and
foreknowledge, and you, by the hands of the lawless, put Him to death
by nailing Him to the cross. But God raised Him from the dead,
releasing Him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for
Him to be held in its clutches. </font>

be shaken. </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

Hades, </font>

<font >Brothers, I can tell you with confidence
that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is with us
to this day. But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him
on oath that He would place one of his descendants on his throne.
Foreseeing this, David spoke about the resurrection of the Christ,
that He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did His body see decay. God
has raised this Jesus to life, to which we are all witnesses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Exalted, then, to the right hand of God,
He has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has
poured out what you now see and hear. For David did not ascend into
heaven, but he himself says: </font>

and Christ!” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the people heard this, they were cut
to the heart and asked Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers,
what shall we do?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized,
every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of
your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. This
promise belongs to you and your children and to all who are far
off—to all whom the Lord our God will call to Himself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >With many other words he testified, and he
urged them, “Be saved from this corrupt generation.” Those who
embraced his message were baptized, and about three thousand were
added to the believers that day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They devoted themselves to the apostles’
teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to
prayer. A sense of awe came over everyone, and the apostles performed
many wonders and signs. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All the believers were together and had
everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods, they
shared with anyone who was in need. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >With one accord they continued to meet
daily in the temple courts and to break bread from house to house,
sharing their meals with gladness and sincerity of heart, praising
God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to
their number daily those who were being saved. </font>
