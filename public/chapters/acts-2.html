<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Holy Spirit at Pentecost<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Genesis 11:1–9; Leviticus 23:15–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When the day of Pentecost<span class="fn">a</span>  came, they were all together in one place.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Suddenly a sound like a mighty rushing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
<span class="reftext">3</span>They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now there were dwelling<span class="fn">b</span>  in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And when this sound rang out, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking his own language.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Astounded and amazed, they asked, “Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?
<span class="reftext">8</span>How is it then that each of us hears them in his own native language?
<span class="reftext">9</span>Parthians, Medes, and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome,
<span class="reftext">11</span>both Jews and converts to Judaism; Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Astounded and perplexed, they asked one another, “What does this mean?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But others mocked them and said, “They are drunk on new wine!”
</p><p class="hdg">Peter Addresses the Crowd<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 16:1–11; Joel 2:28–32)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, lifted up his voice, and addressed the crowd: “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen carefully to my words.
<span class="reftext">15</span>These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It is only the third hour of the day!<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">16</span>No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>‘In the last days, God says, </p><p class="indent"> I will pour out My Spirit on all people. </p><p class="indent1"> Your sons and daughters will prophesy, </p><p class="indent"> your young men will see visions, </p><p class="indent"> your old men will dream dreams.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Even on My menservants and maidservants </p><p class="indent"> I will pour out My Spirit in those days, </p><p class="indent"> and they will prophesy.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>I will show wonders in the heavens above </p><p class="indent"> and signs on the earth below, </p><p class="indent"> blood and fire and billows of smoke.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>The sun will be turned to darkness, </p><p class="indent"> and the moon to blood, </p><p class="indent"> before the coming of the great and glorious Day of the Lord.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord </p><p class="indent"> will be saved.’<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Men of Israel, listen to this message: Jesus of Nazareth was a man certified by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God did among you through Him, as you yourselves know.
<span class="reftext">23</span>He was delivered up by God’s set plan and foreknowledge, and you, by the hands of the lawless, put Him to death by nailing Him to the cross.
<span class="reftext">24</span>But God raised Him from the dead, releasing Him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for Him to be held in its clutches.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>David says about Him: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘I saw<span class="fn">f</span>  the Lord always before me; </p><p class="indent"> because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; </p><p class="indent"> my body also will dwell in hope,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>because You will not abandon my soul to Hades, </p><p class="indent"> nor will You let Your Holy One see decay.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>You have made known to me the paths of life; </p><p class="indent"> You will fill me with joy in Your presence.’<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Brothers, I can tell you with confidence that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
<span class="reftext">30</span>But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that He would place one of his descendants on his throne.<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Foreseeing this, David spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did His body see decay.
<span class="reftext">32</span>God has raised this Jesus to life, to which we are all witnesses.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Exalted, then, to the right hand of God, He has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.
<span class="reftext">34</span>For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘The Lord said to my Lord, </p><p class="indent">“Sit at My right hand
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>until I make Your enemies </p><p class="indent"> a footstool for Your feet.”<span class="thinq"> </span>’<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Therefore let all Israel know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ!”
</p><p class="hdg">Three Thousand Believe</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and asked Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
<span class="reftext">39</span>This promise belongs to you and your children and to all who are far off—to all whom the Lord our God will call to Himself.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>With many other words he testified, and he urged them, “Be saved from this corrupt generation.”
<span class="reftext">41</span>Those who embraced his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to the believers that day.<span class="fn">j</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Fellowship of Believers<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 4:32–37)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
<span class="reftext">43</span>A sense of awe<span class="fn">k</span>  came over everyone, and the apostles performed many wonders and signs.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>All the believers were together and had everything in common.
<span class="reftext">45</span>Selling their possessions and goods, they shared with anyone who was in need.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>With one accord they continued to meet daily in the temple courts<span class="fn">l</span>  and to break bread from house to house, sharing their meals with gladness and sincerity of heart,
<span class="reftext">47</span>praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, Shavuot, the late spring feast of pilgrimage to Jerusalem; it is also known as <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Harvest</i> (see Exodus 23:16) or <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Weeks</i> (see Exodus 34:22).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">staying</i>; similarly in verse 14<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, the Roman Province of Asia, located in what is now western Turkey<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> That is, nine in the morning<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Joel 2:28–32 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">I foresaw</i>; see verse 31.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Psalm 16:8–11 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">on oath that He would place out of the fruit of his loins on his throne</i>; BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">on oath out of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, to raise up Christ to sit on his throne</i>; Psalm 132:11<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Psalm 110:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">41</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">about three thousand souls were added that day</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">43</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Or <i class="calibre6">fear</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">46</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
