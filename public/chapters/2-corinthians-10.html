Corinthians 10</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font ><b>Paul’s Apostolic Authority</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now by the mildness and gentleness of
Christ, I appeal to you—I, Paul, who am humble when face to face
with you, but bold when away. I beg you that when I come I may not
need to be as bold as I expect toward those who presume that we live
according to the flesh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For though we live in the flesh, we do not
wage war according to the flesh. The weapons of our warfare are not
the weapons of the world. Instead, they have divine power to demolish
strongholds. We tear down arguments and every presumption set up
against the knowledge of God; and we take captive every thought to
make it obedient to Christ. And we will be ready to punish every act
of disobedience, as soon as your obedience is complete. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are looking at outward appearances. If
anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind
himself that we belong to Christ just as much as he does. For even if
I boast somewhat excessively about the authority the Lord gave us for
building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I do not want to seem to be trying to
frighten you by my letters. For some say, “His letters are weighty
and forceful, but his physical presence is unimpressive, and his
speaking is of no account.” Such people should consider that what
we are in our letters when absent, we will be in our actions when
present. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We do not dare to classify or compare
ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure
themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they
show their ignorance. We, however, will not boast beyond our limits,
but only within the field of influence that God has assigned to us—a
field that reaches even to you. We are not overstepping our bounds,
as if we had not come to you. Indeed, we were the first to reach you
with the gospel of Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Neither do we boast beyond our limits in
the labors of others. But we hope that as your faith increases, our
area of influence among you will greatly increase as well, so that we
can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. Then we will not be
boasting in the work already done in another man’s territory. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Rather, “Let him who boasts boast in the
Lord.” For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved,
but the one whom the Lord commends. </font>
