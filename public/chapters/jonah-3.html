<font >Then the word of the LORD came to Jonah a

requiring a three-day journey. On the first day of his journey, Jonah
set out into the city and proclaimed, “Forty more days and Nineveh
will be overturned!” </font>

<font >Let no man or beast, herd or flock, taste
anything at all. They must not eat or drink. Furthermore, let both
man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and have everyone call out
earnestly to God. Let each one turn from his evil ways and from the
violence in his hands. Who knows? God may turn and relent; He may
turn from His fierce anger, so that we will not perish.” </font>

turned from their evil ways—He relented from the disaster He had
threatened to bring upon them. </font>
