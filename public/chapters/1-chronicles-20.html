<font ><b>The Capture of Rabbah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the spring, at the time when kings
march out to war, Joab led out the army and ravaged the land of the
Ammonites. He came to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in
Jerusalem. And Joab attacked Rabbah and demolished it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David took the crown from the head of
their king. It was found to weigh a talent of gold and was set with
precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head. And David took
a great amount of plunder from the city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David brought out the people who were
there and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. And he
did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his
troops returned to Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some time later, war broke out with the
Philistines at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed
Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were
subdued. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once again there was a battle with the
Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of
Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s
beam. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And there was still another battle at
Gath, where there was a man of great stature with six fingers on each
hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was
descended from Rapha, and when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of
David’s brother Shimei killed him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So these descendants of Rapha in Gath fell
at the hands of David and his servants. </font>
