He came to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. And Joab attacked Rabbah and demolished it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Then David took the crown from the head of their king.<span class="fn">b</span>  It was found to weigh a talent of gold<span class="fn">c</span>  and was set with precious stones, and it was placed on David’s head. And David took a great amount of plunder from the city.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>David brought out the people who were there and put them to work<span class="fn">d</span>  with saws, iron picks, and axes. And he did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.

At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai,<span class="fn">e</span>  a descendant of the Rephaim,<span class="fn">f</span>  and the Philistines were subdued.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Once again there was a battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother<span class="fn">g</span>  of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>And there was still another battle at Gath, where there was a man of great stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He too was descended from Rapha,
<span class="reftext">7</span>and when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of David’s brother Shimei killed him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So these descendants of Rapha in Gath fell at the hands of David and his servants.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">At the turn of the year</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">from the head of Milcom</i>.
