<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Philistines gathered their forces
for war at Socoh in Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah
in Ephes-dammim. Saul and the men of Israel assembled and camped in
the Valley of Elah, arraying themselves for battle against the
Philistines. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Philistines stood on one hill and the
Israelites stood on another, with the valley between them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a champion named Goliath, who was
from Gath, came out from the Philistine camp. He was six cubits and a
span in height, and he had a bronze helmet on his head. He wore a
bronze coat of mail weighing five thousand shekels, and he had armor
of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his
shoulders. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and its
iron point weighed six hundred shekels. In addition, his shield
bearer went before him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks
of Israel, “Why do you come out and array yourselves for battle? Am
I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose one of
your men and have him come down against me. If he is able to fight me
and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against
him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and labor for us.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Philistine said, “I defy the
ranks of Israel this day! Give me a man to fight!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On hearing the words of the Philistine,
Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and greatly afraid. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now David was the son of a man named
Jesse, an Ephrathite from Bethlehem of Judah who had eight sons in
the days of Saul. And Jesse was old and well along in years. The
three older sons of Jesse had followed Saul into battle: The
firstborn was Eliab, the second was Abinadab, and the third was
Shammah. And David was the youngest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The three oldest had followed Saul, but
David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep in
Bethlehem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For forty days the Philistine came forward
every morning and evening to take his stand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One day Jesse said to his son David, “Take
this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your
brothers and hurry to their camp. Take also these ten portions of
cheese to the commander of their unit. Check on the welfare of your
brothers and bring back an assurance from them. They are with Saul
and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the
Philistines.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David got up early in the morning, left
the flock with a keeper, loaded up, and set out as Jesse had
instructed him. He reached the camp as the army was marching out to
its position and shouting the battle cry. And Israel and the
Philistines arrayed in formation against each other. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David left his supplies in the care
of the quartermaster and ran to the battle line. When he arrived, he
asked his brothers how they were doing. And as he was speaking with
them, suddenly the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath,
came forward from the Philistines and shouted his usual words, which
David also heard. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When all the men of Israel saw Goliath,
they fled from him in great fear. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the men of Israel had been saying, “Do
you see this man who keeps coming out to defy Israel? To the man who
kills him the king will give great riches. And he will give him his
daughter in marriage and exempt his father’s house from taxation in
Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David asked the men who were standing with
him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and
removes this disgrace from Israel? Just who is this uncircumcised
Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The people told him about the offer,
saying, “That is what will be done for the man who kills him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now when David’s oldest brother Eliab
heard him speaking to the men, his anger burned against David. “Why
have you come down here?” he asked. “And with whom did you leave
those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and wickedness
of heart—you have come down to see the battle!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What have I done now?” said David.
“Was it not just a question?” Then he turned from him toward
another and asked about the offer, and those people answered him just
as the first ones had answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now David’s words were overheard and
reported to Saul, who called for him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David said to Saul, “Let no man’s
heart fail on account of this Philistine. Your servant will go and
fight him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Saul replied, “You cannot go out
against this Philistine to fight him. You are just a boy, and he has
been a warrior from his youth.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David replied, “Your servant has been
tending his father’s sheep, and whenever a lion or a bear came and
carried off a lamb from the flock, I went after it, struck it down,
and delivered the lamb from its mouth. If it reared up against me, I
would grab it by its fur, strike it down, and kill it. Your servant
has killed lions and bears; this uncircumcised Philistine will be
like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David added, “The LORD, who delivered me
from the claws of the lion and the bear, will deliver me from the
hand of this Philistine.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Go,” said Saul, “and may the LORD
be with you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Saul clothed David in his own tunic,
put a bronze helmet on his head, and dressed him in armor. David
strapped his sword over the tunic and tried to walk, but he was not
accustomed to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I cannot walk in these,” David said
to Saul. “I am not accustomed to them.” So David took them off.
And David took his staff in his hand, selected five smooth stones
from the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag.
And with his sling in hand, he approached the Philistine. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Philistine came closer and closer
to David, with his shield-bearer before him. When the Philistine
looked and saw David, he despised him because he was just a boy,
ruddy and handsome. “Am I a dog,” he said to David, “that you
come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his
gods. “Come here,” he called to David, “and I will give your
flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But David said to the Philistine, “You
come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against
you in the name of the LORD of Hosts, the God of the armies of
Israel, whom you have defied. This day the LORD will deliver you into
my hand. This day I will strike you down, cut off your head, and give
the carcasses of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the
creatures of the earth. Then the whole world will know that there is
a God in Israel. And all those assembled here will know that it is
not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the
LORD’s, and He will give all of you into our hands.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the Philistine started forward to
attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.
Then David reached into his bag, took out a stone, and slung it,
striking the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his
forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus David prevailed over the Philistine
with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down
the Philistine and killed him. David ran and stood over him. He
grabbed the Philistine’s sword and pulled it from its sheath and
killed him; and he cut off his head with the sword. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Philistines saw that their hero
was dead, they turned and ran. Then the men of Israel and Judah
charged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the
entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. And the bodies of the
Philistines were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Israelites returned from their
pursuit of the Philistines, they plundered their camps. David took
the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put
Goliath’s weapons in his own tent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Saul had watched David going out to
confront the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army,
“Abner, whose son is this young man?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >As surely as you live, O king,” Abner
replied, “I do not know.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Find out whose son this young man is!”
said the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So when David returned from killing the
Philistine, still holding his head in his hand, Abner took him and
brought him before Saul. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Whose son are you, young man?” asked
Saul. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I am the son of your servant Jesse of
Bethlehem,” David replied. </font>
