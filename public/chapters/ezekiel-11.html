<font >Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought
me to the gate of the house of the LORD that faces east. And there at
the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men. Among them I saw
Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, who were leaders
of the people. And the LORD said to me, “Son of man, these are the
men who plot evil and give wicked counsel in this city. They are
saying, ‘Is not the time near to build houses? The city is the
cooking pot, and we are the meat.’ Therefore prophesy against them;
prophesy, O son of man!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me
and told me to declare that this is what the LORD says: “That is
what you are thinking, O house of Israel; and I know the thoughts
that arise in your minds. You have multiplied those you killed in
this city and filled its streets with the dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says:
The slain you have laid within this city are the meat, and the city
is the pot; but I will remove you from it. You fear the sword, so I
will bring the sword against you, declares the Lord GOD. I will bring
you out of the city and deliver you into the hands of foreigners, and
I will execute judgments against you. You will fall by the sword, and
I will judge you even to the borders of Israel. Then you will know
that I am the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The city will not be a pot for you, nor
will you be the meat within it. I will judge you even to the borders
of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD. For you have
neither followed My statutes nor practiced My ordinances, but you
have conformed to the ordinances of the nations around you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of
Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice,
“Oh, Lord GOD, will You bring the remnant of Israel to a complete
end?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, your brothers—your relatives, your fellow
exiles, and the whole house of Israel—are those of whom the people
of Jerusalem have said, ‘They are far away from the LORD; this land
has been given to us as a possession.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore declare that this is what the
Lord GOD says: ‘Although I sent them far away among the nations and
scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have
been a sanctuary for them in the countries to which they have gone.’
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore declare that this is what the
Lord GOD says: ‘I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you
from the countries to which you have been scattered, and I will give
back to you the land of Israel.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they return to it, they will remove
all its detestable things and all its abominations. And I will give
them singleness of heart and put a new spirit within them; I will
remove their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh, so that
they may follow My statutes, keep My ordinances, and practice them.
Then they will be My people, and I will be their God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But as for those whose hearts pursue
detestable things and abominations, I will bring their conduct down
upon their own heads, declares the Lord GOD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside
them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was
above them. And the glory of the LORD rose up from within the city
and stood over the mountain east of the city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the Spirit lifted me up and carried me
back to Chaldea, to the exiles in the vision given by the Spirit of
God. After the vision had gone up from me, I told the exiles
everything the LORD had shown me. </font>
