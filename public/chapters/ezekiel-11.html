<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Evil in High Places</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> that faces east. And there at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men. Among them I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, who were leaders of the people.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who plot evil and give wicked counsel in this city.
<span class="reftext">3</span>They are saying, ‘Is not the time near to build houses? The city is the cooking pot,<span class="fn">a</span>  and we are the meat.’
<span class="reftext">4</span>Therefore prophesy against them; prophesy, O son of man!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> fell upon me and told me to declare that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: “That is what you are thinking, O house of Israel; and I know the thoughts that arise in your minds.
<span class="reftext">6</span>You have multiplied those you killed in this city and filled its streets with the dead.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: The slain you have laid within this city are the meat, and the city is the pot; but I will remove you from it.
<span class="reftext">8</span>You fear the sword, so I will bring the sword against you, declares the Lord GOD.
<span class="reftext">9</span>I will bring you out of the city and deliver you into the hands of foreigners, and I will execute <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span> against you.
<span class="reftext">10</span>You will fall by the sword, and I will judge you even to the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat within it. I will judge you even to the borders of Israel.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then you will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. For you have neither followed <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes nor practiced <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances, but you have conformed to the ordinances of the nations around you.”
</p><p class="hdg">A Promise of Restoration<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jeremiah 32:36–44)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. Then I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, “Oh, Lord GOD, will <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> bring the remnant of Israel to a complete end?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">15</span>“Son of man, your brothers—your relatives, your fellow exiles, and the whole house of Israel—are those of whom the people of Jerusalem have said, ‘They are far away from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>; this land has been given to us as a possession.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Although I sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, yet for a little while I have been a sanctuary for them in the countries to which they have gone.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I will gather you from the peoples and assemble you from the countries to which you have been scattered, and I will give back to you the land of Israel.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>When they return to it, they will remove all its detestable things and all its abominations.
<span class="reftext">19</span>And I will give them singleness of heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh,
<span class="reftext">20</span>so that they may follow <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> statutes, keep <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances, and practice them. Then they will be <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people, and I will be their God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>But as for those whose hearts pursue detestable things and abominations, I will bring their conduct down upon their own heads, declares the Lord GOD.”
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Glory Leaves Jerusalem</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, spread their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.
