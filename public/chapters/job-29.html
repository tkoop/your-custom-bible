</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“How I long for the months gone by, </p><p class="indent"> for the days when God watched over me,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>when His lamp shone above my head, </p><p class="indent"> and by His light I walked through the darkness,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>when I was in my prime,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> when the friendship of God rested on my tent,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>when the Almighty was still with me </p><p class="indent"> and my children were around me,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>when my steps were bathed in cream </p><p class="indent"> and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>When I went out to the city gate </p><p class="indent"> and took my seat in the public square,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>the young men saw me and withdrew, </p><p class="indent"> and the old men rose to their feet.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The princes refrained from speaking </p><p class="indent"> and covered their mouths with their hands.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>The voices of the nobles were hushed, </p><p class="indent"> and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>For those who heard me called me blessed, </p><p class="indent"> and those who saw me commended me,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>because I rescued the poor who cried out </p><p class="indent"> and the fatherless who had no helper.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>The dying man blessed me, </p><p class="indent"> and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; </p><p class="indent"> justice was my robe and my turban.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>I served as eyes to the blind </p><p class="indent"> and as feet to the lame.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>I was a father to the needy, </p><p class="indent"> and I took up the case of the stranger.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>I shattered the fangs of the unjust </p><p class="indent"> and snatched the prey from his teeth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>So I thought: ‘I will die in my nest </p><p class="indent"> and multiply my days as the sand.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>My roots will spread out to the waters, </p><p class="indent"> and the dew will rest nightly on my branches.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>My glory is ever new within me, </p><p class="indent"> and my bow is renewed in my hand.’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>Men listened to me with expectation, </p><p class="indent"> waiting silently for my counsel.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>After my words, they spoke no more; </p><p class="indent"> my speech settled on them like dew.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>They waited for me as for rain </p><p class="indent"> and drank in my words like spring showers.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>If I smiled at them, they did not believe it; </p><p class="indent"> the light of my countenance was precious.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>I chose their course and presided as chief. </p><p class="indent"> So I dwelt as a king among his troops, </p><p class="indent"> as a comforter of the mourners.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">in the time of my harvest</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
