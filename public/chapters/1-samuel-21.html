And when Ahimelech met David, he trembled and asked him, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“The king has given me a mission,” David replied. “He told me no one is to know about the mission or charge. And I have directed my young men to meet me at a certain place.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“There is no common bread on hand,” the priest replied, “but there is some consecrated bread—provided that the young men have kept themselves from women.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>David answered, “Women have indeed been kept from us, as is usual when I set out. And the equipment of the young men is holy, as it is even on common missions, and all the more at this time.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there but the <span class='cap'>Bread</span><span class='nocap'>bread</span> of the <span class='cap'>Presence</span><span class='nocap'>presence</span>, which had been removed from before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and replaced with hot bread on the day it was taken away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. And his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief shepherd for Saul.
</p><p class="hdg">David Flees to Gath<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 34:1–22; Psalm 56:1–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then David asked Ahimelech, “Is there not a spear or sword on hand here? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business was urgent.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span> of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want, you may take it. For there is no other but this one.” </p><p class="reg1"> And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.
<span class="reftext">11</span>But the servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David, the king of the land? Did they not sing about him in their dances, saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Saul has slain his thousands, </p><p class="indent"> and David his tens of thousands’?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Now David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
<span class="reftext">13</span>So he changed his <span class='spell ca'>behaviour</span><span class='spell gb'>behaviour</span><span class='spell us'>behavior</span> before them and feigned madness in their hands; he scratched on the doors of the gate and let his saliva run down his beard.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> can see that the man is insane! Why have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> brought him to me?
<span class="reftext">15</span>Am I in need of madmen, that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have brought this man to rave in my presence? Must this man come into my house?”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
