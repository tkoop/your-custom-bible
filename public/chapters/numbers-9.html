<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Second Passover</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the first month of the second year
after Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, the LORD spoke to
Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai: “The Israelites are to observe
the Passover at its appointed time. You are to observe it at the
appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in
accordance with its statutes and ordinances.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Moses told the Israelites to observe
the Passover, and they did so in the Wilderness of Sinai, at twilight
on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did
everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But there were some men who were unclean
due to a dead body, so they could not observe the Passover on that
day. And they came before Moses and Aaron that same day and said to
Moses, “We are unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be
excluded from presenting the LORD’s offering with the other
Israelites at the appointed time?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Wait here until I find out what the
LORD commands concerning you,” Moses replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell the
Israelites: ‘When any one of you or your descendants is unclean
because of a dead body, or is away on a journey, he may still observe
the Passover to the LORD. Such people are to observe it at twilight
on the fourteenth day of the second month. They are to eat the lamb,
together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; they may not leave
any of it until morning or break any of its bones. They must observe
the Passover according to all its statutes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But if a man who is ceremonially clean and
is not on a journey still fails to observe the Passover, he must be
cut off from his people, because he did not present the LORD’s
offering at its appointed time. That man will bear the consequences
of his sin. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If a foreigner dwelling among you wants to
observe the Passover to the LORD, he is to do so according to the
Passover statute and its ordinances. You are to apply the same
statute to both the foreigner and the native of the land.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the day that the tabernacle, the Tent
of the Testimony, was set up, the cloud covered it and appeared like
fire above the tabernacle from evening until morning. It remained
that way continually; the cloud would cover the tabernacle by day,
and at night it would appear like fire. Whenever the cloud was lifted
from above the Tent, the Israelites would set out, and wherever the
cloud settled, there the Israelites would camp. At the LORD’s
command the Israelites set out, and at the LORD’s command they
camped. As long as the cloud remained over the tabernacle, they
remained encamped. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Even when the cloud lingered over the
tabernacle for many days, the Israelites kept the LORD’s charge and
did not set out. Sometimes the cloud remained over the tabernacle for
only a few days, and they would camp at the LORD’s command and set
out at the LORD’s command. Sometimes the cloud remained only from
evening until morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they would
set out. Whether it was by day or by night, when the cloud was taken
up, they would set out. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Whether the cloud lingered for two days, a
month, or longer, the Israelites camped and did not set out as long
as the cloud remained over the tabernacle; but when it was lifted,
they would set out. They camped at the LORD’s command, and they set
out at the LORD’s command; they carried out the LORD’s charge
according to His command through Moses. </font>
