<font face="Tahoma, serif">One day Jesus was driving out a demon that
was mute. And when the demon was gone, the man who had been mute
spoke. The crowds were amazed, but some of them said, “It is by
Beelzebul, the prince of the demons, that He drives out demons.”
And others tested Him by demanding a sign from heaven. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to
them, <font color="#a80000">“Every kingdom divided against itself
will be laid waste, and a house divided against a house will fall. If
Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? After
all, you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul. And if I drive out
demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then,
they will be your judges. But if I drive out demons by the finger of
God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</font> </font>

spirit comes out of a man, it passes through arid places seeking rest

itself, and they go in and dwell there. And the final plight of that
man is worse than the first.” </font></font>
