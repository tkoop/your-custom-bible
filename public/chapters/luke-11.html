<font >One day in a place where Jesus had just
finished praying, one of His disciples requested, “Lord, teach us
to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“When

<font >Then Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Suppose
one of you goes to his friend at midnight and says, ‘Friend, lend
me three loaves of bread, because a friend of mine has come to me on
a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.’</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">

<font color="#a80000"><font >So I tell you: Ask,
and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the
door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who
seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. </font></font>

you, if his son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? Or if
he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? So if you who are evil

Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!” </font></font>

<font >One day Jesus was driving out a demon that
was mute. And when the demon was gone, the man who had been mute
spoke. The crowds were amazed, but some of them said, “It is by
Beelzebul, the prince of the demons, that He drives out demons.”
And others tested Him by demanding a sign from heaven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to
them, <font color="#a80000">“Every kingdom divided against itself
will be laid waste, and a house divided against a house will fall. If
Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? After
all, you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul. And if I drive out
demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? So then,
they will be your judges. But if I drive out demons by the finger of
God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</font> </font>

spirit comes out of a man, it passes through arid places seeking rest

itself, and they go in and dwell there. And the final plight of that
man is worse than the first.” </font></font>

<font >As the crowds were increasing, Jesus said,
