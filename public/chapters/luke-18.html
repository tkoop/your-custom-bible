<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus told them a parable about their
need to pray at all times and not lose heart: <font color="#a80000">“In
a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected
men. And there was a widow in that town who kept appealing to him,
‘Give me justice against my adversary.’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >For a while he
refused, but later he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God
nor respect men, yet because this widow keeps pestering me, I will
give her justice. Then she will stop wearing me out with her
perpetual requests.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the Lord said, <font color="#a80000">“Listen
to the words of the unjust judge. Will not God bring about justice
for His elect who cry out to Him day and night? Will He continue to
defer their help? I tell you, He will promptly carry out justice on
their behalf. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find
faith on earth?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >To some who trusted in their own
righteousness and viewed others with contempt, He also told this
parable: <font color="#a80000">“Two men went up to the temple to
pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee
stood by himself and prayed, ‘God, I thank You that I am not like
the other men—swindlers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this
tax collector. I fast twice a week and pay tithes of all that I
acquire.’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But the tax
collector stood at a distance, unwilling even to lift up his eyes to
heaven. Instead, he beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on
me, a sinner!’ I tell you, this man, rather than the Pharisee, went
home justified. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but
the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now people were even bringing their babies
to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them. And when the disciples
saw this, they rebuked those who brought them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus called the children to Him and
said, <font color="#a80000">“Let the little children come to Me,
and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as
these. Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of
God like a little child will never enter it.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a certain ruler asked Him, “Good
Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Why do you call
Me good?”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“No one is
good except God alone. You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit
adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness,
honor your father and mother.’”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >All these I have kept from my youth,”
he said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On hearing this, Jesus told him, <font color="#a80000">“You
still lack one thing: Sell everything you own and give to the poor,
and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when the ruler heard this, he became
very sad, because he was extremely wealthy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Seeing the man’s sadness, Jesus said,
<font color="#a80000">“How hard it is for the rich to enter the
kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier for a camel to pass through the
eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Those who heard this asked, “Who then
can be saved?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“What
is impossible with man is possible with God.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Look,” said Peter, “we have left
all we had to follow You.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Truly I tell
you,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“no one who has
left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of
the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times more in this
age—and in the age to come, eternal life.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus took the Twelve aside and said
to them, <font color="#a80000">“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem,
and everything the prophets have written about the Son of Man will be
fulfilled. He will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be
mocked and insulted and spit upon. They will flog Him and kill Him,
and on the third day He will rise again.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the disciples did not understand any
of these things. The meaning was hidden from them, and they did not
comprehend what He was saying. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Jesus drew near to Jericho, a blind man
was sitting beside the road, begging. When he heard the crowd going
by, he asked what was happening. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Jesus of Nazareth is passing by,”
they told him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David,
have mercy on me!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Those who led the way admonished him to be
silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy
on me!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus stopped and directed that the man be
brought to Him. When he had been brought near, Jesus asked him, <font color="#a80000">“What
do you want Me to do for you?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Lord,” he said, “let me see again.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Receive your
sight!”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“Your faith
has healed you.”</font> Immediately he received his sight and
followed Jesus, glorifying God. And all the people who saw this gave
praise to God. </font>
