<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Persistent Widow</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray at all times and not lose heart:
<span><span class="reftext">2</span>“In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected men.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And there was a widow in that town who kept appealing to him, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">4</span>For a while he refused, but later he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect men,
<span class="reftext">5</span>yet because this widow keeps pestering me, I will give her justice. Then she will stop wearing me out with her perpetual requests.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>And the Lord said, <span>“Listen to the words of the unjust judge.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Will not God bring about justice for <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> elect who cry out to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> day and night? Will <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> continue to defer their help?
<span class="reftext">8</span>I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> will promptly carry out justice on their behalf. Nevertheless, when the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of <span class='cap'>Man</span><span class='nocap'>man</span><span class='bsb'>Man</span> comes, will <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> find faith on <span class='nocap'>Earth</span><span class='cap'>Earth</span><span class='bsb'>earth</span>?”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Pharisee and the Tax Collector</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>To some who trusted in their own righteousness and viewed others with contempt, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> also told this parable:
<span><span class="reftext">10</span>“Two men went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
<span class="reftext">11</span>The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed,<span class="fn">a</span>  ‘God, I thank <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> that I am not like the other men—swindlers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.
<span class="reftext">12</span>I fast twice a week and pay tithes of all that I acquire.’</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">13</span>But the tax collector stood at a distance, unwilling even to lift up his eyes to <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>. Instead, he beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner!’
<span class="reftext">14</span>I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, this man, rather than the Pharisee, went home justified. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Blesses the Children<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 19:13–15; Mark 10:13–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now people were even bringing their babies to Jesus for <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> to place <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> hands on them. And when the disciples saw this, they rebuked those who brought them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But Jesus called the children to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> and said, <span>“Let the little children come to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Truly I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Rich Young Ruler<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 19:16–30; Mark 10:17–31)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then a certain ruler asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, “Good <span class='cap'>Teacher</span><span class='nocap'>teacher</span><span class='bsb'>Teacher</span>, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">19</span>“Why do you call <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> good?”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“No one is good except God alone.
<span class="reftext">20</span>You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> your father and mother.’<span class="fn">b</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>“All these I have kept from my youth,” he said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>On hearing this, Jesus told him, <span>“You still lack one thing: Sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>. Then come, follow <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But when the ruler heard this, he became very sad, because he was extremely wealthy.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Seeing the man’s sadness,<span class="fn">c</span>  Jesus said, <span>“How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!
<span class="reftext">25</span>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>But Jesus said, <span>“What is impossible with man is possible with God.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>“Look,” said Peter, “we have left all we had<span class="fn">d</span>  to follow <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">29</span>“Truly I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
<span class="reftext">30</span>will fail to receive many times more in this age—and in the age to come, eternal life.”</span>

<span class="reftext">32</span>He will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.
<span class="reftext">33</span>They will flog <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> and kill <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, and on the third day <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> will rise again.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>But the disciples did not understand any of these things. The meaning was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend what <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was saying.

<span class="reftext">36</span>When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>“Jesus of Nazareth is passing by,” they told him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>So he called out, “Jesus, <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of David, have mercy on me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Those who led the way admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Jesus stopped and directed that the man be brought to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>. When he had been brought near, Jesus asked him,
<span><span class="reftext">41</span>“What do you want <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> to do for you?”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“Lord,” he said, “let me see again.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">42</span>“Receive your sight!”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“Your faith has healed you.”</span>
