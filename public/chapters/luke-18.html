<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus told them a parable about their
need to pray at all times and not lose heart: <font color="#a80000">“In
a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected
men. And there was a widow in that town who kept appealing to him,
‘Give me justice against my adversary.’</font> </font>

refused, but later he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God
nor respect men, yet because this widow keeps pestering me, I will
give her justice. Then she will stop wearing me out with her
perpetual requests.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font face="Tahoma, serif"> </font></font><font face="Tahoma, serif">”

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the Lord said, <font color="#a80000">“Listen
to the words of the unjust judge. Will not God bring about justice
for His elect who cry out to Him day and night? Will He continue to
defer their help? I tell you, He will promptly carry out justice on
their behalf. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find
faith on earth?”</font> </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">To some who trusted in their own
righteousness and viewed others with contempt, He also told this
parable: <font color="#a80000">“Two men went up to the temple to
pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee
stood by himself and prayed, ‘God, I thank You that I am not like
the other men—swindlers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this
tax collector. I fast twice a week and pay tithes of all that I
acquire.’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">But the tax
collector stood at a distance, unwilling even to lift up his eyes to
heaven. Instead, he beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on
me, a sinner!’ I tell you, this man, rather than the Pharisee, went
home justified. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but
the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” </font></font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus called the children to Him and
said, <font color="#a80000">“Let the little children come to Me,

these. Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of
God like a little child will never enter it.”</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Why do you call
Me good?”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“No one is

adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness,
honor your father and mother.’”</font> </font>
