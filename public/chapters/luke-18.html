<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Persistent Widow</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray at all times and not lose heart:
<span><span class="reftext">2</span>“In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected men.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And there was a widow in that town who kept appealing to him, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">4</span>For a while he refused, but later he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect men,
<span class="reftext">5</span>yet because this widow keeps pestering me, I will give her justice. Then she will stop wearing me out with her perpetual requests.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>And the Lord said, <span>“Listen to the words of the unjust judge.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry out to Him day and night? Will He continue to defer their help?
<span class="reftext">8</span>I tell you, He will promptly carry out justice on their behalf. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Pharisee and the Tax Collector</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>To some who trusted in their own righteousness and viewed others with contempt, He also told this parable:
<span><span class="reftext">10</span>“Two men went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
<span class="reftext">11</span>The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed,<span class="fn">a</span>  ‘God, I thank You that I am not like the other men—swindlers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.
<span class="reftext">12</span>I fast twice a week and pay tithes of all that I acquire.’</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">13</span>But the tax collector stood at a distance, unwilling even to lift up his eyes to heaven. Instead, he beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner!’
<span class="reftext">14</span>I tell you, this man, rather than the Pharisee, went home justified. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Blesses the Children<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 19:13–15; Mark 10:13–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now people were even bringing their babies to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them. And when the disciples saw this, they rebuked those who brought them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>But Jesus called the children to Him and said, <span>“Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Rich Young Ruler<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 19:16–30; Mark 10:17–31)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then a certain ruler asked Him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">19</span>“Why do you call Me good?”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“No one is good except God alone.
<span class="reftext">20</span>You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> your father and mother.’<span class="fn">b</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>“All these I have kept from my youth,” he said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>On hearing this, Jesus told him, <span>“You still lack one thing: Sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But when the ruler heard this, he became very sad, because he was extremely wealthy.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Seeing the man’s sadness,<span class="fn">c</span>  Jesus said, <span>“How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!
<span class="reftext">25</span>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>But Jesus said, <span>“What is impossible with man is possible with God.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>“Look,” said Peter, “we have left all we had<span class="fn">d</span>  to follow You.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">29</span>“Truly I tell you,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
<span class="reftext">30</span>will fail to receive many times more in this age—and in the age to come, eternal life.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Third Prediction of the Passion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 20:17–19; Mark 10:32–34)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then Jesus took the Twelve aside and said to them, <span>“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything the prophets have written about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
<span class="reftext">32</span>He will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.
<span class="reftext">33</span>They will flog Him and kill Him, and on the third day He will rise again.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>But the disciples did not understand any of these things. The meaning was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend what He was saying.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals a Blind Beggar<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 20:29–34; Mark 10:46–52)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>As Jesus drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting beside the road, begging.
<span class="reftext">36</span>When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>“Jesus of Nazareth is passing by,” they told him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Those who led the way admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Jesus stopped and directed that the man be brought to Him. When he had been brought near, Jesus asked him,
<span><span class="reftext">41</span>“What do you want Me to do for you?”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“Lord,” he said, “let me see again.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">42</span>“Receive your sight!”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“Your faith has healed you.”</span>
<span class="reftext">43</span>Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, glorifying God. And all the people who saw this gave praise to God.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">stood and prayed to himself</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Exodus 20:12–16; Deuteronomy 5:16–20<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Seeing that he had become sorrowful</i>; SBL, NE, and WH <i class="calibre6">Seeing him</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">left our own</i>; BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">left all</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
