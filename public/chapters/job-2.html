<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Job Loses His Health</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>On another day the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan<span class="fn">a</span>  also came with them to present himself before Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Where have you come from?” said the LORD to Satan. </p><p class="reg1">“From roaming through the earth,” he replied, “and walking back and forth in it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one on earth like him, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil. He still retains his integrity, even though you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give up all he owns in exchange for his life.
<span class="reftext">5</span>But stretch out Your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse You to Your face.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>“Very well,” said the LORD to Satan. “He is in your hands, but you must spare his life.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and infected Job with terrible boils from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself as he sat among the ashes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Job’s wife said to him, “Do you still retain your integrity? Curse<span class="fn">b</span>  God and die!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>“You speak as a foolish woman speaks,” he told her. “Should we accept from God only good and not adversity?” </p><p class="reg1"> In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
</p><p class="hdg">Job’s Three Friends</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now when Job’s three friends—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite—heard about all this adversity that had come upon him, each of them came from his home, and they met together to go and sympathize with Job and comfort him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>When they lifted up their eyes from afar, they could barely <span class='spell ca'>recognize</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognize</span> Job. They began to weep aloud, and each man tore his robe and threw dust in the air over his head.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw how intense his suffering was.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, <i class="calibre6">the Accuser</i> or <i class="calibre6">the Adversary</i>; here and throughout Job 2<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Bless</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
