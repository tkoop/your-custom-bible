<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Job Prepares His Case</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>“Indeed, my eyes have seen all this; </p><p class="indent"> my ears have heard and understood.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>What you know, I also know; </p><p class="indent"> I am not inferior to you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Yet I desire to speak to the Almighty </p><p class="indent"> and argue my case before God.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>You, however, smear with lies; </p><p class="indent"> you are all worthless physicians.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>If only you would remain silent; </p><p class="indent"> for that would be your wisdom!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Hear now my argument, </p><p class="indent"> and listen to the plea of my lips.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf </p><p class="indent"> or speak deceitfully for Him?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Would you show Him partiality </p><p class="indent"> or argue in His defence?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Would it be well when He examined you? </p><p class="indent"> Could you deceive Him like a man?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Surely He would rebuke you </p><p class="indent"> if you secretly showed partiality.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Would His majesty not terrify you? </p><p class="indent"> Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; </p><p class="indent"> your defences are defences of clay.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Be silent, and I will speak. </p><p class="indent"> Then let come to me what may.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Why do I put myself at risk<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and take my life in my own hands?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Though He slay me, I will hope in Him.<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> I will still defend my ways to His face.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Moreover, this will be my salvation, </p><p class="indent"> for no godless man can appear before Him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Listen carefully to my words; </p><p class="indent"> let my declaration ring in your ears.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Behold, now that I have prepared my case, </p><p class="indent"> I know that I will be vindicated.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Can anyone indict me? </p><p class="indent"> If so, I will be silent and die.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Only grant these two things to me, </p><p class="indent"> so that I need not hide from You:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Withdraw Your hand from me, </p><p class="indent"> and do not let Your terror frighten me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then call me, and I will answer, </p><p class="indent"> or let me speak, and You can reply.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>How many are my iniquities and sins? </p><p class="indent"> Reveal to me my transgression and sin.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Why do You hide Your face </p><p class="indent"> and consider me as Your enemy?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Would You frighten a windblown leaf? </p><p class="indent"> Would You chase after dry chaff?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>For You record bitter accusations against me </p><p class="indent"> and bequeath to me the iniquities of my youth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>You put my feet in the stocks </p><p class="indent"> and stand watch over all my paths; </p><p class="indent1"> You set a limit </p><p class="indent"> for the soles of my feet.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">28</span>So man wastes away like something rotten, </p><p class="indent"> like a moth-eaten garment.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Why do I take my flesh in my teeth</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">I have no other hope</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
