<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Living Stone and Chosen People<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 28:14–22; 1 Corinthians 3:10–15; Ephesians 2:19–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Rid yourselves, therefore, of all malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,
<span class="reftext">3</span>now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>As you come to Him, the living stone, rejected by men but chosen and precious in God’s sight,
<span class="reftext">5</span>you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext">6</span>For it stands in Scripture: </p><p class="indent1stline">“See, I lay in Zion a stone, </p><p class="indent"> a chosen and precious cornerstone; </p><p class="indent1"> and the one who believes in Him </p><p class="indent"> will never be put to shame.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>To you who believe, then, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, </p><p class="indent1stline">“The stone the builders rejected </p><p class="indent"> has become the cornerstone,”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>and, </p><p class="indent1stline">“A stone of stumbling </p><p class="indent"> and a rock of offence.”<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> They stumble because they disobey the word—and to this they were appointed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, to proclaim the virtues of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Beloved, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from the desires of the flesh, which war against your soul.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Conduct yourselves with such honour among the Gentiles that, though they slander you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day He visits us.
</p><p class="hdg">Submission to Authorities<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Romans 13:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether to the king as the supreme authority,
<span class="reftext">14</span>or to governors as those sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorance of foolish men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Live in freedom, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Treat everyone with high regard: Love the brotherhood of believers,<span class="fn">e</span>  fear God, honour the king.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Servants, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect,<span class="fn">f</span>  not only to those who are good and gentle, but even to those who are unreasonable.
<span class="reftext">19</span>For if anyone endures the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God, this is to be commended.
<span class="reftext">20</span>How is it to your credit if you are beaten for doing wrong and you endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.
</p><p class="hdg">Christ’s Example of Suffering<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 53:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in His footsteps:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>“He committed no sin, </p><p class="indent"> and no deceit was found in His mouth.”<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When they heaped abuse on Him, </p><p class="indent"> He did not retaliate; </p><p class="indent1"> when He suffered, He made no threats, </p><p class="indent"> but entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>He Himself bore our sins<span class="fn">h</span>  </p><p class="indent"> in His body on the tree, </p><p class="indent1"> so that we might die to sin </p><p class="indent"> and live to righteousness. </p><p class="indent1">“By His stripes you are healed.”<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>For “you were like sheep going astray,”<span class="fn">j</span>  but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Isaiah 28:16 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Psalm 118:22<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Isaiah 8:14<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hosea 2:23<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Love the brotherhood</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in all fear</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Isaiah 53:9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Isaiah 53:4 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Isaiah 53:5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Isaiah 53:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
