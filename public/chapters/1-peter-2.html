<font >Beloved, I urge you, as foreigners and

<font >Servants, submit yourselves to your
masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle,
but even to those who are unreasonable. For if anyone endures the
pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God, this is to

wrong and you endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you
endure it, this is commendable before God. </font>
