<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Paul’s Concern for the Jews</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>I speak the truth in Christ; I am not lying, as confirmed by my conscience in the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>.
<span class="reftext">2</span>I have deep sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
<span class="reftext">3</span>For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my own flesh and blood,
<span class="reftext">4</span>the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory and the covenants; theirs the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them proceeds the human descent of Christ, who is God over all, forever worthy of praise!<span class="fn">a</span>  Amen.
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Sovereign Choice<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Genesis 25:19–28; Malachi 1:1–5)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>It is not as though God’s word has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Nor because they are Abraham’s descendants are they all his children. On the contrary, “Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">8</span>So it is not the children of the flesh who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as offspring.
<span class="reftext">9</span>For this is what the promise stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Not only that, but Rebecca’s children were conceived by one man, our father Isaac.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Yet before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God’s plan of election might stand,
<span class="reftext">12</span>not by works but by <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> who calls, she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">13</span>So it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Certainly not!
<span class="reftext">15</span>For <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> says to Moses: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, </p><p class="indent"> and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So then, it does not depend on man’s desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For the <span class='cap'>Scripture</span><span class='nocap'>scripture</span> says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> power in you, and that <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”<span class="fn">g</span> 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Therefore God has mercy on whom <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> wants to have mercy, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> hardens whom <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> wants to harden.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>One of you will say to me, “Then why does God still find fault? For who can resist <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> will?”
<span class="reftext">20</span>But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> who formed it, “Why did <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> make me like this?”<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Does not the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special occasions and another for common use?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>What if God, intending to show <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> wrath and make <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> power known, bore with great patience the vessels of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> wrath, prepared for destruction?
<span class="reftext">23</span>What if <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> did this to make the riches of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> glory known to the vessels of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mercy, whom <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> prepared in advance for glory—
<span class="reftext">24</span>including us, whom <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has called not only from the Jews, but also from the Gentiles?
<span class="reftext">25</span>As <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> says in Hosea: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I will call them ‘My People’ who are not <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people, </p><p class="indent"> and I will call her ‘My <span class='cap'>Beloved</span><span class='nocap'>beloved</span>’ who is not <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> beloved,”<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>and, </p><p class="indent1stline">“It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, </p><p class="indent">‘<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are not <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people,’ </p><p class="indent1"> they will be called </p><p class="indent">‘sons of the living God.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”<span class="fn">j</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Though the number of the Israelites is like the sand of the sea, </p><p class="indent"> only the remnant will be saved.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>For the Lord will carry out <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> sentence on the earth </p><p class="indent"> thoroughly and decisively.”<span class="fn">k</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>It is just as Isaiah foretold: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us descendants, </p><p class="indent"> we would have become like Sodom, </p><p class="indent"> we would have resembled Gomorrah.”<span class="fn">l</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Israel’s Unbelief</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>What then will we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;
<span class="reftext">31</span>but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Why not? Because their pursuit was not by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,
