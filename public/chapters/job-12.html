<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Job Presents His Case</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Job answered:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Truly then you are the people </p><p class="indent"> with whom wisdom itself will die!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But I also have a mind; </p><p class="indent"> I am not inferior to you. </p><p class="indent"> Who does not know such things as these?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>I am a laughingstock to my friends, </p><p class="indent"> though I called on God, and He answered. </p><p class="indent"> The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The one at ease scorns misfortune </p><p class="indent"> as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>The tents of robbers are safe, </p><p class="indent"> and those who provoke God are secure—</p><p class="indent"> those who carry their god in their hands.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>But ask the animals, and they will instruct you; </p><p class="indent"> ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; </p><p class="indent"> let the fish of the sea inform you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Which of all these does not know </p><p class="indent"> that the hand of the LORD has done this?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>The life of every living thing is in His hand, </p><p class="indent"> as well as the breath of all mankind.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Does not the ear test words </p><p class="indent"> as the tongue tastes its food?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Wisdom is found with the elderly, </p><p class="indent"> and understanding comes with long life.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Wisdom and strength belong to God; </p><p class="indent"> counsel and understanding are His.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>What He tears down cannot be rebuilt; </p><p class="indent"> the man He imprisons cannot be released.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>If He holds back the waters, they dry up, </p><p class="indent"> and if He releases them, they overwhelm the land.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>True wisdom and power belong to Him. </p><p class="indent"> The deceived and the deceiver are His.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>He leads counsellors away barefoot </p><p class="indent"> and makes fools of judges.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>He loosens the bonds placed by kings </p><p class="indent"> and fastens a belt around their waists.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>He leads priests away barefoot </p><p class="indent"> and overthrows the established.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>He deprives the trusted of speech </p><p class="indent"> and takes away the discernment of elders.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>He pours out contempt on nobles </p><p class="indent"> and disarms the mighty.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>He reveals the deep things of darkness </p><p class="indent"> and brings deep shadows into light.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>He makes nations great and destroys them; </p><p class="indent"> He enlarges nations, then disperses them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>He deprives the earth’s leaders of reason </p><p class="indent"> and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>They grope in the darkness without light; </p><p class="indent"> He makes them stagger like drunkards.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">though God keeps them in His power</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
