<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Put On the New Self<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Ephesians 4:17–32)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore, since you have been raised with Christ, strive for the things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
<span class="reftext">3</span>For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
<span class="reftext">4</span>When Christ, who is your<span class="fn">a</span>  life, appears, then you also will appear with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in glory.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Put to death, therefore, the components of your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires, and greed, which is idolatry.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Because of these, the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">7</span>When you lived among them, you also used to walk in these ways.
<span class="reftext">8</span>But now you must put aside all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Do not lie to one another, since you have taken off the old self with its practices,
<span class="reftext">10</span>and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its <span class='cap'>Creator</span><span class='nocap'>creator</span>.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free, but Christ is all and is in all.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with hearts of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Bear with one another and forgive any complaint you may have against someone else. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And over all these virtues put on love, which is the bond of perfect unity.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, for to this you were called as members of one body. And be thankful.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And whatever you do, in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> through <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
</p><p class="hdg">Christian Households<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Ephesians 6:1–4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Fathers, do not provoke your children, so they will not become discouraged.
</p><p class="hdg">Serving with Honor<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Ephesians 6:5–9; 1 Timothy 6:1–2)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only to please them while they are watching, but with sincerity of heart and fear of the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Whatever you do, work at it with your whole being, for the Lord and not for men,
<span class="reftext">24</span>because you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as your reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Whoever does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> NE, WH, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">our</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> NE, WH, and Tischendorf do not include <i class="calibre6">on the sons of disobedience</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
