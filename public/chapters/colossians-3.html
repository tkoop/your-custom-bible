<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, since you have been raised with
Christ, strive for the things above, where Christ is seated at the
right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly
things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear
with Him in glory. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Put to death, therefore, the components of
your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires,
and greed, which is idolatry. Because of these, the wrath of God is
coming on the sons of disobedience. When you lived among them, you
also used to walk in these ways. But now you must put aside all such
things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language
from your lips. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not lie to one another, since you have
taken off the old self with its practices, and have put on the new
self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its
Creator. Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised,
barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free, but Christ is all and is in all.

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and
beloved, clothe yourselves with hearts of compassion, kindness,
humility, gentleness, and patience. Bear with one another and forgive
any complaint you may have against someone else. Forgive as the Lord
forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love, which is the
bond of perfect unity. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts,
for to this you were called as members of one body. And be thankful. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Let the word of Christ richly dwell within
you as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you
sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts
to God. And whatever you do, in word or deed, do it all in the name
of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him. </font>
