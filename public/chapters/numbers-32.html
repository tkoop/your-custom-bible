<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the Reubenites and Gadites, who had
very large herds and flocks, surveyed the lands of Jazer and Gilead,
and they saw that the region was suitable for livestock. So the
Gadites and Reubenites came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the
leaders of the congregation, and said, “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer,
Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, which the LORD
conquered before the congregation of Israel, are suitable for
livestock—and your servants have livestock.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">If we have found favor in your sight,”
they said, “let this land be given to your servants as a
possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Moses asked the Gadites and
Reubenites, “Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here? Why
are you discouraging the Israelites from crossing into the land that
the LORD has given them? This is what your fathers did when I sent
them from Kadesh-barnea to inspect the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For when your fathers went up to the
Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the Israelites
from entering the land that the LORD had given them. So the anger of
the LORD was kindled that day, and He swore an oath, saying, ‘Because
they did not follow Me wholeheartedly, not one of the men twenty
years of age or older who came out of Egypt will see the land that I
swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob— not one except Caleb son
of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun—because they did
follow the LORD wholeheartedly.’ The anger of the LORD burned
against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty
years, until the whole generation who had done evil in His sight was
gone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now behold, you, a brood of sinners, have
risen up in place of your fathers to further stoke the burning anger
of the LORD against Israel. For if you turn away from following Him,
He will once again leave this people in the wilderness, and you will
be the cause of their destruction.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Gadites and Reubenites approached
Moses and said, “We want to build sheepfolds here for our livestock
and cities for our little ones. But we will arm ourselves and be
ready to go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them into
their place. Meanwhile, our little ones will remain in the fortified
cities for protection from the inhabitants of the land. We will not
return to our homes until every Israelite has taken possession of his
inheritance. Yet we will not have an inheritance with them across the
Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on the east
side of the Jordan.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moses replied, “If you will do this—if
you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle, and if every one
of your armed men crosses the Jordan before the LORD, until He has
driven His enemies out before Him, then when the land is subdued
before the LORD, you may return and be free of obligation to the LORD
and to Israel. And this land will belong to you as a possession
before the LORD. But if you do not do this, you will certainly sin
against the LORD—and be assured that your sin will find you out.
Build cities for your little ones and folds for your flocks, but do
what you have promised.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses,
“Your servants will do just as our lord commands. Our children, our
wives, our livestock, and all our animals will remain here in the
cities of Gilead. But your servants are equipped for war, and every
man will cross over to the battle before the LORD, just as our lord
says.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar
the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the family leaders of the
tribes of Israel. And Moses said to them, “If the Gadites and
Reubenites cross the Jordan with you, with every man armed for battle
before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you are to
give them the land of Gilead as a possession. But if they do not arm
themselves and go across with you, then they must accept their
possession among you in the land of Canaan.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Gadites and Reubenites replied, “As
the LORD has spoken to your servants, so we will do. We will cross
over into the land of Canaan armed before the LORD, that we may have
our inheritance on this side of the Jordan.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Moses gave to the Gadites, to the
Reubenites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the
kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of
Bashan—the land including its cities and the territory surrounding
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth,
Aroer, Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran
as fortified cities, and they built folds for their flocks. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Reubenites built up Heshbon, Elealeh,
Kiriathaim, as well as Nebo and Baal-meon (whose names were changed),
and Sibmah. And they renamed the cities they rebuilt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh
went to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were
there. So Moses gave Gilead to the clan of Machir son of Manasseh,
and they settled there. Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, went and
captured their villages and called them Havvoth-jair. And Nobah went
and captured Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah, after his
own name. </font>
