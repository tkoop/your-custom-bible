<font ><b>Joshua’s Charge to Leaders</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A long time after the LORD had given
Israel rest from all the enemies around them, when Joshua was old and
well along in years, he summoned all Israel, including its elders,
leaders, judges, and officers. “I am old and well along in years,”
he said, “and you have seen everything that the LORD your God has
done to all these nations for your sake, because it was the LORD your
God who fought for you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >See, I have allotted as an inheritance to
your tribes these remaining nations, including all the nations I have
already cut off, from the Jordan westward to the Great Sea. The LORD
your God will push them out of your way and drive them out before
you, so that you can take possession of their land, as the LORD your
God promised you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Be very strong, then, so that you can keep
and obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, not
turning aside from it to the right or to the left. So you are not to
associate with these nations that remain among you. You must not call
on the names of their gods or swear by them, and you must not serve
them or bow down to them. Instead, you shall hold fast to the LORD
your God, as you have done to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD has driven out great and powerful
nations before you, and to this day no one can stand against you. One
of you can put a thousand to flight, because the LORD your God fights
for you, just as He promised. Therefore watch yourselves carefully,
that you love the LORD your God. For if you turn away and cling to
the rest of these nations that remain among you, and if you
intermarry and associate with them, know for sure that the LORD your
God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they
will become for you a snare and a trap, a scourge in your sides and
thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that the
LORD your God has given you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now behold, today I am going the way of
all the earth, and you know with all your heart and soul that not one
of the good promises the LORD your God made to you has failed.
Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed. But
just as every good thing the LORD your God promised you has come to
pass, likewise the LORD will bring upon you the calamity He has
threatened, until He has destroyed you from this good land He has
given you. If you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which
He commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them,
then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and you will
quickly perish from this good land He has given you.” </font>
