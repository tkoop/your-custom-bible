<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Joshua’s Charge to Leaders</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>A long time after <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had given Israel rest from all the enemies around them, when Joshua was old and well along in years,
<span class="reftext">2</span>he summoned all Israel, including its elders, leaders, judges, and officers. “I am old and well along in years,” he said,
<span class="reftext">3</span>“and you have seen everything that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has done to all these nations for your sake, because it was <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God who fought for you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>See, I have allotted as an inheritance to your tribes these remaining nations, including all the nations I have already cut off, from the Jordan westward to the Great Sea.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">5</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> your God will push them out of your way and drive them out before you, so that you can take possession of their land, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God promised you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Be very strong, then, so that you can keep and obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, not turning aside from it to the right or to the left.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So you are not to associate with these nations that remain among you. You must not call on the names of their gods or swear by them, and you must not serve them or bow down to them.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Instead, you shall hold fast to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, as you have done to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> has driven out great and powerful nations before you, and to this day no one can stand against you.
<span class="reftext">10</span>One of you can put a thousand to flight, because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God fights for you, just as He promised.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore watch yourselves carefully, that you love <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.
<span class="reftext">12</span>For if you turn away and cling to the rest of these nations that remain among you, and if you intermarry and associate with them,
<span class="reftext">13</span>know for sure that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they will become for you a snare and a trap, a scourge in your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has given you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know with all your heart and soul that not one of the good promises <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God made to you has failed. Everything was fulfilled for you; not one promise has failed.
<span class="reftext">15</span>But just as every good thing <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God promised you has come to pass, likewise <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will bring upon you the calamity He has threatened, until He has destroyed you from this good land He has given you.
<span class="reftext">16</span>If you transgress the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, which He commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from this good land He has given you.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the Mediterranean Sea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
