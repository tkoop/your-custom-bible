</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Be very strong, then, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> can keep and obey all that is written in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> of Moses, not turning aside from it to the right or to the left.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So you are not to associate with these nations that remain among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> must not call on the names of their gods or swear by them, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must not serve them or bow down to them.
