<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Job: How Can I Contend with God?</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Job answered:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Yes, I know that it is so, </p><p class="indent"> but how can a mortal be righteous before God?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>If one wished to contend with God,<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>God is wise in heart and mighty in strength. </p><p class="indent"> Who has resisted Him and prospered?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>He moves mountains without their knowledge </p><p class="indent"> and overturns them in His anger.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>He shakes the earth from its place, </p><p class="indent"> so that its foundations tremble.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>He commands the sun not to shine;<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> He seals off the stars.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>He alone stretches out the heavens </p><p class="indent"> and treads on the waves of the sea.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, </p><p class="indent"> of the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>He does great things beyond searching out, </p><p class="indent"> and wonders without number.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; </p><p class="indent"> were He to move, I would not recognize Him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>If He takes away,<span class="fn">c</span>  who can stop Him? </p><p class="indent"> Who dares to ask Him, ‘What are You doing?’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>God does not restrain His anger; </p><p class="indent"> the helpers of Rahab cower beneath Him.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>How then can I answer Him </p><p class="indent"> or choose my arguments against Him?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>For even if I were right, I could not answer. </p><p class="indent"> I could only beg my Judge for mercy.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>If I summoned Him and He answered me, </p><p class="indent"> I do not believe He would listen to my voice.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>For He would crush me with a tempest </p><p class="indent"> and multiply my wounds without cause.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>He does not let me catch my breath, </p><p class="indent"> but overwhelms me with bitterness.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>If it is a matter of strength, </p><p class="indent"> He is indeed mighty! </p><p class="indent1"> If it is a matter of justice, </p><p class="indent"> who can summon Him<span class="fn">d</span>?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Even if I were righteous, my mouth would condemn me; </p><p class="indent"> if I were blameless, it would declare me guilty.<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>Though I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; </p><p class="indent"> I despise my own life.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>It is all the same, and so I say, </p><p class="indent">‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When the scourge brings sudden death, </p><p class="indent"> He mocks the despair of the innocent.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; </p><p class="indent"> He blindfolds its judges. </p><p class="indent"> If it is not He, then who is it?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>My days are swifter than a runner; </p><p class="indent"> they flee without seeing good.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>They sweep by like boats of papyrus, </p><p class="indent"> like an eagle swooping down on its prey.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>If I were to say, ‘I will forget my complaint </p><p class="indent"> and change my expression and smile,’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>I would still dread all my sufferings; </p><p class="indent"> I know that You will not acquit me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Since I am already found guilty, </p><p class="indent"> why should I labor in vain?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>If I should wash myself with snow<span class="fn">f</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and cleanse my hands with lye,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>then You would plunge me into the pit, </p><p class="indent"> and even my own clothes would despise me.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">32</span>For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him, </p><p class="indent"> that we can take each other to court.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Nor is there a mediator between us, </p><p class="indent"> to lay his hand upon us both.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Let Him remove His rod from me, </p><p class="indent"> so that His terror will no longer frighten me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Then I would speak without fear of Him. </p><p class="indent"> But as it is, I am on my own.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">If God wished to contend with someone</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">rise</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">snatches someone in death</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> See LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">me</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">He would declare me guilty</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">soap</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
