</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>So Pilate questioned <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, “Are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> the King of the Jews?” </p><p class="reg1"><span>“You have said so,”</span> Jesus replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And the chief priests began to accuse <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> of many things.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Pilate questioned <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> again, “Have <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> no answer?

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But to Pilate’s amazement, Jesus made no further reply.

<span class="reftext">7</span>And a man named Barabbas was imprisoned with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection.
<span class="reftext">8</span>So the crowd went up and began asking Pilate to keep his custom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“Do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> want me to release to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> the King of the Jews?” Pilate asked.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas to them instead.
</p><p class="hdg">Pilate Delivers Up Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 27:24–26)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So Pilate asked them again, “What then do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> want me to do with the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> call the King of the Jews?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And they shouted back, “Crucify <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>“Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> done?” </p><p class="reg1"> But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> over to be crucified.
