<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jesus Delivered to Pilate<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 27:1–2)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Early in the morning, the chief priests, elders, scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin<span class="fn">a</span>  devised a plan. They bound Jesus, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>So Pilate questioned Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” </p><p class="reg1"><span>“You have said so,”</span> Jesus replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And the chief priests began to accuse Him of many things.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then Pilate questioned Him again, “Have You no answer? Look how many charges they are bringing against You!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But to Pilate’s amazement, Jesus made no further reply.
</p><p class="hdg">The Crowd Chooses Barabbas<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 27:15–23; Luke 23:13–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Now it was Pilate’s custom at the feast to release to the people<span class="fn">b</span>  a prisoner of their choosing.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And a man named Barabbas was imprisoned with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection.
<span class="reftext">8</span>So the crowd went up and began asking Pilate to keep his custom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” Pilate asked.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas to them instead.
</p><p class="hdg">Pilate Delivers Up Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 27:24–26)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So Pilate asked them again, “What then do you want me to do with the One you call the King of the Jews?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And they shouted back, “Crucify Him!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>“Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has He done?” </p><p class="reg1"> But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify Him!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed Him over to be crucified.
</p><p class="hdg">The Soldiers Mock Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 50:4–11; Matthew 27:27–31; Luke 22:63–65; John 19:1–15)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then the soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called the whole company together.
<span class="reftext">17</span>They dressed Him in a purple robe, twisted together a crown of thorns, and set it on His head.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And they began to salute Him: “Hail, King of the Jews!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>They kept striking His head with a staff and spitting on Him. And they knelt down and bowed before Him.
<span class="reftext">20</span>After they had mocked Him, they removed the purple robe and put His own clothes back on Him. Then they led Him out to crucify Him.
</p><p class="hdg">The Crucifixion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 22:1–31; Matthew 27:32–44; Luke 23:26–43; John 19:16–27)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Now Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and the soldiers forced him to carry the cross of Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull.
<span class="reftext">23</span>There they offered Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>And they crucified Him. </p><p class="reg1"> They also divided His garments by casting lots to decide what each of them would take.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>It was the third hour<span class="fn">d</span>  when they crucified Him.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And the charge inscribed against Him read: </p><p class="reg1"></p><div class="inscrip1"> THE KING OF THE JEWS.</div>
<p class="calibre3"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Along with Jesus, they crucified two robbers,<span class="fn">e</span>  one on His right and one on His left.<span class="fn">f</span> 

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>And those who passed by heaped abuse on Him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,
<span class="reftext">30</span>come down from the cross and save Yourself!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>In the same way, the chief priests and scribes mocked Him among themselves, saying, “He saved others, but He cannot save Himself!
<span class="reftext">32</span>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe!” And even those who were crucified with Him berated Him.
</p><p class="hdg">The Death of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 22:1–31; Matthew 27:45–56; Luke 23:44–49; John 19:28–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>From the sixth hour until the ninth hour<span class="fn">g</span>  darkness came over all the land.
<span class="reftext">34</span>At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, <span>“Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?”</span> which means, <span>“My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”</span><span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>When some of those standing nearby heard this, they said, “Behold, He is calling Elijah.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine.<span class="fn">i</span>  He put it on a reed and held it up for Jesus to drink,<span class="fn">j</span>  saying, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>But Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed His last.
<span class="reftext">38</span>And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>When the centurion standing there in front of Jesus saw how He had breathed His last,<span class="fn">k</span>  he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>And there were also women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses,<span class="fn">l</span>  and Salome.
<span class="reftext">41</span>These women had followed Jesus and ministered to Him while He was in Galilee, and there were many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with Him.
</p><p class="hdg">The Burial of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 53:9–12; Matthew 27:57–61; Luke 23:50–56; John 19:38–42)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>Now it was already evening. Since it was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath),
<span class="reftext">43</span>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent Council member who himself was waiting for the kingdom of God, boldly went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus was already dead, so he summoned the centurion to ask if this was so.
<span class="reftext">45</span>When Pilate had confirmed it with the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>So Joseph bought a linen cloth, took down the body of Jesus, wrapped it in the cloth, and placed it in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.
<span class="reftext">47</span>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph<span class="fn">m</span>  saw where His body was placed.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the whole Council</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Now at the feast he would release to them</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> See Psalm 22:18.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> That is, nine in the morning<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">insurrectionists</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6"><span class="fnv">28</span>So the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “And He was numbered with the transgressors.”</i> See Isaiah 53:12 and Luke 22:37.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> That is, from noon until three in the afternoon<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">34</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Psalm 22:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a sponge with wine vinegar</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> See Psalm 69:21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">39</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">saw how, having cried out, He had breathed His last</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">40</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> <i class="calibre6">Joses</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Joseph</i>; see Matthew 27:56.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">47</span> <span class="footnotesbot">m</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Joses</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
