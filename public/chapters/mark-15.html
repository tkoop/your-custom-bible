<font face="Tahoma, serif">Early in the morning, the chief priests,
elders, scribes, and the whole Sanhedrin devised a plan. They bound
Jesus, led Him away, and handed Him over to Pilate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Pilate questioned Him, “Are You the
King of the Jews?” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You have said
so,”</font> Jesus replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the chief priests began to accuse Him
of many things. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Pilate questioned Him again, “Have
You no answer? Look how many charges they are bringing against You!”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But to Pilate’s amazement, Jesus made no
further reply. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now it was Pilate’s custom at the feast
to release to the people a prisoner of their choosing. And a man
named Barabbas was imprisoned with the rebels who had committed
murder during the insurrection. So the crowd went up and began asking
Pilate to keep his custom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do you want me to release to you the
King of the Jews?” Pilate asked. For he knew it was out of envy
that the chief priests had handed Jesus over. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the chief priests stirred up the crowd
to have him release Barabbas to them instead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Pilate asked them again, “What then
do you want me to do with the One you call the King of the Jews?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And they shouted back, “Crucify Him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Why?” asked Pilate. “What evil has
He done?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify
Him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And wishing to satisfy the crowd, Pilate
released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed Him
over to be crucified. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the soldiers led Jesus away into the
palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called the whole company
together. They dressed Him in a purple robe, twisted together a crown
of thorns, and set it on His head. And they began to salute Him:
“Hail, King of the Jews!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They kept striking His head with a staff
and spitting on Him. And they knelt down and bowed before Him. After
they had mocked Him, they removed the purple robe and put His own
clothes back on Him. Then they led Him out to crucify Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Simon of Cyrene, the father of
Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country,
and the soldiers forced him to carry the cross of Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They brought Jesus to a place called
Golgotha, which means The Place of the Skull. There they offered Him
wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And they crucified Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They also divided His garments by casting
lots to decide what each of them would take. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">It was the third hour when they crucified
Him. And the charge inscribed against Him read: </font>

<span style="text-transform: uppercase"><font face="Tahoma, serif">THE

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Along with Jesus, they crucified two
robbers, one on His right and one on His left. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And those who passed by heaped abuse on
Him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who are going to
destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, come down from the
cross and save Yourself!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the same way, the chief priests and
scribes mocked Him among themselves, saying, “He saved others, but
He cannot save Himself! Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down
now from the cross, so that we may see and believe!” And even those
who were crucified with Him berated Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">From the sixth hour until the ninth hour
darkness came over all the land. At the ninth hour, Jesus cried out
in a loud voice, <font color="#a80000">“Eloi, Eloi, lema
sabachthani?”</font> which means, <font color="#a80000">“My God,
My God, why have You forsaken Me?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When some of those standing nearby heard
this, they said, “Behold, He is calling Elijah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And someone ran and filled a sponge with
sour wine. He put it on a reed and held it up for Jesus to drink,
saying, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him
down.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed
His last. And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to
bottom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the centurion standing there in front
of Jesus saw how He had breathed His last, he said, “Truly this man
was the Son of God!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And there were also women watching from a
distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James
the younger and of Joses, and Salome. These women had followed Jesus
and ministered to Him while He was in Galilee, and there were many
other women who had come up to Jerusalem with Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now it was already evening. Since it was
Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath), Joseph of
Arimathea, a prominent Council member who himself was waiting for the
kingdom of God, boldly went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Pilate was surprised to hear that Jesus
was already dead, so he summoned the centurion to ask if this was so.
When Pilate had confirmed it with the centurion, he granted the body
to Joseph. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Joseph bought a linen cloth, took down
the body of Jesus, wrapped it in the cloth, and placed it in a tomb
that had been cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the
entrance to the tomb. Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph
saw where His body was placed. </font>
