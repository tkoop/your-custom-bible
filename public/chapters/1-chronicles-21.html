<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>David’s Military Census</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Satan rose up against Israel and
incited David to take a census of Israel. So David said to Joab and
the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the Israelites from
Beersheba to Dan and bring me a report, so that I may know their
number.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Joab replied, “May the LORD multiply
His troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all
servants of my lord? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he
bring guilt on Israel?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed
against Joab. So Joab departed and traveled throughout Israel, and
then he returned to Jerusalem. And Joab reported to David the total
number of the troops. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew
the sword, including 470,000 in Judah. But Joab did not include Levi
and Benjamin in the count, because the king’s command was
detestable to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This command was also evil in the sight of
God; so He struck Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David said to God, “I have sinned
greatly because I have done this thing. Now I beg You to take away
the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD instructed Gad, David’s
seer, “Go and tell David that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am
offering you three options. Choose one of them, and I will carry it
out against you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Gad went and said to David, “This is
what the LORD says: ‘You must choose between three years of famine,
three months of being swept away before your enemies and overtaken by
their swords, or three days of the sword of the LORD—days of plague
upon the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of
Israel.’ Now then, decide how I should reply to Him who sent me.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">David answered Gad, “I am deeply
distressed. Please, let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for His
mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of
men.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and
seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then God sent an angel to destroy
Jerusalem, but as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and
relented from the calamity, and He said to the angel who was
destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand now!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time the angel of the LORD was
standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When David lifted up his eyes and saw the
angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn
sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders,
clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown. And David said to God, “Was it
not I who gave the order to count the people? I am the one who has
sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? O
LORD my God, please let Your hand fall upon me and my father’s
house, but do not let this plague remain upon Your people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to
tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing
floor of Ornan the Jebusite. So David went up at the word that Gad
had spoken in the name of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Ornan was threshing wheat when he
turned and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid
themselves. David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked out and saw
David, he left the threshing floor and bowed facedown before David. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the
site of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to the LORD.
Sell it to me for the full price, so that the plague upon the people
may be halted.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ornan said to David, “My lord the king
may take whatever seems good. Look, I will give the oxen for the
burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat
for the grain offering—I will give it all.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">No,” replied King David, “I insist
on paying the full price, for I will not take for the LORD what
belongs to you, nor will I offer burnt offerings that cost me
nothing.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of
gold for the site. And there he built an altar to the LORD and
offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called upon the LORD,
who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt
offering. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD spoke to the angel, who put
his sword back into its sheath. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time, when David saw that the LORD
had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he
offered sacrifices there. For the tabernacle of the LORD that Moses
had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were
presently at the high place in Gibeon, but David could not go before
it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel
of the LORD. </font>
