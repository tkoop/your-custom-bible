<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">David’s Military Census<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 30:11–16; 2 Samuel 24:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Satan<span class="fn">a</span>  rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.
<span class="reftext">2</span>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan and bring me a report, so that I may know their number.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But Joab replied, “May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> multiply <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all servants of my lord? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> throughout Israel, and then he returned to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And Joab reported to David the total number of the troops. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, including 470,000 in Judah.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count, because the king’s command was detestable to him.
</p><p class="hdg">Judgment for David’s Sin<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Samuel 24:10–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>This command was also evil in the sight of God; so <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> struck Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now I beg <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> to take away the iniquity of <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> instructed Gad, David’s seer,
<span class="reftext">10</span>“Go and tell David that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘I am offering you three options. Choose one of them, and I will carry it out against you.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So Gad went and said to David, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘You must choose
<span class="reftext">12</span>between three years of famine, three months of being swept away<span class="fn">b</span>  before your enemies and overtaken by their swords, or three days of the sword of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>—days of plague upon the land, with the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> ravaging every part of Israel.’ Now then, decide how I should reply to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> who sent me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>David answered Gad, “I am deeply distressed. Please, let me fall into the hand of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, for <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.”
</p><p class="hdg">A Plague on Israel<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Samuel 24:15–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but as the angel was doing so, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> saw it and relented from the calamity, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand now!” </p><p class="reg1"> At that time the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan<span class="fn">c</span>  the Jebusite.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave the order to count the people? I<span class="fn">d</span>  am the one who has sinned and acted wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span> my God, please let <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> hand fall upon me and my father’s house, but do not let this plague remain upon <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> people.”
</p><p class="hdg">David Builds an Altar<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Samuel 24:18–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<span class="reftext">19</span>So David went up at the word that Gad had spoken in the name of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now Ornan was threshing wheat when he turned and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
<span class="reftext">21</span>David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked out and saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed facedown before David.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then David said to Ornan, “Grant me the site of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. Sell it to me for the full price, so that the plague upon the people may be halted.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Ornan said to David, “My lord the king may take whatever seems good. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering—I will give it all.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>“No,” replied King David, “I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> what belongs to you, nor will I offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold<span class="fn">e</span>  for the site.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And there he built an altar to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called upon <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, who answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> spoke to the angel, who put his sword back into its sheath.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>At that time, when David saw that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.
<span class="reftext">29</span>For the tabernacle of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> that Moses had made in the wilderness and the altar of burnt offering were presently at the high place in Gibeon,
<span class="reftext">30</span>but David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, <i class="calibre6">the Accuser</i> or <i class="calibre6">the Adversary</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew; LXX and Vulgate <i class="calibre6">of fleeing</i>; see 2 Samuel 24:13.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Ornan</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Araunah</i>; also in verses 18–28; see 2 Samuel 24:16.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">I, the shepherd,</i> see 2 Samuel 24:17 DSS and LXX.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">600 shekels</i> is approximately 15.1 pounds or 6.8 kilograms of gold.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
