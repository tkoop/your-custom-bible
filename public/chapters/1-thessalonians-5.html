<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Day of the Lord<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Zephaniah 1:7–18; Malachi 4:1–6; 2 Peter 3:8–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now about the times and seasons, brothers, we do not need to write to you.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For you are fully aware that the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
<span class="reftext">3</span>While people are saying, “Peace and security,” destruction will come upon them suddenly, like labour pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But you, brothers, are not in the darkness so that this day should overtake you like a thief.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day; we do not belong to the night or to the darkness.
<span class="reftext">6</span>So then, let us not sleep as the others do, but let us remain awake and sober.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For those who sleep, sleep at night; and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.
<span class="reftext">8</span>But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and the helmet of our hope of salvation.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>For God has not appointed us to suffer wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext">10</span>He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore encourage and build one another up, just as you are already doing.
</p><p class="hdg">Christian Living</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge those who work diligently among you, who preside over you in the Lord and give you instruction.
<span class="reftext">13</span>In love, hold them in highest regard because of their work. Live in peace with one another.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And we urge you, brothers, to admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, and be patient with everyone.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Make sure that no one repays evil for evil. Always pursue what is good for one another and for all people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Rejoice at all times.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Pray without ceasing.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Give thanks in every circumstance, for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Do not extinguish the Spirit.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Do not treat prophecies with contempt,
<span class="reftext">21</span>but test all things. Hold fast to what is good.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Abstain from every form of evil.
</p><p class="hdg">Final Blessings and Instructions</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your entire spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless<span class="fn">a</span>  at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext">24</span>The One who calls you is faithful, and He will do it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Brothers, pray for us as well.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.<span class="fn">b</span> </p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">may your spirit, soul, and body be kept entirely blameless</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">Amen.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
