<font ><b>The Day of the Lord</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now about the times and seasons, brothers,
we do not need to write to you. For you are fully aware that the Day
of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are
saying, “Peace and security,” destruction will come upon them
suddenly, like labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not
escape. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But you, brothers, are not in the darkness
so that this day should overtake you like a thief. For you are all
sons of the light and sons of the day; we do not belong to the night
or to the darkness. So then, let us not sleep as the others do, but
let us remain awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night;
and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to
the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and
love, and the helmet of our hope of salvation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For God has not appointed us to suffer
wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died
for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together
with Him. Therefore encourage and build one another up, just as you
are already doing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But we ask you, brothers, to acknowledge
those who work diligently among you, who preside over you in the Lord
and give you instruction. In love, hold them in highest regard
because of their work. Live in peace with one another. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And we urge you, brothers, to admonish the
unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, and be patient
with everyone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make sure that no one repays evil for
evil. Always pursue what is good for one another and for all people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Rejoice at all times. Pray without
ceasing. Give thanks in every circumstance, for this is God’s will
for you in Christ Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not extinguish the Spirit. Do not treat
prophecies with contempt, but test all things. Hold fast to what is
good. Abstain from every form of evil. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify
you completely, and may your entire spirit, soul, and body be kept
blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The One who calls
you is faithful, and He will do it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Brothers, pray for us as well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I charge you before the Lord to have this
letter read to all the brothers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
you. </font>
