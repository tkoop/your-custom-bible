<font ><b>Jacob Meets Rachel</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jacob resumed his journey and came to the
land of the people of the east. He looked and saw a well in the
field, and near it lay three flocks of sheep, because the sheep were
watered from this well. And a large stone covered the mouth of the
well. When all the flocks had been gathered there, the shepherds
would roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the
sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth
of the well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >My brothers,” Jacob asked the
shepherds, “where are you from?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >We are from Haran,” they answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Do you know Laban the grandson of
Nahor?” Jacob asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >We know him,” they replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Is he well?” Jacob inquired. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Yes,” they answered, “and here
comes his daughter Rachel with his sheep.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Look,” said Jacob, “it is still
broad daylight; it is not yet time to gather the livestock. Water the
sheep and take them back to pasture.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But they replied, “We cannot, until all
the flocks have been gathered and the stone has been rolled away from
the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While he was still speaking with them,
Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
As soon as Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his mother’s brother
Laban, with Laban’s sheep, he went up and rolled the stone away
from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle’s sheep. Then
Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. He told Rachel that he was
Rebekah’s son, a relative of her father, and she ran and told her
father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Laban heard the news about his
sister’s son Jacob, he ran out to meet him. He embraced him and
kissed him and brought him to his home, where Jacob told him all that
had happened. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Laban declared, “You are indeed my
own flesh and blood.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Jacob had stayed with him a month,
Laban said to him, “Just because you are my relative, should you
work for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Laban had two daughters; the older was
named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel. Leah had weak eyes, but
Rachel was shapely and beautiful. Since Jacob loved Rachel, he
answered, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter
Rachel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Laban replied, “Better that I give her
to you than to another. Stay here with me.” So Jacob served seven
years for Rachel, yet it seemed but a few days because of his love
for her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Finally Jacob said to Laban, “Grant me
my wife, for my time is complete, and I want to sleep with her.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Laban invited all the men of that place
and prepared a feast. But when evening came, Laban took his daughter
Leah and gave her to Jacob, and he slept with her. And Laban gave his
servant girl Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maidservant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When morning came, there was Leah! “What
have you done to me?” Jacob said to Laban. “Wasn’t it for
Rachel that I served you? Why have you deceived me?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Laban replied, “It is not our custom
here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older.
Finish this week’s celebration, and we will give you the younger
one in return for another seven years of work.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jacob did just that. He finished the
week’s celebration, and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his
wife. Laban also gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel
as her maidservant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jacob slept with Rachel as well, and
indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah. So he worked for Laban
another seven years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved,
He opened her womb; but Rachel was barren. And Leah conceived and
gave birth to a son, and she named him Reuben, for she said, “The
LORD has seen my affliction. Surely my husband will love me now.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again she conceived and gave birth to a
son, and she said, “Because the LORD has heard that I am unloved,
He has given me this son as well.” So she named him Simeon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once again Leah conceived and gave birth
to a son, and she said, “Now at last my husband will become
attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was
named Levi. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And once more she conceived and gave birth
to a son and said, “This time I will praise the LORD.” So she
named him Judah. Then Leah stopped having children. </font>
