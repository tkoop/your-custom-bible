<font ><b>The Sons of Aaron</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the account of Aaron and Moses at
the time the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These are the names of the sons of Aaron:
Nadab the firstborn, then Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. These were
Aaron’s sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as
priests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nadab and Abihu, however, died in the
presence of the LORD when they offered unauthorized fire before the
LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai. And since they had no sons, only
Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their
father Aaron. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Bring the
tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
They are to perform duties for him and for the whole congregation
before the Tent of Meeting, attending to the service of the
tabernacle. They shall take care of all the furnishings of the Tent
of Meeting and fulfill obligations for the Israelites by attending to
the service of the tabernacle. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons;
they have been given exclusively to him from among the Israelites. So
you shall appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the
priesthood; but any outsider who approaches the tabernacle must be
put to death.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
“Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel
in place of every firstborn Israelite from the womb. The Levites
belong to Me, for all the firstborn are Mine. On the day I struck
down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated to Myself
all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They are Mine; I am
the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the
Wilderness of Sinai, saying, “Number the Levites by their families
and clans. You are to count every male a month old or more.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses numbered them according to the
word of the LORD, as he had been commanded. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These were the sons of Levi by name:
Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. These were the names of the sons of
Gershon by their clans: Libni and Shimei. The sons of Kohath by their
clans were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. And the sons of Merari
by their clans were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of the
Levites, according to their families. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From Gershon came the Libnite clan and the
Shimeite clan; these were the Gershonite clans. The number of all the
males a month old or more was 7,500. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Gershonite clans were to camp on the
west, behind the tabernacle, and the leader of the families of the
Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The duties of the Gershonites at the Tent
of Meeting were the tabernacle and tent, its covering, the curtain
for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the curtains of the
courtyard, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard that
surrounds the tabernacle and altar, and the cords—all the service
for these items. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From Kohath came the clans of the
Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites; these
were the clans of the Kohathites. The number of all the males a month
old or more was 8,600. They were responsible for the duties of the
sanctuary. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The clans of the Kohathites were to camp
on the south side of the tabernacle, and the leader of the families
of the Kohathites was Elizaphan son of Uzziel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Their duties were the ark, the table, the
lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used with them,
and the curtain—all the service for these items. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The chief of the leaders of the Levites
was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest; he oversaw those responsible for
the duties of the sanctuary. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From Merari came the clans of the Mahlites
and Mushites; these were the Merarite clans. The number of all the
males a month old or more was 6,200. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The leader of the families of the
Merarites was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north
side of the tabernacle. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The duties assigned to the sons of Merari
were the tabernacle’s frames, crossbars, posts, bases, and all its
equipment—all the service for these items, as well as the posts of
the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses, Aaron, and Aaron’s sons were to
camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, before the
Tent of Meeting. They were to perform the duties of the sanctuary as
a service on behalf of the Israelites; but any outsider who
approached the sanctuary was to be put to death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The total number of Levites that Moses and
Aaron counted by their clans at the LORD’s command, including all
the males a month old or more, was 22,000. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Number
every firstborn male of the Israelites a month old or more, and list
their names. You are to take the Levites for Me—I am the LORD—in
place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the
Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the
Israelites.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses numbered all the firstborn of the
Israelites, as the LORD had commanded him. The total number of the
firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
“Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the
livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites
belong to Me; I am the LORD. To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites
who outnumber the Levites, you are to collect five shekels for each
one, according to the sanctuary shekel of twenty gerahs. Give the
money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for the excess
among the Israelites.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses collected the redemption money
from those in excess of the number redeemed by the Levites. He
collected the money from the firstborn of the Israelites: 1,365
shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel. And Moses gave the
redemption money to Aaron and his sons in obedience to the word of
the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him. </font>
