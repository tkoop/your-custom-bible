<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Sons of Aaron<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Leviticus 10:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is the account of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, then Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
<span class="reftext">3</span>These were Aaron’s sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Nadab and Abihu, however, died in the presence of the LORD when they offered unauthorized<span class="fn">a</span>  fire before the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai. And since they had no sons, only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.
</p><p class="hdg">The Duties of the Levites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then the LORD said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">6</span>“Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
<span class="reftext">7</span>They are to perform duties for him and for the whole congregation before the Tent of Meeting, attending to the service of the tabernacle.
<span class="reftext">8</span>They shall take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting and fulfill obligations for the Israelites by attending to the service of the tabernacle.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they have been given exclusively to him<span class="fn">b</span>  from among the Israelites.
<span class="reftext">10</span>So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood; but any outsider who approaches the tabernacle must be put to death.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<span class="reftext">12</span>“Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel in place of every firstborn Israelite from the womb. The Levites belong to Me,
<span class="reftext">13</span>for all the firstborn are Mine. On the day I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They are Mine; I am the LORD.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Numbering of the Levites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, saying,
<span class="reftext">15</span>“Number the Levites by their families and clans. You are to count every male a month old or more.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he had been commanded.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>These were the sons of Levi by name: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
<span class="reftext">18</span>These were the names of the sons of Gershon by their clans: Libni and Shimei.
<span class="reftext">19</span>The sons of Kohath by their clans were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the sons of Merari by their clans were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of the Levites, according to their families.
</p><p class="hdg">The Gershonites<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 4:21–28; 1 Chronicles 23:7–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>From Gershon came the Libnite clan and the Shimeite clan; these were the Gershonite clans.
<span class="reftext">22</span>The number of all the males a month old or more was 7,500.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle,
<span class="reftext">24</span>and the leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>The duties of the Gershonites at the Tent of Meeting were the tabernacle and tent, its covering, the curtain for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
<span class="reftext">26</span>the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle and altar, and the cords—all the service for these items.
</p><p class="hdg">The Kohathites<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 4:1–20; 1 Chronicles 23:12–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>From Kohath came the clans of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites; these were the clans of the Kohathites.
<span class="reftext">28</span>The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600.<span class="fn">c</span>  They were responsible for the duties of the sanctuary.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>The clans of the Kohathites were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle,
<span class="reftext">30</span>and the leader of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan<span class="fn">d</span>  son of Uzziel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Their duties were the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used with them, and the curtain—all the service for these items.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>The chief of the leaders of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron the priest; he oversaw those responsible for the duties of the sanctuary.
</p><p class="hdg">The Merarites<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 4:29–33; 1 Chronicles 23:21–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>From Merari came the clans of the Mahlites and Mushites; these were the Merarite clans.
<span class="reftext">34</span>The number of all the males a month old or more was 6,200.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>The leader of the families of the Merarites was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>The duties assigned to the sons of Merari were the tabernacle’s frames, crossbars, posts, bases, and all its equipment—all the service for these items,
<span class="reftext">37</span>as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, and ropes.
</p><p class="hdg">Moses and Aaron</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>Moses, Aaron, and Aaron’s sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, before the Tent of Meeting. They were to perform the duties of the sanctuary as a service on behalf of the Israelites; but any outsider who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>The total number of Levites that Moses and Aaron counted by their clans at the LORD’s command, including all the males a month old or more, was 22,000.
</p><p class="hdg">The Redemption of the Firstborn</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Number every firstborn male of the Israelites a month old or more, and list their names.
<span class="reftext">41</span>You are to take the Levites for Me—I am the LORD—in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>So Moses numbered all the firstborn of the Israelites, as the LORD had commanded him.
<span class="reftext">43</span>The total number of the firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,
<span class="reftext">45</span>“Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites belong to Me; I am the LORD.
<span class="reftext">46</span>To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who outnumber the Levites,
<span class="reftext">47</span>you are to collect five shekels<span class="fn">e</span>  for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel of twenty gerahs.<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">48</span>Give the money to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for the excess among the Israelites.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">49</span>So Moses collected the redemption money from those in excess of the number redeemed by the Levites.
<span class="reftext">50</span>He collected the money from the firstborn of the Israelites: 1,365 shekels,<span class="fn">g</span>  according to the sanctuary shekel.
<span class="reftext">51</span>And Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons in obedience to the word of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">strange</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Most MT manuscripts; some MT manuscripts, SP, and LXX (see also Numbers 8:16) <i class="calibre6">to Me</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew; some LXX manuscripts <i class="calibre6">8,300</i>; see the total in verse 39.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Elizaphan</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Elzaphan</i>; see Exodus 6:22 and Leviticus 10:4.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">47</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">5 shekels</i> is approximately 2 ounces or 57 grams.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">47</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">20 gerahs</i> is equivalent to one shekel (approximately 0.4 ounces or 11.4 grams).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">50</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">1,365 shekels</i> is approximately 34.3 pounds or 15.6 kilograms.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
