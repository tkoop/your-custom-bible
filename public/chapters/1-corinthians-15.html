Corinthians 15</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Resurrection</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the
gospel I preached to you, which you received, and in which you stand
firm. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I
preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For what I received I passed on to you as
of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the
Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day
according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared to Cephas and then
to the Twelve. After that, He appeared to more than five hundred
brothers at once, most of whom are still living, though some have
fallen asleep. Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
And last of all He appeared to me also, as to one of untimely birth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For I am the least of the apostles and am
unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of
God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace to me was
not in vain. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but
the grace of God that was with me. Whether, then, it was I or they,
this is what we preach, and this is what you believed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But if it is preached that Christ has been
raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no
resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of the dead,
then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been
raised, our preaching is worthless, and so is your faith. In that
case, we are also exposed as false witnesses about God. For we have
testified about God that He raised Christ from the dead, but He did
not raise Him if in fact the dead are not raised. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For if the dead are not raised, then not
even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your
faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have
fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If our hope in Christ is for
this life alone, we are to be pitied more than all men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Christ has indeed been raised from the
dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since
death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also
through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made
alive. But each in his own turn: Christ the firstfruits; then at His
coming, those who belong to Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the end will come, when He hands over
the kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed all dominion,
authority, and power. For He must reign until He has put all His
enemies under His feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death. For
“God has put everything under His feet.” Now when it says that
everything has been put under Him, this clearly does not include the
One who put everything under Him. And when all things have been
subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will be made subject to Him
who put all things under Him, so that God may be all in all. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If these things are not so, what will
those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at
all, why are people baptized for them? And why do we endanger
ourselves every hour? I face death every day, brothers, as surely as
I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord. If I fought wild beasts
in Ephesus for human motives, what did I gain? If the dead are not
raised, </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not be deceived: “Bad company
corrupts good character.” Sober up as you ought, and stop sinning;
for some of you are ignorant of God. I say this to your shame. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But someone will ask, “How are the dead
raised? With what kind of body will they come?” You fool! What you
sow does not come to life unless it dies. And what you sow is not the
body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or something
else. But God gives it a body as He has designed, and to each kind of
seed He gives its own body. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Not all flesh is the same: Men have one
kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another, and fish another.
There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the splendor
of the heavenly bodies is of one degree, and the splendor of the
earthly bodies is of another. The sun has one degree of splendor, the
moon another, and the stars another; and star differs from star in
splendor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So will it be with the resurrection of the
dead: What is sown is perishable; it is raised imperishable. It is
sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it
is raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a
spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual
body. So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being;”
the last Adam a life-giving spirit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The spiritual, however, was not first, but
the natural, and then the spiritual. The first man was of the dust of
the earth, the second man from heaven. As was the earthly man, so
also are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so
also are those who are of heaven. And just as we have borne the
likeness of the earthly man, so also shall we bear the likeness of
the heavenly man. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now I declare to you, brothers, that flesh
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable
inherit the imperishable. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not
all sleep, but we will all be changed— in an instant, in the
twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound,
the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. For the
perishable must be clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with
immortality. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the perishable has been clothed with
the imperishable and the mortal with immortality, then the saying
that is written will come to pass: “Death has been swallowed up in
victory.” </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Where, O Death, is your victory? </font>

of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ! </font>
