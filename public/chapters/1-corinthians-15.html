<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Resurrection of Christ</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now, brothers, I want to remind <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> of the gospel I preached to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> received, and in which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> stand firm.
<span class="reftext">2</span>By this gospel <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are saved, if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> hold firmly to the word I preached to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. Otherwise, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have believed in vain.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For what I received I passed on to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the <span class='cap'>Scriptures</span><span class='nocap'>scriptures</span><span class='bsb'>Scriptures</span>,
<span class="reftext">4</span>that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was buried, that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was raised on the third day according to the <span class='cap'>Scriptures</span><span class='nocap'>scriptures</span><span class='bsb'>Scriptures</span>,
<span class="reftext">5</span>and that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> appeared to Cephas<span class="fn">a</span>  and then to the <span class='cap'>Twelve</span><span class='nocap'>twelve</span><span class='bsb'>Twelve</span>.
<span class="reftext">6</span>After that, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And last of all <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> appeared to me also, as to one of untimely birth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>For I am the least of the apostles and am unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> grace to me was not in vain. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> believed.
</p><p class="hdg">The Resurrection of the Dead</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
<span class="reftext">13</span>If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is worthless, and so is <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faith.
<span class="reftext">15</span>In that case, we are also exposed as false witnesses about God. For we have testified about God that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> raised Christ from the dead, but <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> did not raise <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> if in fact the dead are not raised.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And if Christ has not been raised, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faith is futile; <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are still in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sins.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
<span class="reftext">19</span>If our hope in Christ is for this life alone, we are to be pitied more than all men.
</p><p class="hdg">The Order of Resurrection</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
<span class="reftext">21</span>For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
<span class="reftext">22</span>For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
<span class="reftext">23</span>But each in his own turn: Christ the firstfruits; then at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> coming, those who belong to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then the end will come, when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> hands over the kingdom to God the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> after <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has destroyed all dominion, authority, and power.
<span class="reftext">25</span>For <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> must reign until <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has put all <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> enemies under <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> feet.
<span class="reftext">26</span>The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
<span class="reftext">27</span>For “God has put everything under <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> feet.”<span class="fn">b</span>  Now when it says that everything has been put under <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, this clearly does not include the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> who put everything under <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span class="reftext">28</span>And when all things have been subjected to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, then the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span><span class='bsb'>Himself</span> will be made subject to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> who put all things under <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, so that God may be all in all.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>If these things are not so, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?
<span class="reftext">30</span>And why do we endanger ourselves every hour?
<span class="reftext">31</span>I face death every day, brothers, as surely as I boast about <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in Christ Jesus our Lord.
<span class="reftext">32</span>If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for human motives, what did I gain? If the dead are not raised, </p><p class="indent1stline">“Let us eat and drink, </p><p class="indent"> for tomorrow we die.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good character.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Sober up as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> ought, and stop sinning; for some of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are ignorant of God. I say this to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> shame.
</p><p class="hdg">The Resurrection Body</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?”
<span class="reftext">36</span>You fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
<span class="reftext">37</span>And what you sow is not the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or something else.
<span class="reftext">38</span>But God gives it a body as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has designed, and to each kind of seed <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> gives its own body.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Not all flesh is the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another, and fish another.
<span class="reftext">40</span>There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the <span class='spell ca'>splendour</span><span class='spell gb'>splendour</span><span class='spell us'>splendor</span> of the heavenly bodies is of one degree, and the <span class='spell ca'>splendour</span><span class='spell gb'>splendour</span><span class='spell us'>splendor</span> of the earthly bodies is of another.
<span class="reftext">41</span>The sun has one degree of <span class='spell ca'>splendour</span><span class='spell gb'>splendour</span><span class='spell us'>splendor</span>, the moon another, and the stars another; and star differs from star in <span class='spell ca'>splendour</span><span class='spell gb'>splendour</span><span class='spell us'>splendor</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>So will it be with the resurrection of the dead: What is sown is perishable; it is raised imperishable.
<span class="reftext">43</span>It is sown in <span class='spell ca'>dishonour</span><span class='spell gb'>dishonour</span><span class='spell us'>dishonor</span>; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
<span class="reftext">44</span>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
<span class="reftext">45</span>So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being;”<span class="fn">e</span>  the last Adam a life-giving spirit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>The spiritual, however, was not first, but the natural, and then the spiritual.
<span class="reftext">47</span>The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>.
<span class="reftext">48</span>As was the earthly man, so also are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>.
<span class="reftext">49</span>And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so also shall we bear the likeness of the heavenly man.
</p><p class="hdg">Where, O Death, Is Your Victory?<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Hosea 13:9–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>Now I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">51</span>Listen, I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—
<span class="reftext">52</span>in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
<span class="reftext">53</span>For the perishable must be clothed<span class="fn">f</span>  with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">54</span>When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable and the mortal with immortality,<span class="fn">g</span>  then the saying that is written will come to pass: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”<span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">55</span>“Where, O Death, is your victory? </p><p class="indent"> Where, O Death, is your sting?”<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">56</span>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
<span class="reftext">57</span>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">58</span>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast and immovable.
