<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Resurrection of Christ</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, and in which you stand firm.
<span class="reftext">2</span>By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
<span class="reftext">4</span>that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
<span class="reftext">5</span>and that He appeared to Cephas<span class="fn">a</span>  and then to the Twelve.
<span class="reftext">6</span>After that, He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And last of all He appeared to me also, as to one of untimely birth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>For I am the least of the apostles and am unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace to me was not in vain. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.
</p><p class="hdg">The Resurrection of the Dead</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
<span class="reftext">13</span>If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is worthless, and so is your faith.
<span class="reftext">15</span>In that case, we are also exposed as false witnesses about God. For we have testified about God that He raised Christ from the dead, but He did not raise Him if in fact the dead are not raised.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
<span class="reftext">19</span>If our hope in Christ is for this life alone, we are to be pitied more than all men.
</p><p class="hdg">The Order of Resurrection</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
<span class="reftext">21</span>For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
<span class="reftext">22</span>For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
<span class="reftext">23</span>But each in his own turn: Christ the firstfruits; then at His coming, those who belong to Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then the end will come, when He hands over the kingdom to God the Father after He has destroyed all dominion, authority, and power.
<span class="reftext">25</span>For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.
<span class="reftext">26</span>The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
<span class="reftext">27</span>For “God has put everything under His feet.”<span class="fn">b</span>  Now when it says that everything has been put under Him, this clearly does not include the One who put everything under Him.
<span class="reftext">28</span>And when all things have been subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will be made subject to Him who put all things under Him, so that God may be all in all.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>If these things are not so, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?
<span class="reftext">30</span>And why do we endanger ourselves every hour?
<span class="reftext">31</span>I face death every day, brothers, as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord.
<span class="reftext">32</span>If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for human motives, what did I gain? If the dead are not raised, </p><p class="indent1stline">“Let us eat and drink, </p><p class="indent"> for tomorrow we die.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good character.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Sober up as you ought, and stop sinning; for some of you are ignorant of God. I say this to your shame.
</p><p class="hdg">The Resurrection Body</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?”
<span class="reftext">36</span>You fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
<span class="reftext">37</span>And what you sow is not the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or something else.
<span class="reftext">38</span>But God gives it a body as He has designed, and to each kind of seed He gives its own body.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Not all flesh is the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another, and fish another.
<span class="reftext">40</span>There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the splendour of the heavenly bodies is of one degree, and the splendour of the earthly bodies is of another.
<span class="reftext">41</span>The sun has one degree of splendour, the moon another, and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendour.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>So will it be with the resurrection of the dead: What is sown is perishable; it is raised imperishable.
<span class="reftext">43</span>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
<span class="reftext">44</span>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
<span class="reftext">45</span>So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being;”<span class="fn">e</span>  the last Adam a life-giving spirit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>The spiritual, however, was not first, but the natural, and then the spiritual.
<span class="reftext">47</span>The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven.
<span class="reftext">48</span>As was the earthly man, so also are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven.
<span class="reftext">49</span>And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so also shall we bear the likeness of the heavenly man.
</p><p class="hdg">Where, O Death, Is Your Victory?<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Hosea 13:9–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>Now I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">51</span>Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—
<span class="reftext">52</span>in an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
<span class="reftext">53</span>For the perishable must be clothed<span class="fn">f</span>  with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">54</span>When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable and the mortal with immortality,<span class="fn">g</span>  then the saying that is written will come to pass: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”<span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">55</span>“Where, O Death, is your victory? </p><p class="indent"> Where, O Death, is your sting?”<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">56</span>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
<span class="reftext">57</span>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">58</span>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast and immovable. Always excel in the work of the Lord, because you know that your labour in the Lord is not in vain.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, Peter<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Psalm 8:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">32</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Isaiah 22:13<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Probably a quote from the Greek comedy <i class="calibre6">Thais</i> by Menander<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">45</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Genesis 2:7<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">53</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">clothe itself</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">54</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> WH does not include <i class="calibre6">and the mortal with immortality</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">54</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Isaiah 25:8<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">55</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Hosea 13:14 (see also LXX); BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">“Where, O Death, is your sting?
