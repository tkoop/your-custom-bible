<font ><b>Amaziah, Jehoash, Jeroboam, Azariah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the second year of the reign of Jehoash
son of Jehoahaz over Israel, Amaziah son of Joash became king of
Judah. He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he
reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was
Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem. And he did what was right in the
eyes of the LORD, but not as his father David had done. He did
everything as his father Joash had done. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, the high places were not
taken away, and the people continued sacrificing and burning incense
on the high places. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his
grasp, Amaziah executed the servants who had murdered his father the
king. Yet he did not put the sons of the murderers to death, but
acted according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses,
where the LORD commanded: “Fathers must not be put to death for
their children, and children must not be put to death for their
fathers; each is to die for his own sin.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Amaziah struck down 10,000 Edomites in the
Valley of Salt. He took Sela in battle and called it Joktheel, which
is its name to this very day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Amaziah sent messengers to the king
of Israel Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu. “Come, let us
meet face to face,” he said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jehoash king of Israel replied to
Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a
cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in
marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the
thistle. You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has become
proud. Glory in that and stay at home. Why should you stir up trouble
so that you fall—you and Judah with you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Amaziah would not listen, and Jehoash
king of Israel advanced. He and King Amaziah of Judah faced each
other at Beth-shemesh in Judah. And Judah was routed before Israel,
and every man fled to his home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There at Beth-shemesh, Jehoash king of
Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of
Ahaziah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem and broke
down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a
section of four hundred cubits. He took all the gold and silver and
all the articles found in the house of the LORD and in the treasuries
of the royal palace, as well as some hostages. Then he returned to
Samaria. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Jehoash,
along with his accomplishments, his might, and how he waged war
against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of
the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehoash rested with his fathers and
was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And his son Jeroboam
reigned in his place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived
for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of
Israel. As for the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written
in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And conspirators plotted against Amaziah
in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But men were sent after him to
Lachish, and they killed him there. They carried him back on horses
and buried him in Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then all the people of Judah took Azariah,
who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father
Amaziah. Azariah was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to
Judah after King Amaziah rested with his fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the fifteenth year of the reign of
Amaziah son of Joash over Judah, Jeroboam son of Jehoash became king
of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria forty-one years. And he did evil
in the sight of the LORD and did not turn away from all the sins that
Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This Jeroboam restored the boundary of
Israel from Lebo-hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, according to the
word that the LORD, the God of Israel, had spoken through His servant
Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath-hepher. For the LORD saw
that the affliction of the Israelites, both slave and free, was very
bitter. There was no one to help Israel, and since the LORD had said
that He would not blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, He
saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Jeroboam,
along with all his accomplishments and might, and how he waged war
and recovered both Damascus and Hamath for Israel from Judah, are
they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of
Israel? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the
kings of Israel. And his son Zechariah reigned in his place. </font>
