<span class="reftext">2</span>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he did what was right in the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, but not as his father David had done. He did everything as his father Joash had done.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Nevertheless, the high places were not taken away, and the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, Amaziah executed the servants who had murdered his father the king.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Yet he did not put the sons of the murderers to death, but acted according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, where <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> commanded: “Fathers must not be put to death for their children, and children must not be put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Amaziah struck down 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. He took Sela in battle and called it Joktheel, which is its name to this very day.
</p><p class="hdg">Jehoash Defeats Amaziah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 25:17–24)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Amaziah sent messengers to the king of Israel Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu. “Come, let us meet face to face,” he said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle.
<span class="reftext">10</span>You have indeed defeated Edom, and your heart has become proud. Glory in that and stay at home. Why should you stir up trouble so that you fall—you and Judah with you?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But Amaziah would not listen, and Jehoash king of Israel advanced. He and King Amaziah of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh in Judah.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And Judah was routed before Israel, and every man fled to his home.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>There at Beth-shemesh, Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah. </p><p class="reg1"> Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section of four hundred cubits.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">14</span>He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and in the treasuries of the royal palace, as well as some hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And Jehoash rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And his son Jeroboam reigned in his place.
</p><p class="hdg">The Death of Amaziah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 25:25–28)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
<span class="reftext">18</span>As for the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And conspirators plotted against Amaziah in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But men were sent after him to Lachish, and they killed him there.
<span class="reftext">20</span>They carried him back on horses and buried him in Jerusalem with his fathers in the City of David.
</p><p class="hdg">Azariah Succeeds Amaziah in Judah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 26:1–2)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then all the people of Judah took Azariah,<span class="fn">d</span>  who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Azariah was the one who rebuilt Elath<span class="fn">e</span>  and restored it to Judah after King Amaziah rested with his fathers.

<span class="reftext">24</span>And he did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and did not turn away from all the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>This Jeroboam restored the boundary of Israel from Lebo-hamath to the Sea of the Arabah,<span class="fn">f</span>  according to the word that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, had spoken through His servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath-hepher.
<span class="reftext">26</span>For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> saw that the affliction of the Israelites, both slave and free, was very bitter. There was no one to help Israel,
<span class="reftext">27</span>and since <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had said that He would not blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash.
