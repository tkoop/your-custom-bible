12</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The First Passover</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron in
the land of Egypt, “This month is the beginning of months for you;
it shall be the first month of your year. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Tell the whole congregation of Israel that
on the tenth day of this month each man must select a lamb for his
family, one per household. If the household is too small for a whole
lamb, they are to share with the nearest neighbor based on the number
of people, and apportion the lamb accordingly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Your lamb must be an unblemished year-old
male, and you may take it from the sheep or the goats. You must keep
it until the fourteenth day of the month, when the whole assembly of
the congregation of Israel will slaughter the animals at twilight.
They are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops
of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They are to eat the meat that night,
roasted over the fire, along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not eat any of the meat raw or cooked
in boiling water, but only roasted over the fire—its head and legs
and inner parts. Do not leave any of it until morning; before the
morning you must burn up any part that is left over. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is how you are to eat it: You must be
fully dressed for travel, with your sandals on your feet and your
staff in your hand. You are to eat in haste; it is the LORD’s
Passover. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On that night I will pass through the land
of Egypt and strike down every firstborn male, both man and beast,
and I will execute judgment against all the gods of Egypt. I am the
LORD. The blood on the houses where you are staying will distinguish
them; when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No plague will fall
on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And this day will be a memorial for you,
and you are to celebrate it as a feast to the LORD, as a permanent
statute for the generations to come. For seven days you must eat
unleavened bread. On the first day you are to remove the leaven from
your houses. Whoever eats anything leavened from the first day
through the seventh must be cut off from Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the first day you are to hold a sacred
assembly, and another on the seventh day. You must not do any work on
those days, except to prepare the meals—that is all you may do. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So you are to keep the Feast of Unleavened
Bread, for on this very day I brought your divisions out of the land
of Egypt. You must keep this day as a permanent statute for the
generations to come. In the first month you are to eat unleavened
bread, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of
the twenty-first day. For seven days there must be no leaven found in
your houses. If anyone eats something leavened, that person, whether
a foreigner or native of the land, must be cut off from the
congregation of Israel. You are not to eat anything leavened; eat
unleavened bread in all your homes.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Moses summoned all the elders of
Israel and told them, “Go at once and select for yourselves a lamb
for each family, and slaughter the Passover lamb. Take a cluster of
hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin, and brush the blood on
the top and sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out the door
of his house until morning. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the LORD passes through to strike
down the Egyptians, He will see the blood on the top and sides of the
doorframe and will pass over that doorway; so He will not allow the
destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And you are to keep this command as a
permanent statute for you and your descendants. When you enter the
land that the LORD will give you as He promised, you are to keep this
service. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When your children ask you, ‘What does
this service mean to you?’ you are to reply, ‘It is the Passover
sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites
in Egypt when He struck down the Egyptians and spared our homes.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the people bowed down and worshiped.
And the Israelites went and did just what the LORD had commanded
Moses and Aaron. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now at midnight the LORD struck down every
firstborn male in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh,
who sat on his throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner in the
dungeon, as well as all the firstborn among the livestock. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">During the night Pharaoh got up—he and
all his officials and all the Egyptians—and there was loud wailing
in Egypt; for there was no house without someone dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron by
night and said, “Get up, leave my people, both you and the
Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested. Take your
flocks and herds as well, just as you have said, and depart! And
bless me also.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And in order to send them out of the land
quickly, the Egyptians urged the people on. “For otherwise,” they
said, “we are all going to die!” So the people took their dough
before it was leavened, carrying it on their shoulders in kneading
bowls wrapped in clothing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Furthermore, the Israelites acted on
Moses’ word and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and
gold, and for clothing. And the LORD gave the people such favor in
the sight of the Egyptians that they granted their request. In this
way they plundered the Egyptians. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to
Succoth with about 600,000 men on foot, besides women and children.
And a mixed multitude also went up with them, along with great droves
of livestock, both flocks and herds. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Since their dough had no leaven, the
people baked what they had brought out of Egypt into unleavened
loaves. For when they had been driven out of Egypt, they could not
delay and had not prepared any provisions for themselves. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the duration of the Israelites’ stay
in Egypt was 430 years. At the end of the 430 years, to the very day,
all the LORD’s divisions went out of the land of Egypt. Because the
LORD kept a vigil that night to bring them out of the land of Egypt,
this same night is to be a vigil to the LORD, to be observed by all
the Israelites for the generations to come. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
“This is the statute of the Passover: No foreigner is to eat of it.
But any slave who has been purchased may eat of it, after you have
circumcised him. A temporary resident or hired hand shall not eat the
Passover. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">It must be eaten inside one house. You are
not to take any of the meat outside the house, and you may not break
any of the bones. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The whole congregation of Israel must
celebrate it. If a foreigner resides with you and wants to celebrate
the LORD’s Passover, all the males in the household must be
circumcised; then he may come near to celebrate it, and he shall be
like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised man may eat of it.
The same law shall apply to both the native and the foreigner who
resides among you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all the Israelites did this—they
did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. And on that very
day the LORD brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their
divisions. </font>
