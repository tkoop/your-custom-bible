<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">One Sabbath Jesus was passing through the
grainfields, and His disciples began to pick the heads of grain, rub
them in their hands, and eat them. But some of the Pharisees asked,
“Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Have
you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God, took the consecrated bread and gave it
to his companions, and ate what is lawful only for the priests to
eat.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus declared, <font color="#a80000">“The
Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On another Sabbath Jesus entered the
synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was
withered. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, the scribes and
Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He would heal on the
Sabbath. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to
the man with the withered hand, <font color="#a80000">“Get up and
stand among us.”</font> So he got up and stood there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“I
ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to
save life or to destroy it?”</font> And after looking around at all
of them, He said to the man, <font color="#a80000">“Stretch out
your hand.”</font> He did so, and it was restored. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the scribes and Pharisees were filled
with rage and began to discuss with one another what they might do to
Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In those days Jesus went out to the
mountain to pray, and He spent the night in prayer to God. When
daylight came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of
them, whom He also designated as apostles: Simon, whom He named
Peter, and his brother Andrew; James and John; Philip and
Bartholomew; Matthew and Thomas; James son of Alphaeus and Simon
called the Zealot; Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became
a traitor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus came down with them and stood
on a level place. A large crowd of His disciples was there, along
with a great number of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the
sea coast of Tyre and Sidon. They had come to hear Him and to be
healed of their diseases, and those troubled by unclean spirits were
healed. The entire crowd was trying to touch Him, because power was
coming from Him and healing them all. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Looking up at His disciples, Jesus said: </font>

who will listen, I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate
you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If
someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. And if
someone takes your cloak, do not withhold your tunic as well. Give to
everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what is yours, do not
demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you. </font></font>

lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full. </font></font>

use, it will be measured back to you.” </font></font>

you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye. </font></font>

bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. For each tree is
known by its own fruit. Indeed, figs are not gathered from

evil things out of the evil treasure of his heart. For out of the
overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks. </font></font>
