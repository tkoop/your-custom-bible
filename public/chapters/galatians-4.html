<font ><b>Sons and Heirs</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >What I am saying is that as long as the
heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he is the
owner of everything. He is subject to guardians and trustees until
the date set by his father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So also, when we were children, we were
enslaved under the basic principles of the world. But when the time
had fully come, God sent His Son, born of a woman, born under the
law, to redeem those under the law, that we might receive our
adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of
His Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!” So you are
no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, you are also
an heir through God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Formerly, when you did not know God, you
were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. But now that you
know God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you are turning
back to those weak and worthless principles? Do you wish to be
enslaved by them all over again? You are observing special days and
months and seasons and years! I fear for you, that my efforts for you
may have been in vain. I beg you, brothers, become like me, for I
became like you. You have done me no wrong. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You know that it was because of an illness
that I first preached the gospel to you. And although my illness was
a trial to you, you did not despise or reject me. Instead, you
welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus
Himself. What then has become of your blessing? For I can testify
that, if it were possible, you would have torn out your eyes and
given them to me. Have I now become your enemy by telling you the
truth? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Those people are zealous for you, but not
in a good way. Instead, they want to isolate you from us, so that you
may be zealous for them. Nevertheless, it is good to be zealous if it
serves a noble purpose—at any time, and not only when I am with
you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >My children, for whom I am again in the
pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, how I wish I could
be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Tell me, you who want to be under the law,
do you not understand what the law says? For it is written that
Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the
free woman. His son by the slave woman was born according to the
flesh, but his son by the free woman was born through the promise. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These things serve as illustrations, for
the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai
and bears children into slavery: This is Hagar. Now Hagar stands for
Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present-day Jerusalem,
because she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above
is free, and she is our mother. For it is written: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Rejoice, O barren woman, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >who bears no children; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >break forth and cry aloud, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >you who have never travailed; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >because more are the children of the
desolate woman </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >than of her who has a husband.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are
children of promise. At that time, however, the son born by the flesh
persecuted the son born by the Spirit. It is the same now. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But what does the Scripture say? “Expel
the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never
share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.” Therefore,
brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free
woman. </font>
