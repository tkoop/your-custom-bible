<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Sons and Heirs</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he is the owner of everything.
<span class="reftext">2</span>He is subject to guardians and trustees until the date set by his father.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So also, when we were children, we were enslaved under the basic principles<span class="fn">a</span>  of the world.
<span class="reftext">4</span>But when the time had fully come, God sent <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
<span class="reftext">5</span>to redeem those under the law, that we might receive our adoption as sons.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And because you are sons, God sent the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> Son into our hearts, crying out, “Abba, <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>!”
<span class="reftext">7</span>So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, you are also an heir through God.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Concern for the Galatians</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.
<span class="reftext">9</span>But now that you know God, or rather are known by God, how is it that you are turning back to those weak and worthless principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?
<span class="reftext">10</span>You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!
<span class="reftext">11</span>I fear for you, that my efforts for you may have been in vain.
<span class="reftext">12</span>I beg you, brothers, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>You know that it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And although my illness was a trial to you, you did not despise or reject me. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span>.
<span class="reftext">15</span>What then has become of your blessing? For I can testify that, if it were possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Those people are zealous for you, but not in a good way. Instead, they want to isolate you from us, so that you may be zealous for them.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Nevertheless, it is good to be zealous if it serves a noble purpose—at any time, and not only when I am with you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>My children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,
<span class="reftext">20</span>how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.
</p><p class="hdg">Hagar and Sarah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Genesis 21:9–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not understand what the law says?
<span class="reftext">22</span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">23</span>His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born through the promise.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>These things serve as illustrations, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children into slavery: This is Hagar.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present-day Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.
<span class="reftext">26</span>But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
<span class="reftext">27</span>For it is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Rejoice, O barren woman, </p><p class="indent"> who bears no children; </p><p class="indent1"> break forth and cry aloud, </p><p class="indent"> you who have never travailed; </p><p class="indent1"> because more are the children of the desolate woman </p><p class="indent"> than of her who has a husband.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Now you,<span class="fn">d</span>  brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
<span class="reftext">29</span>At that time, however, the son born by the flesh persecuted the son born by the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>. It is the same now.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>But what does the <span class='cap'>Scripture</span><span class='nocap'>scripture</span> say? “Expel the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">elemental forces</i>; similarly in verse 9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> See Genesis 16:15 and Genesis 21:2–3.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Isaiah 54:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> WH, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">we</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Genesis 21:10<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
