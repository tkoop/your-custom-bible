trumpets of hammered silver to be used for calling the congregation
and for having the camps set out. When both are sounded, the whole
congregation is to assemble before you at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting. But if only one is sounded, then the leaders, the heads of
the clans of Israel, are to gather before you. </font>

that lie on the east side are to set out. When you sound the short
blasts a second time, the camps that lie on the south side are to set
out. The blasts are to signal them to set out. To convene the
assembly, you are to sound long blasts, not short ones. The sons of
Aaron, the priests, are to sound the trumpets. This shall be a
permanent statute for you and the generations to come. </font>

over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to serve as a
reminder for you before your God. I am the LORD your God.” </font>
