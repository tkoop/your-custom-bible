<span class="reftext">2</span>“Make two trumpets of hammered silver to be used for calling the congregation and for having the camps set out.
<span class="reftext">3</span>When both are sounded, the whole congregation is to assemble before you at the entrance to the <span class='cap'>Tent</span><span class='nocap'>tent</span> of <span class='cap'>Meeting</span><span class='nocap'>meeting</span>.
<span class="reftext">4</span>But if only one is sounded, then the leaders, the heads of the clans of Israel, are to gather before you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> sound short blasts, the camps that lie on the east side are to set out.
<span class="reftext">6</span>When <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> sound the short blasts a second time, the camps that lie on the south side are to set out. The blasts are to signal them to set out.
<span class="reftext">7</span>To convene the assembly, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are to sound long blasts, not short ones.
<span class="reftext">8</span>The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to sound the trumpets. This shall be a permanent statute for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and the generations to come.

<span class="reftext">10</span>And on your joyous occasions, <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> appointed feasts, and the beginning of each month, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are to blow the trumpets over <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to serve as a reminder for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> before <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God.

</p><p class="hdg">From Sinai to Paran</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud was lifted from above the tabernacle of the <span class='cap'>Testimony</span><span class='nocap'>testimony</span>,
<span class="reftext">12</span>and the Israelites set out from the <span class='cap'>Wilderness</span><span class='nocap'>wilderness</span> of Sinai, <span class='spell ca'>travelling</span><span class='spell gb'>travelling</span><span class='spell us'>traveling</span> from place to place until the cloud settled in the <span class='cap'>Wilderness</span><span class='nocap'>wilderness</span> of Paran.
<span class="reftext">13</span>They set out this first time according to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s command through Moses.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>First, the divisions of the camp of Judah set out under their standard, with Nahshon son of Amminadab in command.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar,
<span class="reftext">16</span>and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and the Merarites set out, transporting it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then the divisions of the camp of Reuben set out under their standard, with Elizur son of Shedeur in command.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon,
<span class="reftext">20</span>and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Then the Kohathites set out, transporting the holy objects; the tabernacle was to be set up before their arrival.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Next, the divisions of the camp of Ephraim set out under their standard, with Elishama son of Ammihud in command.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,
<span class="reftext">24</span>and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Finally, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard, serving as the rear guard for all units, with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai in command.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,
<span class="reftext">27</span>and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Then Moses said to Hobab, the son of Moses’ father-in-law Reuel<span class="fn">a</span>  the Midianite, “We are setting out for the place of which <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said: ‘I will give it to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.’ Come with us, and we will treat <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> well, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has promised good things to Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>“I will not go,” Hobab replied. “Instead, I am going back to my own land and my own people.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>“Please do not leave us,” Moses said, “since you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our eyes.
<span class="reftext">32</span>If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> gives us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>So they set out on a three-day journey from the mountain of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, with the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='spell ca'>travelling</span><span class='spell gb'>travelling</span><span class='spell us'>traveling</span> ahead of them for those three days to seek a resting place for them.
<span class="reftext">34</span>And the cloud of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say, </p><p class="indent1stline">“Rise up, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>! </p><p class="indent"> May <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> enemies be scattered; </p><p class="indent"> may those who hate <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> flee before <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>And when it came to rest, he would say: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Return, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, </p><p class="indent"> to the countless thousands of Israel.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">29</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Reuel</i> was also called <i class="calibre6">Jethro</i>; see Exodus 3:1.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
