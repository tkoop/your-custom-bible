<font ><b>The Two Silver Trumpets</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make two
trumpets of hammered silver to be used for calling the congregation
and for having the camps set out. When both are sounded, the whole
congregation is to assemble before you at the entrance to the Tent of
Meeting. But if only one is sounded, then the leaders, the heads of
the clans of Israel, are to gather before you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When you sound short blasts, the camps
that lie on the east side are to set out. When you sound the short
blasts a second time, the camps that lie on the south side are to set
out. The blasts are to signal them to set out. To convene the
assembly, you are to sound long blasts, not short ones. The sons of
Aaron, the priests, are to sound the trumpets. This shall be a
permanent statute for you and the generations to come. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When you enter into battle in your land
against an adversary who attacks you, sound short blasts on the
trumpets, and you will be remembered before the LORD your God and
saved from your enemies. And on your joyous occasions, your appointed
feasts, and the beginning of each month, you are to blow the trumpets
over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to serve as a
reminder for you before your God. I am the LORD your God.” </font>
</p>

<font >On the twentieth day of the second month
of the second year, the cloud was lifted from above the tabernacle of
the Testimony, and the Israelites set out from the Wilderness of
Sinai, traveling from place to place until the cloud settled in the
Wilderness of Paran. They set out this first time according to the
LORD’s command through Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >First, the divisions of the camp of Judah
set out under their standard, with Nahshon son of Amminadab in
command. Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of
Issachar, and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe
of Zebulun. Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites
and the Merarites set out, transporting it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the divisions of the camp of Reuben
set out under their standard, with Elizur son of Shedeur in command.
Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of
Simeon, and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe
of Gad. Then the Kohathites set out, transporting the holy objects;
the tabernacle was to be set up before their arrival. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next, the divisions of the camp of Ephraim
set out under their standard, with Elishama son of Ammihud in
command. Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe
of Manasseh, and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the
tribe of Benjamin. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Finally, the divisions of the camp of Dan
set out under their standard, serving as the rear guard for all
units, with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai in command. Pagiel son of
Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher, and Ahira son of
Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This was the order of march for the
Israelite divisions as they set out. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses said to Hobab, the son of
Moses’ father-in-law Reuel the Midianite, “We are setting out for
the place of which the LORD said: ‘I will give it to you.’ Come
with us, and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good
things to Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I will not go,” Hobab replied.
“Instead, I am going back to my own land and my own people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Please do not leave us,” Moses said,
“since you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can
serve as our eyes. If you come with us, we will share with you
whatever good things the LORD gives us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they set out on a three-day journey
from the mountain of the LORD, with the ark of the covenant of the
LORD traveling ahead of them for those three days to seek a resting
place for them. And the cloud of the LORD was over them by day when
they set out from the camp. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say,
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Rise up, O LORD! </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >May Your enemies be scattered; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >may those who hate You flee before You.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when it came to rest, he would say: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Return, O LORD, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >to the countless thousands of Israel.” </font>
