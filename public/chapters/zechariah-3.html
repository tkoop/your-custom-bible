<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Vision of Joshua the High Priest</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the angel showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel<span class="fn">a</span>  of the LORD, with Satan<span class="fn">b</span>  standing at his right hand to accuse him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And the LORD said to Satan: “The LORD rebukes you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you! Is not this man a firebrand<span class="fn">c</span>  snatched from the fire?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Now Joshua was dressed in filthy garments as he stood before the angel.
<span class="reftext">4</span>So the angel said to those standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes!” </p><p class="reg1"> Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have removed your iniquity, and I will clothe you with splendid robes.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So a clean turban was placed on his head, and they clothed him, as the angel of the LORD stood by.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then the angel of the LORD gave this charge to Joshua:
<span class="reftext">7</span>“This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘If you walk in My ways and keep My instructions, then you will govern My house and will also have charge of My courts; and I will give you a place among these who are standing here.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Hear now, O high priest Joshua, you and your companions seated before you, who are indeed a sign. For behold, I am going to bring My servant, the Branch.
<span class="reftext">9</span>See the stone I have set before Joshua; on that one stone are seven eyes.<span class="fn">d</span>  Behold, I will engrave on it an inscription, declares the LORD of Hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.
<span class="reftext">10</span>On that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, you will each invite your neighbour to sit under your own vine and fig tree.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i>; also in verses 3, 4, 5, and 6; corresponding pronouns may also be capitalized.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, <i class="calibre6">the Accuser</i> or <i class="calibre6">the Adversary</i>; also in verse 2<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, <i class="calibre6">a burning stick</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">facets</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
