<font ><b>The Vision of Joshua the High Priest</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the angel showed me Joshua the high
priest standing before the angel of the LORD, with Satan standing at
his right hand to accuse him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Satan: “The LORD
rebukes you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD, who has chosen Jerusalem,
rebukes you! Is not this man a firebrand snatched from the fire?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Joshua was dressed in filthy garments
as he stood before the angel. So the angel said to those standing
before him, “Take off his filthy clothes!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have
removed your iniquity, and I will clothe you with splendid robes.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I said, “Let them put a clean
turban on his head.” So a clean turban was placed on his head, and
they clothed him, as the angel of the LORD stood by. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the angel of the LORD gave this
charge to Joshua: “This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘If you
walk in My ways and keep My instructions, then you will govern My
house and will also have charge of My courts; and I will give you a
place among these who are standing here. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Hear now, O high priest Joshua, you and
your companions seated before you, who are indeed a sign. For behold,
I am going to bring My servant, the Branch. See the stone I have set
before Joshua; on that one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will
engrave on it an inscription, declares the LORD of Hosts, and I will
remove the iniquity of this land in a single day. On that day,
declares the LORD of Hosts, you will each invite your neighbor to sit
under your own vine and fig tree.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
