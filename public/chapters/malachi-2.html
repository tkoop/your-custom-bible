</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>If you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name,” says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, “I will send a curse among you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have already begun to curse them, because you are not taking it to heart.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Behold, I will rebuke your descendants,<span class="fn">a</span>  and I will spread dung on your faces, the waste from your feasts, and you will be carried off with it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then you will know that I have sent you this commandment so that <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> covenant with Levi may continue,” says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
<span class="reftext">5</span>“My covenant with him was one of life and peace, which I gave to him; it called for reverence, and he revered <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and stood in awe of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>True instruction was in his mouth, and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, because he is the messenger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But you have departed from the way, and your instruction has caused many to stumble. You have violated the covenant of Levi,” says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
<span class="reftext">9</span>“So I in turn have made you despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not kept <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ways, but have shown partiality in matters of the law.”
</p><p class="hdg">Judah’s Unfaithfulness</p><p class="indent1stline"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Do we not all have one <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>? Did not one God create us? Why then do we break faith with one another so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Judah has broken faith; an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s beloved sanctuary by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.
<span class="reftext">12</span>As for the man who does this, may <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> cut off from the tents of Jacob everyone who is awake and aware—even if he brings an offering to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And this is another thing you do: You cover the altar of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> with tears, with weeping and groaning, because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> no longer regards your offerings or receives them gladly from your hands.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Yet you ask, “Why?” </p><p class="reg1"> It is because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have broken faith, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Has not <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> made them one, having a portion of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>? And why one? Because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> seeks godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit and do not break faith with the wife of your youth.
</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>“For I hate divorce,” says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel. “He who divorces his wife covers his garment with violence,”<span class="fn">b</span>  says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
