<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then you will know that I have sent you
this commandment so that My covenant with Levi may continue,” says
the LORD of Hosts. “My covenant with him was one of life and peace,

nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with Me in peace and
uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity. For the lips of a

made you despised and humiliated before all the people, because you
have not kept My ways, but have shown partiality in matters of the
law.” </font>
