</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not listen, and if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not take it to heart to <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> name,” says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, “I will send a curse among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and I will curse <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> blessings. Yes, I have already begun to curse them, because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are not taking it to heart.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Behold, I will rebuke <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> descendants,<span class="fn">a</span>  and I will spread dung on <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faces, the waste from <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> feasts, and you will be carried off with it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will know that I have sent <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> this commandment so that <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> covenant with Levi may continue,” says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
<span class="reftext">5</span>“My covenant with him was one of life and peace, which I gave to him; it called for reverence, and he revered <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> and stood in awe of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> name.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>True instruction was in his mouth, and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, because he is the messenger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have departed from the way, and your instruction has caused many to stumble. <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have violated the covenant of Levi,” says <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
<span class="reftext">9</span>“So I in turn have made <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> despised and humiliated before all the people, because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have not kept <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> ways, but have shown partiality in matters of the law.”

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Judah has broken faith; an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has profaned <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s beloved sanctuary by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.
<span class="reftext">12</span>As for the man who does this, may <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> cut off from the tents of Jacob everyone who is awake and aware—even if he brings an offering to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And this is another thing <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do: <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> cover the altar of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> with tears, with weeping and groaning, because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> no longer regards your offerings or receives them gladly from your hands.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Yet <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> ask, “Why?” </p><p class="reg1"> It is because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has been a witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have broken faith, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.

And why one? Because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> seeks godly offspring.
