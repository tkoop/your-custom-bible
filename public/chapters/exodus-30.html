“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You are also to make an altar of acacia
wood for the burning of incense. It is to be square, a cubit long, a
cubit wide, and two cubits high. Its horns must be of one piece.
Overlay with pure gold the top and all the sides and horns, and make
a molding of gold around it. And make two gold rings below the
molding on opposite sides to hold the poles used to carry it. Make
the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Place the altar in front of the veil that
is before the ark of the Testimony—before the mercy seat that is
over the Testimony—where I will meet with you. And Aaron is to burn
fragrant incense on it every morning when he tends the lamps. When
Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he must burn the incense
perpetually before the LORD for the generations to come. On this
altar you must not offer unauthorized incense or a burnt offering or
grain offering; nor are you to pour a drink offering on it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Once a year Aaron shall make atonement on
the horns of the altar. Throughout your generations he shall make
atonement on it annually with the blood of the sin offering of
atonement. The altar is most holy to the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “When you
take a census of the Israelites to number them, each man must pay the
LORD a ransom for his life when he is counted. Then no plague will
come upon them when they are numbered. Everyone who crosses over to
those counted must pay a half shekel, according to the sanctuary
shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs. This half shekel is an offering
to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Everyone twenty years of age or older who
crosses over must give this offering to the LORD. In making the
offering to the LORD to atone for your lives, the rich shall not give
more than a half shekel, nor shall the poor give less. Take the
atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the
Tent of Meeting. It will serve as a memorial for the Israelites
before the LORD to make atonement for your lives.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD said to Moses, “You are to
make a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing. Set it between
the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it, with which
Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet. Whenever they
enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the altar to minister by
presenting an offering made by fire to the LORD, they must wash with
water so that they will not die. Thus they are to wash their hands
and feet so that they will not die; this shall be a permanent statute
for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Take the
finest spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half that amount (250
shekels) of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant cane, 500
shekels of cassia —all according to the sanctuary shekel—and a
hin of olive oil. Prepare from these a sacred anointing oil, a
fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer; it will be a sacred anointing
oil. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Use this oil to anoint the Tent of
Meeting, the ark of the Testimony, the table and all its utensils,
the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense, the altar of
burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand.
You are to consecrate them so that they will be most holy. Whatever
touches them shall be holy. Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate
them to serve Me as priests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And you are to tell the Israelites, ‘This
will be My sacred anointing oil for the generations to come. It must
not be used to anoint an ordinary man, and you must not make anything
like it with the same formula. It is holy, and it must be holy to
you. Anyone who mixes perfume like it or puts it on an outsider shall
be cut off from his people.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD also said to Moses, “Take
fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha, galbanum, and pure
frankincense—in equal measures, and make a fragrant blend of
incense, the work of a perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy.
Grind some of it into fine powder and place it in front of the
Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It
shall be most holy to you. You are never to use this formula to make
incense for yourselves; you shall regard it as holy to the LORD.
Anyone who makes something like it to enjoy its fragrance shall be
cut off from his people.” </font>
