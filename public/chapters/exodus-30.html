<span class="reftext">2</span>It is to be square, a cubit long, a cubit wide, and two cubits high.<span class="fn">a</span>  Its horns must be of one piece.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Overlay with pure gold the top and all the sides and horns, and make a molding of gold around it.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And make two gold rings below the molding on opposite sides to hold the poles used to carry it.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Place the altar in front of the veil that is before the ark of the Testimony<span class="fn">b</span>—before the mercy seat that is over the Testimony—where I will meet with you.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And Aaron is to burn fragrant incense on it every morning when he tends the lamps.
<span class="reftext">8</span>When Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight,<span class="fn">c</span>  he must burn the incense perpetually before the LORD for the generations to come.
<span class="reftext">9</span>On this altar you must not offer unauthorized<span class="fn">d</span>  incense or a burnt offering or grain offering; nor are you to pour a drink offering on it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Once a year Aaron shall make atonement on the horns of the altar. Throughout your generations he shall make atonement on it annually with the blood of the sin offering<span class="fn">e</span>  of atonement. The altar is most holy to the LORD.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Census Offering<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Samuel 24:1–9; 1 Chronicles 21:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then the LORD said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">12</span>“When you take a census of the Israelites to number them, each man must pay the LORD a ransom for his life when he is counted. Then no plague will come upon them when they are numbered.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Everyone who crosses over to those counted must pay a half shekel,<span class="fn">f</span>  according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.<span class="fn">g</span>  This half shekel is an offering to the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Everyone twenty years of age or older who crosses over must give this offering to the LORD.
<span class="reftext">15</span>In making the offering to the LORD to atone for your lives, the rich shall not give more than a half shekel, nor shall the poor give less.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Take the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the Tent of Meeting. It will serve as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD to make atonement for your lives.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Bronze Basin<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 38:8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>And the LORD said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">18</span>“You are to make a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing. Set it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it,
<span class="reftext">19</span>with which Aaron and his sons are to wash their hands and feet.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the altar to minister by presenting an offering made by fire to the LORD, they must wash with water so that they will not die.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Thus they are to wash their hands and feet so that they will not die; this shall be a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants for the generations to come.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Anointing Oil</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then the LORD said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">23</span>“Take the finest spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh,<span class="fn">h</span>  half that amount (250 shekels) of fragrant cinnamon,<span class="fn">i</span>  250 shekels of fragrant cane,<span class="fn">j</span> 
<span class="reftext">24</span>500 shekels of cassia<span class="fn">k</span> —all according to the sanctuary shekel—and a hin of olive oil.<span class="fn">l</span> 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Prepare from these a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer; it will be a sacred anointing oil.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Use this oil to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony,
<span class="reftext">27</span>the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense,
<span class="reftext">28</span>the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand.
<span class="reftext">29</span>You are to consecrate them so that they will be most holy. Whatever touches them shall be holy.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them to serve Me as priests.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>And you are to tell the Israelites, ‘This will be My sacred anointing oil for the generations to come.
<span class="reftext">32</span>It must not be used to anoint an ordinary man, and you must not make anything like it with the same formula. It is holy, and it must be holy to you.
<span class="reftext">33</span>Anyone who mixes perfume like it or puts it on an outsider shall be cut off from his people.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Incense</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>The LORD also said to Moses, “Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense—in equal measures,
<span class="reftext">35</span>and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Grind some of it into fine powder and place it in front of the Testimony<span class="fn">m</span>  in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you.
<span class="reftext">37</span>You are never to use this formula to make incense for yourselves; you shall regard it as holy to the LORD.
<span class="reftext">38</span>Anyone who makes something like it to enjoy its fragrance shall be cut off from his people.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> The altar was approximately 1.5 feet in length and width, and 3 feet high (45.7 centimeters in length and width, and 91.4 centimeters high).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, <i class="calibre6">the ark of the covenant</i>; also in verse 26<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">between the two evenings</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">strange</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">purification offering</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">A half shekel</i> is approximately 0.2 ounces or 5.7 grams; also in verse 15.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">20 gerahs</i> is equivalent to one shekel (approximately 0.4 ounces or 11.4 grams).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">500 shekels</i> is approximately 12.6 pounds or 5.7 kilograms of myrrh.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> <i class="calibre6">250 shekels</i> is approximately 6.3 pounds or 2.9 kilograms of cinnamon.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> <i class="calibre6">250 shekels</i> is approximately 6.3 pounds or 2.9 kilograms of cane.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> <i class="calibre6">500 shekels</i> is approximately 12.6 pounds or 5.7 kilograms of cassia.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> <i class="calibre6">A hin</i> is approximately 0.97 gallons or 3.67 liters of olive oil.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">m</span> <i class="calibre6">The Testimony</i> refers to the stone tablets in the ark of the covenant inscribed with the Ten Commandments.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
