</p><p class="hdg">The People Offer Gifts</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then the whole congregation of Israel withdrew from the presence of Moses.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And everyone whose heart stirred him and whose spirit prompted him came and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its services, and for the holy garments.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So all who had willing hearts, both men and women, came and brought brooches and earrings, rings and necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewellery. And they all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Everyone who had blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, or fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red, or articles of fine leather, brought them.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And all who could present an offering of silver or bronze brought it as a contribution to the LORD. Also, everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the service brought it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun: blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, or fine linen.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And all the skilled women whose hearts were stirred spun the goat hair.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>The leaders brought onyx stones and gemstones to mount on the ephod and breastpiece,
<span class="reftext">28</span>as well as spices and olive oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>So all the men and women of the Israelites whose hearts prompted them brought a freewill offering to the LORD for all the work that the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do.
