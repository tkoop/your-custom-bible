</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Surely I am the most ignorant of men, </p><p class="indent"> and I lack the understanding of a man.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>I have not learned wisdom, </p><p class="indent"> and I have no knowledge of the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span>.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Who has ascended to <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> and come down? </p><p class="indent"> Who has gathered the wind in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> hands? </p><p class="indent1"> Who has bound up the waters in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> cloak? </p><p class="indent"> Who has established all the ends of the earth? </p><p class="indent1"> What is <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> name, and what is the name of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span>—</p><p class="indent"> surely you know!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Every word of God is flawless; </p><p class="indent"> He is a shield to those who take refuge in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Do not add to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> words, </p><p class="indent"> lest <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> rebuke you and prove you a liar.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>Two things I ask of <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>—</p><p class="indent"> do not refuse me before I die:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me. </p><p class="indent"> Give me neither poverty nor riches; </p><p class="indent"> feed me with the bread that is my portion.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Otherwise, I may have too much </p><p class="indent"> and deny <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>, saying, ‘Who is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>?’ </p><p class="indent1"> Or I may become poor and steal, </p><p class="indent"> profaning the name of my God.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Do not slander a servant to his master, </p><p class="indent"> or he will curse you, and you will bear the guilt.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>There is a generation of those who curse their fathers </p><p class="indent"> and do not bless their mothers.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>There is a generation of those who are pure in their own eyes </p><p class="indent"> and yet unwashed of their filth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>There is a generation—how haughty are their eyes </p><p class="indent"> and pretentious are their glances—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>there is a generation whose teeth are swords </p><p class="indent"> and whose jaws are knives, </p><p class="indent1"> devouring the oppressed from the earth </p><p class="indent"> and the needy from among men.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>The leech has two daughters: </p><p class="indent"> Give and Give. </p><p class="reg1"> There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, ‘Enough!’:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>Sheol, </p><p class="list1stline"> the barren womb, </p><p class="list1stline"> land never satisfied with water, </p><p class="list1stline"> and fire that never says, ‘Enough!’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>As for the eye that mocks a father </p><p class="indent"> and scorns obedience to a mother, </p><p class="indent1"> may the ravens of the valley pluck it out </p><p class="indent"> and young vultures devour it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>There are three things too wonderful for me, four that I cannot understand:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>the way of an eagle in the sky, </p><p class="list1stline"> the way of a snake on a rock, </p><p class="list1stline"> the way of a ship at sea, </p><p class="list1stline"> and the way of a man with a maiden.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>This is the way of an adulteress: </p><p class="indent"> She eats and wipes her mouth </p><p class="indent"> and says, ‘I have done nothing wrong.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>a servant who becomes king, </p><p class="list1stline"> a fool who is filled with food,
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>an unloved woman who marries, </p><p class="list1stline"> and a maidservant who supplants her mistress.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Four things on <span class='cap'>Earth</span><span class='nocap'>earth</span><span class='bsb'>earth</span> are small, yet they are exceedingly wise:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>The ants are creatures of little strength, yet they store up their food in the summer;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>the rock badgers<span class="fn">b</span>  are creatures of little power, yet they make their homes in the rocks;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>the locusts have no king, yet they all advance in formation;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">28</span>and the lizard can be caught in one’s hands, yet it is found in the palaces of kings.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>There are three things that are stately in their stride, and four that are impressive in their walk:
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">30</span>a lion, mighty among beasts, refusing to retreat before anything;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">31</span>a strutting rooster; </p><p class="list1stline"> a he-goat; </p><p class="list1stline"> and a king with his army around him.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">32</span>If you have foolishly exalted yourself </p><p class="indent"> or if you have plotted evil, </p><p class="indent"> put your hand over your mouth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>For as the churning of milk yields butter, </p><p class="indent"> and the twisting of the nose draws blood, </p><p class="indent"> so the stirring of anger brings forth strife.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">declared to Ithiel: “I am weary, O God, but I can prevail.</i> (revocalizations); Hebrew <i class="calibre6">declared to Ithiel—to Ithiel and Ucal:</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the coneys</i> or <i class="calibre6">the hyraxes</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a king against whom there is no rising up</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
