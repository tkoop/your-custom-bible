<font ><b>Joseph and Potiphar’s Wife</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, Joseph had been taken down to
Egypt, where an Egyptian named Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and
captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken
him there. And the LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful
man, serving in the household of his Egyptian master. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When his master saw that the LORD was with
him and made him prosper in all he did, Joseph found favor in his
sight and became his personal attendant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Potiphar put him in charge of his
household and entrusted him with everything he owned. From the time
that he put Joseph in charge of his household and all he owned, the
LORD blessed the Egyptian’s household on account of him. The LORD’s
blessing was on everything he owned, both in his house and in his
field. So Potiphar left all that he owned in Joseph’s care; he did
not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,
and after some time his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and
said, “Sleep with me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But he refused. “Look,” he said to his
master’s wife, “with me here, my master does not concern himself
with anything in his house, and he has entrusted everything he owns
to my care. No one in this house is greater than I am. He has
withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. So how
could I do such a great evil and sin against God?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Although Potiphar’s wife spoke to Joseph
day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be near her.
One day, however, Joseph went into the house to attend to his work,
and not a single household servant was inside. She grabbed Joseph by
his cloak and said, “Sleep with me!” But leaving his cloak in her
hand, he escaped and ran outside. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When she saw that he had left his cloak in
her hand and had run out of the house, she called her household
servants. “Look,” she said, “this Hebrew has been brought to us
to make sport of us. He came to me so he could sleep with me, but I
screamed as loud as I could. When he heard me scream for help, he
left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Potiphar’s wife kept Joseph’s cloak
beside her until his master came home. Then she told him the same
story: “The Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of
me, but when I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran
out of the house.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When his master heard the story his wife
told him, saying, “This is what your slave did to me,” he burned
with anger. So Joseph’s master took him and had him thrown into the
prison where the king’s prisoners were confined. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Joseph was there in the prison, the
LORD was with him and extended kindness to him, granting him favor in
the eyes of the prison warden. And the warden put all the prisoners
under Joseph’s care, so that he was responsible for all that was
done in the prison. The warden did not concern himself with anything
under Joseph’s care, because the LORD was with Joseph and gave him
success in whatever he did. </font>
