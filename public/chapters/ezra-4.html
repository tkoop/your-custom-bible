<font ><b>The Decree of Artaxerxes</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin
heard that the exiles were building a temple for the LORD, the God of
Israel, they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families,
saying, “Let us build with you because, like you, we seek your God
and have been sacrificing to Him since the time of King Esar-haddon
of Assyria, who brought us here.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other
heads of the families of Israel replied, “You have no part with us
in building a house for our God, since we alone must build it for the
LORD, the God of Israel, as Cyrus king of Persia has commanded us.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the people of the land set out to
discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to build. They
hired counselors against them to frustrate their plans throughout the
reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of
Persia. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes,
an accusation was lodged against the people of Judah and Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And in the days of Artaxerxes king of
Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his associates
wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. It was written in Aramaic and then
translated. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Rehum the commander and Shimshai the
scribe wrote the letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as
follows: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From Rehum the commander, Shimshai the
scribe, and the rest of their associates—the judges and officials
over Tripolis, Persia, Erech and Babylon, the Elamites of Susa, and
the rest of the peoples whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal
deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and elsewhere west of
the Euphrates. </font>

<font >(This is the text of the letter they sent
to him.) </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >To King Artaxerxes, </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From your servants, the men west of the
Euphrates: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Let it be known to the king that the Jews
who came from you to us have returned to Jerusalem. And they are
rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city, restoring its walls, and
repairing its foundations. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Let it now be known to the king that if
that city is rebuilt and its walls are restored, they will not pay
tribute, duty, or toll, and the royal treasury will suffer. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now because we are in the service of the
palace and it is not fitting for us to allow the king to be
dishonored, we have sent to inform the king that a search should be
made of the record books of your fathers. In these books you will
discover and verify that the city is a rebellious city, harmful to
kings and provinces, inciting sedition from ancient times. That is
why this city was destroyed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We advise the king that if this city is
rebuilt and its walls are restored, you will have no dominion west of
the Euphrates. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king sent this reply: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the
scribe, and the rest of your associates living in Samaria and
elsewhere in the region west of the Euphrates: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Greetings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The letter you sent us has been translated
and read in my presence. I issued a decree, and a search was
conducted. It was discovered that this city has revolted against
kings from ancient times, engaging in rebellion and sedition. And
mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem and exercised authority over
the whole region west of the Euphrates; and tribute, duty, and toll
were paid to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now, therefore, issue an order for these
men to stop, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order.
See that you do not neglect this matter. Why allow this threat to
increase and the royal interests to suffer? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the text of the letter from King
Artaxerxes was read to Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their
associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and
forcibly stopped them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus the construction of the house of God
in Jerusalem ceased, and it remained at a standstill until the second
year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. </font>
