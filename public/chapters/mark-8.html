<span><span class="reftext">2</span>“I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> three days and have nothing to eat.
<span class="reftext">3</span>If I send them home hungry, they will faint along the way. For some of them have come a great distance.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>His disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could anyone find enough bread to feed all these people?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">5</span>“How many loaves do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have?”</span> Jesus asked. </p><p class="reg1">“Seven,” they replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground.

And they distributed them to the crowd.
<span class="reftext">7</span>They also had a few small fish, and Jesus blessed them and ordered that these be set before them as well.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>The people ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And about four thousand men<span class="fn">a</span>  were present. </p><p class="reg1"> As soon as Jesus had dismissed the crowd,
<span class="reftext">10</span><span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> got into the boat with <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Jesus sighed deeply in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> spirit and said, <span>“Why does this generation demand a sign?

<span class="reftext">13</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> left them, got back into the boat, and crossed to the other side.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So they began to discuss with one another the fact that they had no bread.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Aware of their conversation, Jesus asked them, <span>“Why are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> debating about having no bread?

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>The man looked up and said, “I can see the people, but they look like trees walking around.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Once again Jesus placed <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> hands on the man’s eyes, and when he opened them his sight was restored, and he could see everything clearly.

</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">29</span>“But what about <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>?”</span> Jesus asked. <span>“Who do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> say I am?”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”
