<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">God’s Sword of Judgment</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Son of man, set your face against Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel
<span class="reftext">3</span>and tell her that this is what the LORD says: ‘I am against you, and I will draw My sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Because I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked, My sword will be unsheathed against everyone from south to north.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then all flesh will know that I, the LORD, have taken My sword from its sheath, not to return it again.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>But you, son of man, groan! Groan before their eyes with a broken heart and bitter grief.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And when they ask, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you are to say, ‘Because of the news that is coming. Every heart will melt, and every hand will go limp. Every spirit will faint, and every knee will turn to water.’ Yes, it is coming and it will surely happen, declares the Lord GOD.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">9</span>“Son of man, prophesy and tell them that this is what the Lord says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘A sword, a sword, </p><p class="indent"> sharpened and polished—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>it is sharpened for the slaughter, </p><p class="indent"> polished to flash like lightning! </p><p class="indent1"> Should we rejoice in the sceptre of My son? </p><p class="indent"> The sword despises every such stick.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The sword is appointed to be polished, </p><p class="indent"> to be grasped in the hand. </p><p class="indent1"> It is sharpened and polished, </p><p class="indent"> to be placed in the hand of the slayer.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>Cry out and wail, </p><p class="indent"> O son of man, </p><p class="indent1"> for the sword is wielded against My people; </p><p class="indent"> it is against all the princes of Israel! </p><p class="indent1"> They are tossed to the sword with My people; </p><p class="indent"> therefore strike your thigh.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Surely testing will come! </p><p class="indent"> And what if even the sceptre, </p><p class="indent1"> which the sword despises, </p><p class="indent"> does not continue?’ </p><p class="selah"> declares the Lord GOD.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>‘So then, son of man, </p><p class="indent"> prophesy and strike your hands together. </p><p class="indent1"> Let the sword strike two times, </p><p class="indent"> even three. </p><p class="indent1"> It is a sword that slays, </p><p class="indent"> a sword of great slaughter </p><p class="indent"> closing in on every side!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>So that their hearts may melt </p><p class="indent"> and many may stumble, </p><p class="indent1"> I have appointed at all their gates </p><p class="indent"> a sword for slaughter. </p><p class="indent1"> Yes, it is ready to flash like lightning; </p><p class="indent"> it is drawn for slaughter.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Slash to the right; </p><p class="indent"> set your blade to the left—</p><p class="indent"> wherever your blade is directed.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>I too will strike My hands together, </p><p class="indent"> and I will satisfy My wrath.’ </p><p class="selah"> I, the LORD, have spoken.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">19</span>“Now you, son of man, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to take, both starting from the same land. And make a signpost where the road branches off to each city.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Mark out one road for the sword to come against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and another against Judah into fortified Jerusalem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road, at the junction of the two roads, to seek an omen: He shakes the arrows, he consults the idols, he examines the liver.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>In his right hand appears the portent for Jerusalem, where he is to set up battering rams, to call for the slaughter, to lift a battle cry, to direct the battering rams against the gates, to build a ramp, and to erect a siege wall.
<span class="reftext">23</span>It will seem like a false omen to the eyes of those who have sworn allegiance to him, but it will draw attention to their guilt and take them captive.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Because you have drawn attention to your guilt, exposing your transgressions, so that your sins are revealed in all your deeds—because you have come to remembrance—you shall be taken in hand.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>And you, O profane and wicked prince of Israel, </p><p class="indent"> the day has come for your final punishment.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘Remove the turban, </p><p class="indent"> and take off the crown. </p><p class="indent1"> Things will not remain as they are: </p><p class="indent"> Exalt the lowly </p><p class="indent"> and bring low the exalted.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>A ruin, a ruin, </p><p class="indent"> I will make it a ruin! </p><p class="indent1"> And it will not be restored </p><p class="indent"> until the arrival of Him to whom it belongs, </p><p class="indent"> to whom I have assigned the right of judgment.<span class="fn">b</span>’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Now prophesy, son of man, and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says concerning the Ammonites and their contempt: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘A sword! A sword </p><p class="indent"> is drawn for slaughter, </p><p class="indent1"> polished to consume, </p><p class="indent"> to flash like lightning—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>while they offer false visions for you </p><p class="indent"> and lying divinations about you—</p><p class="indent1"> to be placed on the necks </p><p class="indent"> of the wicked who are slain, </p><p class="indent1"> whose day has come, </p><p class="indent"> the time of their final punishment.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">30</span>Return the sword to its sheath! </p><p class="indent1stline"> In the place where you were created, </p><p class="indent"> in the land of your origin, </p><p class="indent"> I will judge you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>I will pour out My anger upon you; </p><p class="indent"> I will breathe the fire of My fury against you; </p><p class="indent1"> I will hand you over to brutal men, </p><p class="indent"> skilled in destruction.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>You will be fuel for the fire. </p><p class="indent"> Your blood will stain your own land. </p><p class="indent1"> You will not be remembered, </p><p class="indent"> for I, the LORD, have spoken.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">beat your breast</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">of Him to whom it rightfully belongs, to whom I have given it.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
