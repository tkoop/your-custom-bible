<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Righteousness through Faith in Christ<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Romans 3:21–31)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> again, and it is a safeguard for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Watch out for those dogs, those workers of evil, those mutilators of the flesh!
<span class="reftext">3</span>For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh—
<span class="reftext">4</span>though I myself could have such confidence. </p><p class="reg1"> If anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more:
<span class="reftext">5</span>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin; a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;
<span class="reftext">6</span>as to zeal, persecuting the church; as to righteousness in the law, faultless.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>But whatever was gain to me I count as loss for the sake of Christ.
<span class="reftext">8</span>More than that, I count all things as loss compared to the surpassing excellence of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ
<span class="reftext">9</span>and be found in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, not having my own righteousness from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ,<span class="fn">a</span>  the righteousness from God on the basis of faith.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>I want to know Christ and the power of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> resurrection and the fellowship of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> sufferings, being conformed to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> death,
<span class="reftext">11</span>and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.
</p><p class="hdg">Pressing on toward the Goal</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,
<span class="reftext">14</span>I press on toward the goal to win the prize of God’s heavenly calling in Christ Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>All of us who are mature should embrace this point of view. And if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> think differently about some issue, God will reveal this to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> as well.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Nevertheless, we must live up to what we have already attained.
</p><p class="hdg">Citizenship in Heaven</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Join one another in following my example, brothers, and carefully observe those who walk according to the pattern we set for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For as I have often told <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> before, and now say again even with tears: Many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on earthly things.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>But our citizenship is in heaven, and we eagerly await a <span class='cap'>Savior</span><span class='nocap'>savior</span> from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,
<span class="reftext">21</span>who, by the power that enables <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> to subject all things to <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span>, will transform our lowly bodies to be like <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> glorious body.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">through the faithfulness of Christ</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
