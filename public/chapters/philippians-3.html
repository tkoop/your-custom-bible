<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.
It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it
is a safeguard for you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Watch out for those dogs, those workers of
evil, those mutilators of the flesh! For it is we who are the
circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in
Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh— though I
myself could have such confidence. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If anyone else thinks he has grounds for
confidence in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day,
of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin; a Hebrew of
Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, persecuting the
church; as to righteousness in the law, faultless. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But whatever was gain to me I count as
loss for the sake of Christ. More than that, I count all things as
loss compared to the surpassing excellence of knowing Christ Jesus my
Lord, for whom I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that
I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own
righteousness from the law, but that which is through faith in
Christ, the righteousness from God on the basis of faith. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I want to know Christ and the power of His
resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to
Him in His death, and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from
the dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Not that I have already obtained all this,
or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of
that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers, I do not
consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do:
Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press
on toward the goal to win the prize of God’s heavenly calling in
Christ Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">All of us who are mature should embrace
this point of view. And if you think differently about some issue,
God will reveal this to you as well. Nevertheless, we must live up to
what we have already attained. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Join one another in following my example,
brothers, and carefully observe those who walk according to the
pattern we set for you. For as I have often told you before, and now
say again even with tears: Many live as enemies of the cross of
Christ. Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and their
glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on earthly things. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But our citizenship is in heaven, and we
eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the
power that enables Him to subject all things to Himself, will
transform our lowly bodies to be like His glorious body. </font>
