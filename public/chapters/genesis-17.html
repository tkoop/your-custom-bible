<font ><b>Abraham to Father Many Nations</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the
LORD appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty. Walk before Me
and be blameless. I will establish My covenant between Me and you,
and I will multiply you exceedingly.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Abram fell facedown, and God said to
him, “As for Me, this is My covenant with you: You will be the
father of many nations. No longer will you be called Abram, but your
name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I will make you exceedingly fruitful; I
will make nations of you, and kings will descend from you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I will establish My covenant as an
everlasting covenant between Me and you and your descendants after
you, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And to you and your descendants I will
give the land where you are residing—all the land of Canaan—as an
eternal possession; and I will be their God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >God also said to Abraham, “You must keep
My covenant—you and your descendants in the generations after you.
This is My covenant with you and your descendants after you, which
you are to keep: Every male among you must be circumcised. You are to
circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and this will be a sign of the
covenant between Me and you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Generation after generation, every male
must be circumcised when he is eight days old, including those born
in your household and those purchased from a foreigner—even those
who are not your offspring. Whether they are born in your household
or purchased, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh
will be an everlasting covenant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if any male is not circumcised, he
will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai
your wife, do not call her Sarai, for her name is to be Sarah. And I
will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless
her, and she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will
descend from her.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Abraham fell facedown. Then he laughed and
said to himself, “Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred
years old? Can Sarah give birth at the age of ninety?” And Abraham
said to God, “O that Ishmael might live under Your blessing!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But God replied, “Your wife Sarah will
indeed bear you a son, and you are to name him Isaac. I will
establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his
descendants after him. As for Ishmael, I have heard you, and I will
surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly.
He will become the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into
a great nation. But I will establish My covenant with Isaac, whom
Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When He had finished speaking with
Abraham, God went up from him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On that very day Abraham took his son
Ishmael and all those born in his household or purchased with his
money—every male among the members of Abraham’s household—and
he circumcised them, just as God had told him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Abraham was ninety-nine years old when
he was circumcised, and his son Ishmael was thirteen; Abraham and his
son Ishmael were circumcised on the same day. And all the men of
Abraham’s household—both servants born in his household and those
purchased from foreigners—were circumcised with him. </font>
