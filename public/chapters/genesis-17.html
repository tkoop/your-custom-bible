<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Abraham to Father Many Nations</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty.<span class="fn">a</span>  Walk before Me and be blameless.
<span class="reftext">2</span>I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply you exceedingly.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Abram fell facedown, and God said to him,
<span class="reftext">4</span>“As for Me, this is My covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.
<span class="reftext">5</span>No longer will you be called Abram,<span class="fn">b</span>  but your name will be Abraham,<span class="fn">c</span>  for I have made you a father of many nations.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>I will make you exceedingly fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will descend from you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>I will establish My covenant as an everlasting covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And to you and your descendants I will give the land where you are residing—all the land of Canaan—as an eternal possession; and I will be their God.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Covenant of Circumcision</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>God also said to Abraham, “You must keep My covenant—you and your descendants in the generations after you.
<span class="reftext">10</span>This is My covenant with you and your descendants after you, which you are to keep: Every male among you must be circumcised.
<span class="reftext">11</span>You are to circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and this will be a sign of the covenant between Me and you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Generation after generation, every male must be circumcised when he is eight days old, including those born in your household and those purchased from a foreigner—even those who are not your offspring.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Whether they are born in your household or purchased, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh will be an everlasting covenant.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But if any male is not circumcised, he will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, do not call her Sarai, for her name is to be Sarah.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will descend from her.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Abraham fell facedown. Then he laughed and said to himself, “Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah give birth at the age of ninety?”
<span class="reftext">18</span>And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live under Your blessing!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>But God replied, “Your wife Sarah will indeed bear you a son, and you are to name him Isaac.<span class="fn">f</span>  I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
<span class="reftext">20</span>As for Ishmael, I have heard you, and I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He will become the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.
<span class="reftext">21</span>But I will establish My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>When He had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or purchased with his money—every male among the members of Abraham’s household—and he circumcised them, just as God had told him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,
<span class="reftext">25</span>and his son Ishmael was thirteen;
<span class="reftext">26</span>Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised on the same day.
<span class="reftext">27</span>And all the men of Abraham’s household—both servants born in his household and those purchased from foreigners—were circumcised with him.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">El-Shaddai</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Abram</i> means <i class="calibre6">exalted father</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Abraham</i> means <i class="calibre6">father of many</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Cited in Romans 4:17<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Both <i class="calibre6">Sarai</i> and <i class="calibre6">Sarah</i> mean <i class="calibre6">princess</i>; the change in spelling may reflect the difference in dialect between Ur and Canaan.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">Isaac</i> means <i class="calibre6">he laughs</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
