<font ><b>The Murder of Ish-bosheth</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now when Ish-bosheth son of Saul heard
that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel was
dismayed. Saul’s son had two men who were leaders of raiding
parties. One was named Baanah and the other Rechab; they were sons of
Rimmon the Beerothite of the tribe of Benjamin—Beeroth is
considered part of Benjamin, because the Beerothites fled to Gittaim
and have lived there as foreigners to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was
lame in his feet. He was five years old when the report about Saul
and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but
as she was hurrying to escape, he fell and became lame. His name was
Mephibosheth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon
the Beerothite, set out and arrived at the house of Ish-bosheth in
the heat of the day, while the king was taking his midday nap. They
entered the interior of the house as if to get some wheat, and they
stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah
slipped away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They had entered the house while
Ish-bosheth was lying on his bed, and having stabbed and killed him,
they beheaded him, took his head, and traveled all night by way of
the Arabah. They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron
and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul,
your enemy who sought your life. Today the LORD has granted vengeance
to my lord the king against Saul and his offspring.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But David answered Rechab and his brother
Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As surely as the LORD
lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress, when someone told
me, ‘Look, Saul is dead,’ and thought he was a bearer of good
news, I seized him and put him to death at Ziklag. That was his
reward for his news! How much more, when wicked men kill a righteous
man in his own house and on his own bed, shall I not now require his
blood from your hands and remove you from the earth!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David commanded his young men, and they
killed Rechab and Baanah. They cut off their hands and feet and hung
their bodies by the pool in Hebron, but they took the head of
Ish-bosheth and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron. </font>
