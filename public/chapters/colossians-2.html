<span class="reftext">2</span>that they may be encouraged in heart, knit together in love, and filled with the full riches of complete understanding, so that they may know the mystery of God, namely Christ,<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">3</span>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I say this so that no one will deceive <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> by smooth rhetoric.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For although I am absent from you in body, I am present with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in spirit, and I delight to see <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> orderly condition and firm faith in Christ.

<span class="reftext">7</span>rooted and built up in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, established in the faith as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, which are based on human tradition and the spiritual forces of the world rather than on Christ.
<span class="reftext">9</span>For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity dwells in bodily form.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have been made complete in Christ, who is the head over every ruler and authority.

<span class="reftext">12</span>And having been buried with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> in baptism, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were raised with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> through your faith in the power of God, who raised <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> from the dead.

He forgave us all our trespasses,
<span class="reftext">14</span>having <span class='spell ca'>cancelled</span><span class='spell gb'>cancelled</span><span class='spell us'>canceled</span> the debt ascribed to us in the decrees that stood against us. He took it away, nailing it to the cross!
<span class="reftext">15</span>And having disarmed the powers and authorities, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.

<span class="reftext">19</span>He has lost connection to the head, from whom the whole body, supported and knit together by its joints and ligaments, grows as God causes it to grow.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have died with Christ to the spiritual forces of the world, why, as though <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> still belonged to the world, do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> submit to its regulations:
<span class="reftext">21</span>“Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!”?
<span class="reftext">22</span>These will all perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Such restrictions indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-prescribed worship, their false humility, and their harsh treatment of the body; but they are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the mystery of God: Christ</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">in the cutting away of the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">but the body is of the Christ</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
