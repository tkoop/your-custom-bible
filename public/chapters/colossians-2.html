2</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Alive with Christ</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For I want you to know how much I am
struggling for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have
not met me face to face, that they may be encouraged in heart, knit
together in love, and filled with the full riches of complete
understanding, so that they may know the mystery of God, namely
Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I say this so that no one will deceive you
by smooth rhetoric. For although I am absent from you in body, I am
present with you in spirit, and I delight to see your orderly
condition and firm faith in Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore, just as you have received
Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to walk in Him, rooted and built up in
Him, established in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing
with thankfulness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">See to it that no one takes you captive
through philosophy and empty deception, which are based on human
tradition and the spiritual forces of the world rather than on
Christ. For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity dwells in bodily
form. And you have been made complete in Christ, who is the head over
every ruler and authority. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In Him you were also circumcised, in the
putting off of your sinful nature, with the circumcision performed by
Christ and not by human hands. And having been buried with Him in
baptism, you were raised with Him through your faith in the power of
God, who raised Him from the dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When you were dead in your trespasses and
in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with
Christ. He forgave us all our trespasses, having canceled the debt
ascribed to us in the decrees that stood against us. He took it away,
nailing it to the cross! And having disarmed the powers and
authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them
by the cross. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore let no one judge you by what you
eat or drink, or with regard to a feast, a New Moon, or a Sabbath.
These are a shadow of the things to come, but the body that casts it
belongs to Christ. Do not let anyone who delights in false humility
and the worship of angels disqualify you with speculation about what
he has seen. Such a person is puffed up without basis by his
unspiritual mind. He has lost connection to the head, from whom the
whole body, supported and knit together by its joints and ligaments,
grows as God causes it to grow. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If you have died with Christ to the
spiritual forces of the world, why, as though you still belonged to
the world, do you submit to its regulations: “Do not handle, do not
taste, do not touch!”? These will all perish with use, because they
are based on human commands and teachings. Such restrictions indeed
have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-prescribed worship,
their false humility, and their harsh treatment of the body; but they
are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh. </font>
