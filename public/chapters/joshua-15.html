<font ><b>Judah’s Inheritance</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the allotment for the clans of the
tribe of Judah extended to the border of Edom, to the Wilderness of
Zin at the extreme southern boundary: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.4cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >Their southern border started at the bay
on the southern tip of the Salt Sea, proceeded south of the Ascent of
Akrabbim, continued on to Zin, went over to the south of
Kadesh-barnea, ran past Hezron up to Addar, and curved toward Karka.
It proceeded to Azmon, joined the Brook of Egypt, and ended at the
Sea. This was their southern border. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >The eastern border was the Salt Sea as far

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >The northern border started from the bay
of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan, went up to Beth-hoglah,
proceeded north of Beth-arabah, and went up to the Stone of Bohan son
of Reuben. Then the border went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor,
turning north to Gilgal, which faces the Ascent of Adummim south of
the ravine. It continued along the waters of En-shemesh and came out
at En-rogel. From there the border went up the Valley of Hinnom along
the southern slope of the Jebusites (that is, Jerusalem) and ascended
to the top of the hill that faces the Valley of Hinnom on the west,
at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. From the hilltop the
border curved to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah, proceeded to
the cities of Mount Ephron, and then bent around toward Baalah (that
is, Kiriath-jearim). The border curled westward from Baalah to Mount
Seir, ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is,
Chesalon), went down to Beth-shemesh, and crossed to Timnah. Then it
went out to the northern slope of Ekron, curved toward Shikkeron,
proceeded to Mount Baalah, went on to Jabneel, and ended at the Sea. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >And the western border was the coastline
of the Great Sea. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These are the boundaries around the clans
of the descendants of Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >According to the LORD’s command to him,
Joshua gave Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion among the sons of
Judah—Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron. (Arba was the forefather of
Anak.) And Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak—the
descendants of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From there he marched against the
inhabitants of Debir (formerly known as Kiriath-sepher). And Caleb
said, “To the man who strikes down Kiriath-sepher and captures it,
I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage.” So Othniel son of
Caleb’s brother Kenaz captured the city, and Caleb gave his
daughter Acsah to him in marriage. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One day Acsah came to Othniel and urged
him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb
asked her, “What do you desire?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Give me a blessing,” she answered.
“Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me springs of
water as well.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower
springs. </font>
