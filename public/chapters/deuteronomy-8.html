<span class="reftext">2</span>Remember that these forty years <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God led you all the way in the wilderness, so that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> might humble you and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> commandments.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>He humbled you, and in your hunger <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> gave you manna to eat, which neither you nor your fathers had known, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> might understand that man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Your clothing did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.

<span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore you shall keep the commandments of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, walking in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> ways and fearing <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks and fountains and springs that flow through the valleys and hills;
<span class="reftext">8</span>a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey;
<span class="reftext">9</span>a land where you will eat food without scarcity, where you will lack nothing; a land whose rocks are iron and whose hills are ready to be mined for copper.
<span class="reftext">10</span>When you eat and are satisfied, you are to bless <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God for the good land that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has given you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Be careful not to forget <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God by failing to keep <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> commandments and ordinances and statutes, which I am giving you this day.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses in which to dwell,
<span class="reftext">13</span>and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all that you have is multiplied,
<span class="reftext">14</span>then your heart will become proud, and you will forget <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>He led you through the vast and terrifying wilderness with its venomous snakes and scorpions, a thirsty and waterless land. He brought you water from the rock of flint.
<span class="reftext">16</span>He fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers had not known, in order to humble you and test you, so that in the end <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> might cause you to prosper.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>You might say in your heart, “The power and strength of my hands have made this wealth for me.”
<span class="reftext">18</span>But remember that it is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God who gives you the power to gain wealth, in order to confirm <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> covenant that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> swore to your fathers even to this day.
