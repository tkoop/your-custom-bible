<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Remember <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> Your God</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>You must carefully follow every commandment I am giving you today, so that you may live and multiply, and enter and possess the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> swore to give your fathers.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Remember that these forty years <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God led you all the way in the wilderness, so that He might humble you and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep His commandments.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>He humbled you, and in your hunger He gave you manna to eat, which neither you nor your fathers had known, so that you might understand that man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Your clothing did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So know in your heart that just as a man disciplines his son, so <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God disciplines you.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore you shall keep the commandments of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, walking in His ways and fearing Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks and fountains and springs that flow through the valleys and hills;
<span class="reftext">8</span>a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey;
<span class="reftext">9</span>a land where you will eat food without scarcity, where you will lack nothing; a land whose rocks are iron and whose hills are ready to be mined for copper.
<span class="reftext">10</span>When you eat and are satisfied, you are to bless <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God for the good land that He has given you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Be careful not to forget <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God by failing to keep His commandments and ordinances and statutes, which I am giving you this day.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses in which to dwell,
<span class="reftext">13</span>and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all that you have is multiplied,
<span class="reftext">14</span>then your heart will become proud, and you will forget <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>He led you through the vast and terrifying wilderness with its venomous snakes and scorpions, a thirsty and waterless land. He brought you water from the rock of flint.
<span class="reftext">16</span>He fed you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers had not known, in order to humble you and test you, so that in the end He might cause you to prosper.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>You might say in your heart, “The power and strength of my hands have made this wealth for me.”
<span class="reftext">18</span>But remember that it is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God who gives you the power to gain wealth, in order to confirm His covenant that He swore to your fathers even to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>If you ever forget <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God and go after other gods to worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Like the nations that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has destroyed before you, so you will perish if you do not obey <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in Matthew 4:4 and Luke 4:4<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
