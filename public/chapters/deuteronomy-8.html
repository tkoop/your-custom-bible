<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You must carefully follow every
commandment I am giving you today, so that you may live and multiply,
and enter and possess the land that the LORD swore to give your
fathers. Remember that these forty years the LORD your God led you
all the way in the wilderness, so that He might humble you and test
you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would
keep His commandments. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He humbled you, and in your hunger He gave
you manna to eat, which neither you nor your fathers had known, so
that you might understand that man does not live on bread alone, but
on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD. Your clothing
did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty
years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So know in your heart that just as a man
disciplines his son, so the LORD your God disciplines you. Therefore
you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, walking in His
ways and fearing Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the LORD your God is bringing you into
a good land, a land of brooks and fountains and springs that flow
through the valleys and hills; a land of wheat, barley, vines, fig
trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey; a land where
you will eat food without scarcity, where you will lack nothing; a
land whose rocks are iron and whose hills are ready to be mined for
copper. When you eat and are satisfied, you are to bless the LORD
your God for the good land that He has given you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Be careful not to forget the LORD your God
by failing to keep His commandments and ordinances and statutes,
which I am giving you this day. Otherwise, when you eat and are
satisfied, when you build fine houses in which to dwell, and when
your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase
and all that you have is multiplied, then your heart will become
proud, and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you out of
the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He led you through the vast and terrifying
wilderness with its venomous snakes and scorpions, a thirsty and
waterless land. He brought you water from the rock of flint. He fed
you in the wilderness with manna that your fathers had not known, in
order to humble you and test you, so that in the end He might cause
you to prosper. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You might say in your heart, “The power
and strength of my hands have made this wealth for me.” But
remember that it is the LORD your God who gives you the power to gain
wealth, in order to confirm His covenant that He swore to your
fathers even to this day. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If you ever forget the LORD your God and
go after other gods to worship and bow down to them, I testify
against you today that you will surely perish. Like the nations that
the LORD has destroyed before you, so you will perish if you do not
obey the LORD your God. </font>
