</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">53</span>You are to take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess.
<span class="reftext">54</span>And you are to divide the land by lot according to your clans. Give a larger inheritance to a larger clan and a smaller inheritance to a smaller one. Whatever falls to each one by lot will be his. You will receive an inheritance according to the tribes of your fathers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">55</span>But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides; they will harass you in the land where you settle.
