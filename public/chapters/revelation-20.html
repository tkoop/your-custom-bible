<span class="reftext">2</span>He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he threw him into the Abyss, shut it, and sealed it over him, so that he could not deceive the nations until the thousand years were complete. After that, he must be released for a brief period of time.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then I saw the thrones, and those seated on them had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image, and had not received its mark on their foreheads or hands. And they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The rest of the dead did not come back to life until the thousand years were complete. This is the first resurrection.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection! The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> for a thousand years.
</p><p class="hdg">Satan Cast into the Lake of Fire</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>When the thousand years are complete, Satan will be released from his prison,
<span class="reftext">8</span>and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—to assemble them for battle. Their number is like the sand of the seashore.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And they marched across the broad expanse of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. But fire came down from <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span><span class="fn">a</span>  and consumed them.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and <span class='spell ca'>sulphur</span><span class='spell gb'>sulphur</span><span class='spell us'>sulfur</span>, into which the beast and the false prophet had already been thrown.
