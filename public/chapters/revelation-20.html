<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I saw an angel coming down from
heaven with the key to the Abyss, holding in his hand a great chain.
He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent who is the devil and
Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. And he threw him into the
Abyss, shut it, and sealed it over him, so that he could not deceive
the nations until the thousand years were complete. After that, he
must be released for a brief period of time. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I saw the thrones, and those seated
on them had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of
those who had been beheaded for their testimony of Jesus and for the
word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image,
and had not received its mark on their foreheads or hands. And they
came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The rest of the dead did not come back to
life until the thousand years were complete. This is the first
resurrection. Blessed and holy are those who share in the first
resurrection! The second death has no power over them, but they will
be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with Him for a
thousand years. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the thousand years are complete,
Satan will be released from his prison, and will go out to deceive
the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—to
assemble them for battle. Their number is like the sand of the
seashore. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And they marched across the broad expanse
of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved
city. But fire came down from heaven and consumed them. And the devil
who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur,
into which the beast and the false prophet had already been thrown.
There they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I saw a great white throne and the
One seated on it. Earth and heaven fled from His presence, and no
place was found for them. And I saw the dead, great and small,
standing before the throne. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">And there were open books, and one of them
was the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their
deeds, as recorded in the books. The sea gave up its dead, and Death
and Hades gave up their dead, and each one was judged according to
his deeds. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Death and Hades were thrown into the
lake of fire. This is the second death—the lake of fire. And if
anyone was found whose name was not written in the Book of Life, he
was thrown into the lake of fire. </font>
