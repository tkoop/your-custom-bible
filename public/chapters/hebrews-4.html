<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Sabbath Rest<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Genesis 2:1–3; Exodus 16:22–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore, while the promise of entering His rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be deemed to have fallen short of it.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For we also received the good news just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, since they did not share the faith of those who comprehended it.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Now we who have believed enter that rest. As for the others, it is just as God has said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“So I swore on oath in My anger, </p><p class="indent">‘They shall never enter My rest.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> And yet His works have been finished since the foundation of the world.
<span class="reftext">4</span>For somewhere He has spoken about the seventh day in this manner: “And on the seventh day God rested from all His works.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And again, as He says in the passage above: “They shall never enter My rest.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Since, then, it remains for some to enter His rest, and since those who formerly heard the good news did not enter because of their disobedience,
<span class="reftext">7</span>God again designated a certain day as “Today,” when a long time later He spoke through David as was just stated: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.
<span class="reftext">9</span>There remains, then, a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For whoever enters God’s rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from His.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same pattern of disobedience.
</p><p class="hdg">The Living Word<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Timothy 3:10–17)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it pierces even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Nothing in all creation is hidden from God’s sight; everything is uncovered and exposed before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we profess.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">not having been united in the faith of those who heard</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Psalm 95:11; also in verse 5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Genesis 2:2<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Psalm 95:7–8<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
