<font ><b>Forty-Eight Cities for the Levites</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again the LORD spoke to Moses on the
plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho: “Command the
Israelites to give, from the inheritance they will possess, cities
for the Levites to live in and pasturelands around the cities. The
cities will be for them to live in, and the pasturelands will be for
their herds, their flocks, and all their other livestock. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The pasturelands around the cities you are
to give the Levites will extend a thousand cubits from the wall on
every side. You are also to measure two thousand cubits outside the
city on the east, two thousand on the south, two thousand on the
west, and two thousand on the north, with the city in the center.
These areas will serve as larger pasturelands for the cities. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Six of the cities you give the Levites are
to be appointed as cities of refuge, to which a manslayer may flee.
In addition to these, give the Levites forty-two other cities. The
total number of cities you give the Levites will be forty-eight, with
their corresponding pasturelands. The cities that you apportion from
the territory of the Israelites should be given to the Levites in
proportion to the inheritance of each tribe: more from a larger tribe
and less from a smaller one.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
the Israelites and tell them: When you cross the Jordan into the land
of Canaan, designate cities to serve as your cities of refuge, so
that a person who kills someone unintentionally may flee there. You
are to have these cities as a refuge from the avenger, so that the
manslayer will not die until he stands trial before the assembly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The cities you select will be your six
cities of refuge. Select three cities across the Jordan and three in
the land of Canaan as cities of refuge. These six cities will serve
as a refuge for the Israelites and for the foreigner or stranger
among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may
flee there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If, however, anyone strikes a person with
an iron object and kills him, he is a murderer; the murderer must
surely be put to death. Or if anyone has in his hand a stone of
deadly size, and he strikes and kills another, he is a murderer; the
murderer must surely be put to death. If anyone has in his hand a
deadly object of wood, and he strikes and kills another, he is a
murderer; the murderer must surely be put to death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The avenger of blood is to put the
murderer to death; when he finds him, he is to kill him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Likewise, if anyone maliciously pushes
another or intentionally throws an object at him and kills him, or if
in hostility he strikes him with his hand and he dies, the one who
struck him must surely be put to death; he is a murderer. When the
avenger of blood finds the murderer, he is to kill him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if anyone pushes a person suddenly,
without hostility, or throws an object at him unintentionally, or
without looking drops a heavy stone that kills him, but he was not an
enemy and did not intend to harm him, then the congregation must
judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these
ordinances. The assembly is to protect the manslayer from the hand of
the avenger of blood. Then the assembly will return him to the city
of refuge to which he fled, and he must live there until the death of
the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if the manslayer ever goes outside the
limits of the city of refuge to which he fled and the avenger of
blood finds him outside of his city of refuge and kills him, then the
avenger will not be guilty of bloodshed because the manslayer must
remain in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. Only
after the death of the high priest may he return to the land he owns.
This will be a statutory ordinance for you for the generations to
come, wherever you live. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If anyone kills a person, the murderer is
to be put to death on the testimony of the witnesses. But no one is
to be put to death based on the testimony of a lone witness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are not to accept a ransom for the
life of a murderer who deserves to die; he must surely be put to
death. Nor should you accept a ransom for the person who flees to a
city of refuge and allow him to return and live on his own land
before the death of the high priest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not pollute the land where you live,
for bloodshed pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the
land on which the blood is shed, except by the blood of the one who
shed it. Do not defile the land where you live and where I dwell. For
I, the LORD, dwell among the Israelites.” </font>
