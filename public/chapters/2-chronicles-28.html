<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Idolatry of Ahaz</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ahaz was twenty years old when he became
king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. And unlike David his
father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD.
Instead, he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even made
cast images of the Baals. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moreover, Ahaz burned incense in the
Valley of Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire, according to
the abominations of the nations that the LORD had driven out before
the Israelites. And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high
places, on the hills, and under every green tree. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the LORD his God delivered Ahaz into
the hand of the king of Aram, who attacked him and took many captives
to Damascus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ahaz was also delivered into the hand of
the king of Israel, who struck him with great force. For in one day
Pekah son of Remaliah killed 120,000 valiant men in Judah. This
happened because they had forsaken the LORD, the God of their
fathers. Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the son of
the king, Azrikam the governor of the palace, and Elkanah the second
to the king. Then the Israelites took 200,000 captives from their
kinsmen—women, sons, and daughters. They also carried off a great
deal of plunder and brought it to Samaria. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was
there, and he went out to meet the army that returned to Samaria.
“Look,” he said to them, “because of His wrath against Judah,
the LORD, the God of your fathers, has delivered them into your hand.
But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches up to heaven.
And now you intend to reduce to slavery the men and women of Judah
and Jerusalem. But are you not also guilty before the LORD your God?
Now therefore, listen to me and return the captives you took from
your kinsmen, for the fierce anger of the LORD is upon you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then some of the leaders of the
Ephraimites—Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of
Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—stood
in opposition to those arriving from the war. “You must not bring
the captives here,” they said, “for you are proposing to bring
guilt upon us from the LORD and to add to our sins and our guilt. For
our guilt is great, and fierce anger is upon Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the armed men left the captives and the
plunder before the leaders and all the assembly. Then the men who
were designated by name arose, took charge of the captives, and
provided from the plunder clothing for the naked. They clothed them,
gave them sandals and food and drink, anointed their wounds, and put
all the feeble on donkeys. So they brought them to Jericho, the City
of Palms, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time King Ahaz sent for help from
the king of Assyria. The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah
and carried away captives. The Philistines had also raided the cities
of the foothills and the Negev of Judah, capturing and occupying
Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, and Gederoth, as well as Soco, Timnah, and
Gimzo with their villages. For the LORD humbled Judah because Ahaz
king of Israel had thrown off restraint in Judah and had been most
unfaithful to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came
to Ahaz but afflicted him rather than strengthening him. Although
Ahaz had taken a portion from the house of the LORD, from the royal
palace, and from the princes and had presented it to the king of
Assyria, it did not help him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the time of his distress, King Ahaz
became even more unfaithful to the LORD. Since Damascus had defeated
him, he sacrificed to their gods and said, “Because the gods of the
kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them that they
may help me.” But these gods were the downfall of Ahaz and of all
Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Ahaz gathered up the articles of the
house of God, cut them into pieces, shut the doors of the house of
the LORD, and set up altars of his own on every street corner in
Jerusalem. In every city of Judah he built high places to offer
incense to other gods, and so he provoked the LORD, the God of his
fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As for the rest of the acts of Ahaz and
all his ways, from beginning to end, they are indeed written in the
Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. And Ahaz rested with his
fathers and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he was not
placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And his son Hezekiah
reigned in his place. </font>
