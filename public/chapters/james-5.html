<font ><b>A Warning to the Rich</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Come now, you who are rich, weep and wail
over the misery to come upon you. Your riches have rotted and moths
have eaten your clothes. Your gold and silver are corroded. Their
corrosion will testify against you and consume your flesh like fire. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You have hoarded treasure in the last
days. Look, the wages you withheld from the workmen who mowed your
fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have
reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You have lived on earth in luxury and
self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in the day of
slaughter. You have condemned and murdered the righteous, who did not
resist you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Be patient, then, brothers, until the
Lord’s coming. See how the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the
soil—how patient he is for the fall and spring rains. You, too, be
patient and strengthen your hearts, because the Lord’s coming is
near. Do not complain about one another, brothers, so that you will
not be judged. Look, the Judge is standing at the door! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Brothers, as an example of patience in
affliction, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. See
how blessed we consider those who have persevered. You have heard of
Job’s perseverance and have seen the outcome from the Lord. The
Lord is full of compassion and mercy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Above all, my brothers, do not swear, not
by heaven or earth or by any other oath. Simply let your “Yes” be
yes, and your “No,” no, so that you will not fall under judgment.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Is any one of you suffering? He should
pray. Is anyone cheerful? He should sing praises. Is any one of you
sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and
anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered
in faith will restore the one who is sick. The Lord will raise him
up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore confess your sins to each other
and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a
righteous man has great power to prevail. Elijah was a man just like
us. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain
on the land for three and a half years. Again he prayed, and the
heavens gave rain, and the earth yielded its crops. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >My brothers, if one of you should wander
from the truth and someone should bring him back, consider this:
Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul
from death and cover over a multitude of sins. </font>
