“<font >If someone sins by failing to testify
when he hears a public charge about something he has witnessed,
whether he has seen it or learned of it, he shall bear the iniquity. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Or if a person touches anything
unclean—whether the carcass of any unclean wild animal or livestock
or crawling creature—even if he is unaware of it, he is unclean and
guilty. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Or if he touches human
uncleanness—anything by which one becomes unclean—even if he is
unaware of it, when he realizes it, he is guilty. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Or if someone swears thoughtlessly with
his lips to do anything good or evil—in whatever matter a man may
rashly pronounce an oath—even if he is unaware of it, when he
realizes it, he is guilty in the matter. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If someone incurs guilt in one of these
ways, he must confess the sin he has committed, and he must bring his
guilt offering to the LORD for the sin he has committed: a female
lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering. And the priest will
make atonement for him concerning his sin. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If, however, he cannot afford a lamb, he
may bring to the LORD as restitution for his sin two turtledoves or
two young pigeons—one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt
offering. He is to bring them to the priest, who shall first present
the one for the sin offering. He is to twist its head at the front of
its neck without severing it; then he is to sprinkle some of the
blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of
the blood is drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin
offering. And the priest must prepare the second bird as a burnt
offering according to the ordinance. In this way the priest will make
atonement for him for the sin he has committed, and he will be
forgiven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or
two young pigeons, he may bring a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as
a sin offering. He must not put olive oil or frankincense on it,
because it is a sin offering. He is to bring it to the priest, who
shall take a handful from it as a memorial portion and burn it on the
altar atop the offerings made by fire to the LORD; it is a sin
offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for him for any
of these sins he has committed, and he will be forgiven. The
remainder will belong to the priest, like the grain offering.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “If someone
acts unfaithfully and sins unintentionally against any of the LORD’s
holy things, he must bring his guilt offering to the LORD: an
unblemished ram from the flock, of proper value in silver shekels
according to the sanctuary shekel; it is a guilt offering. Regarding
any holy thing he has harmed, he must make restitution by adding a
fifth of its value to it and giving it to the priest, who will make
atonement on his behalf with the ram as a guilt offering, and he will
be forgiven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If someone sins and violates any of the
LORD’s commandments even though he was unaware, he is guilty and
shall bear his punishment. He is to bring to the priest an
unblemished ram of proper value from the flock as a guilt offering.
Then the priest will make atonement on his behalf for the wrong he
has committed in ignorance, and he will be forgiven. It is a guilt
offering; he was certainly guilty before the LORD.” </font>
