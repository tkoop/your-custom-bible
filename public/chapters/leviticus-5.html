</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Or if a person touches anything unclean—whether the carcass of any unclean wild animal or livestock or crawling creature—even if he is unaware of it, he is unclean and guilty.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Or if he touches human uncleanness—anything by which one becomes unclean—even if he is unaware of it, when he <span class='spell ca'>realizes</span><span class='spell gb'>realises</span><span class='spell us'>realizes</span> it, he is guilty.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Or if someone swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do anything good or evil—in whatever matter a man may rashly pronounce an oath—even if he is unaware of it, when he <span class='spell ca'>realizes</span><span class='spell gb'>realises</span><span class='spell us'>realizes</span> it, he is guilty in the matter.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>If someone incurs guilt in one of these ways, he must confess the sin he has committed,
<span class="reftext">6</span>and he must bring his guilt offering to the LORD for the sin he has committed: a female lamb or goat from the flock as a sin offering. And the priest will make atonement for him concerning his sin.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>If, however, he cannot afford a lamb, he may bring to the LORD as restitution for his sin two turtledoves or two young pigeons—one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.
<span class="reftext">8</span>He is to bring them to the priest, who shall first present the one for the sin offering. He is to twist its head at the front of its neck without severing it;
<span class="reftext">9</span>then he is to sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood is drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the priest must prepare the second bird as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he may bring a tenth of an ephah of fine flour<span class="fn">a</span>  as a sin offering. He must not put olive oil or frankincense on it, because it is a sin offering.
<span class="reftext">12</span>He is to bring it to the priest, who shall take a handful from it as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar atop the offerings made by fire to the LORD; it is a sin offering.
<span class="reftext">13</span>In this way the priest will make atonement for him for any of these sins he has committed, and he will be forgiven. The remainder will belong to the priest, like the grain offering.”

<span class="reftext">16</span>Regarding any holy thing he has harmed, he must make restitution by adding a fifth of its value to it and giving it to the priest, who will make atonement on his behalf with the ram as a guilt offering, and he will be forgiven.
