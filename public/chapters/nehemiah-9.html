<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The People Confess Their Sins</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth, with dust on their heads.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all the foreigners, and they stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>While they stood in their places, they read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day, and they spent another quarter of the day in confession and worship of the LORD their God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And the Levites—Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani—stood on the raised platform and cried out in a loud voice to the LORD their God.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah—said, “Stand up and bless the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting: </p><p class="indent1stline"> Blessed be Your glorious name, </p><p class="indent"> and may it be exalted </p><p class="indent"> above all blessing and praise.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>You alone are the LORD. </p><p class="indent"> You created the heavens, </p><p class="indent1"> the highest heavens with all their host, </p><p class="indent"> the earth and all that is on it, </p><p class="indent"> the seas and all that is in them. </p><p class="indent1"> You give life to all things, </p><p class="indent"> and the host of heaven worships You.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>You are the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> the God who chose Abram, </p><p class="indent1"> who brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans </p><p class="indent"> and gave him the name Abraham.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>You found his heart faithful before You, </p><p class="indent"> and made a covenant with him </p><p class="indent1"> to give the land of the Canaanites and Hittites, </p><p class="indent"> of the Amorites and Perizzites, </p><p class="indent"> of the Jebusites and Girgashites—</p><p class="indent1"> to give it to his descendants. </p><p class="indent"> You have kept Your promise, </p><p class="indent"> because You are righteous.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt; </p><p class="indent"> You heard their cry at the Red Sea.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, </p><p class="indent"> all his officials, and all the people of his land, </p><p class="indent1"> for You knew they had acted with arrogance </p><p class="indent"> against our fathers. </p><p class="indent1"> You made a name for Yourself </p><p class="indent"> that endures to this day.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>You divided the sea before them, </p><p class="indent"> and they crossed through it on dry ground. </p><p class="indent1"> You hurled their pursuers into the depths </p><p class="indent"> like a stone into raging waters.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>You led them with a pillar of cloud by day </p><p class="indent"> and a pillar of fire by night, </p><p class="indent1"> to light for them the way </p><p class="indent"> in which they should travel.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>You came down on Mount Sinai </p><p class="indent"> and spoke with them from heaven. </p><p class="indent1"> You gave them just ordinances, true laws, </p><p class="indent"> and good statutes and commandments.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>You revealed to them Your holy Sabbath </p><p class="indent"> and gave them commandments and statutes and laws </p><p class="indent"> through Your servant Moses.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>In their hunger You gave them bread from heaven; </p><p class="indent"> in their thirst You brought them water from the rock. </p><p class="indent1"> You told them to go in and possess the land </p><p class="indent"> which You had sworn to give them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>But they and our fathers became arrogant and stiff-necked </p><p class="indent"> and did not obey Your commandments.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>They refused to listen and failed to remember </p><p class="indent"> the wonders You performed among them. </p><p class="indent1"> They stiffened their necks and appointed a leader </p><p class="indent"> to return them to their bondage in Egypt.<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> But You are a forgiving God, </p><p class="indent"> gracious and compassionate, </p><p class="indent1"> slow to anger and rich in loving devotion, </p><p class="indent"> and You did not forsake them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>Even when they cast for themselves </p><p class="indent"> an image of a calf and said, </p><p class="indent1">‘This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,’ </p><p class="indent"> and when they committed terrible blasphemies,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>You in Your great compassion </p><p class="indent"> did not forsake them in the wilderness. </p><p class="indent1"> By day the pillar of cloud never turned away </p><p class="indent"> from guiding them on their path; </p><p class="indent1"> and by the night the pillar of fire </p><p class="indent"> illuminated the way they should go.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them. </p><p class="indent"> You did not withhold Your manna from their mouths, </p><p class="indent"> and You gave them water for their thirst.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>For forty years You sustained them in the wilderness, </p><p class="indent"> so that they lacked nothing. </p><p class="indent1"> Their clothes did not wear out </p><p class="indent"> and their feet did not swell.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>You gave them kingdoms and peoples </p><p class="indent"> and allotted to them every corner of the land. </p><p class="indent1"> So they took the land of Sihon<span class="fn">c</span>  king of Heshbon </p><p class="indent"> and of Og king of Bashan.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>You multiplied their descendants </p><p class="indent"> like the stars of heaven </p><p class="indent1"> and brought them to the land </p><p class="indent"> You had told their fathers to enter and possess.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So their descendants went in and possessed the land; </p><p class="indent"> You subdued before them the Canaanites dwelling in the land. </p><p class="indent1"> You delivered into their hands the kings and peoples of the land, </p><p class="indent"> to do with them as they wished.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>They captured fortified cities and fertile land </p><p class="indent"> and took houses full of all goods, </p><p class="indent1"> wells already dug, </p><p class="indent"> vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. </p><p class="indent1"> So they ate and were filled; </p><p class="indent"> they grew fat and delighted in Your great goodness.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>But they were disobedient and rebelled against You; </p><p class="indent"> they flung Your law behind their backs. </p><p class="indent1"> They killed Your prophets, </p><p class="indent"> who had admonished them to return to You. </p><p class="indent"> They committed terrible blasphemies.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>So You delivered them into the hands </p><p class="indent"> of enemies who oppressed them, </p><p class="indent"> and in their time of distress they cried out to You. </p><p class="indent1"> From heaven You heard them, </p><p class="indent"> and in Your great compassion You gave them deliverers </p><p class="indent"> who saved them from the hands of their enemies.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>But as soon as they had rest, </p><p class="indent"> they again did evil in Your sight. </p><p class="indent1"> So You abandoned them to the hands of their enemies, </p><p class="indent"> who had dominion over them. </p><p class="indent1"> When they cried out to You again, </p><p class="indent"> You heard from heaven, </p><p class="indent1"> and You delivered them many times </p><p class="indent"> in Your compassion.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">29</span>You admonished them to turn back to Your law, </p><p class="indent"> but they were arrogant and disobeyed Your commandments. </p><p class="indent1"> They sinned against Your ordinances, </p><p class="indent"> by which a man will live if he practices them. </p><p class="indent1"> They stubbornly shrugged their shoulders; </p><p class="indent"> they stiffened their necks and would not obey.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>You were patient with them for many years, </p><p class="indent"> and Your Spirit admonished them through Your prophets. </p><p class="indent1"> Yet they would not listen, </p><p class="indent"> so You gave them into the hands of the neighbouring peoples.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>But in Your great compassion, </p><p class="indent"> You did not put an end to them; </p><p class="indent1"> nor did You forsake them, </p><p class="indent"> for You are a gracious and compassionate God.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">32</span>So now, our God, the great and mighty and awesome God </p><p class="indent"> who keeps His gracious covenant, </p><p class="indent1"> do not view lightly all the hardship </p><p class="indent"> that has come upon us, </p><p class="indent1"> and upon our kings and leaders, </p><p class="indent"> our priests and prophets, </p><p class="indent1"> our ancestors and all Your people, </p><p class="indent"> from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>You are just in all that has befallen us, </p><p class="indent"> because You have acted faithfully, </p><p class="indent"> while we have acted wickedly.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Our kings and leaders and priests and fathers </p><p class="indent"> did not obey Your law </p><p class="indent1"> or listen to Your commandments </p><p class="indent"> and warnings that You gave them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>For even while they were in their kingdom, </p><p class="indent"> with the abundant goodness </p><p class="indent"> that You had given them, </p><p class="indent1"> and in the spacious and fertile land </p><p class="indent"> that You had set before them, </p><p class="indent1"> they would not serve You </p><p class="indent"> or turn from their wicked ways.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">36</span>So here we are today as slaves </p><p class="indent"> in the land You gave our fathers to enjoy its fruit and goodness—</p><p class="indent"> here we are as slaves!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">37</span>Its abundant harvest goes to the kings </p><p class="indent"> You have set over us because of our sins. </p><p class="indent1"> And they rule over our bodies and our livestock as they please. </p><p class="indent"> We are in great distress.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>In view of all this, we make a binding agreement, putting it in writing and sealing it with the names of<span class="fn">e</span>  our leaders, Levites, and priests.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Sea of Reeds</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> LXX and a few Hebrew manuscripts; MT <i class="calibre6">to return them to their bondage in their rebellion</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> One Hebrew manuscript and LXX; most Hebrew manuscripts <i class="calibre6">Sihon, the country of the</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">into the hands of the peoples of the lands</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">38</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew does not include <i class="calibre6">the names of</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
