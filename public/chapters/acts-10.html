<font ><b>Peter and Cornelius</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At Caesarea there was a man named
Cornelius, a centurion in what was called the Italian Regiment. He
and all his household were devout and God-fearing. He gave generously
to the people and prayed to God regularly. One day at about the ninth
hour, he had a clear vision of an angel of God who came to him and
said, “Cornelius!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Cornelius stared at him in fear and asked,
“What is it, Lord?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The angel answered, “Your prayers and
gifts to the poor have ascended as a memorial offering before God.
Now send men to Joppa to call for a man named Simon who is called
Peter. He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the
sea.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the angel who spoke to him had gone,
Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among
his attendants. He explained what had happened and sent them to
Joppa. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day at about the sixth hour, as
the men were approaching the city on their journey, Peter went up on
the roof to pray. He became hungry and wanted something to eat, but
while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He saw heaven open and something like a
large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. It contained
all kinds of four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth, as well
as birds of the air. Then a voice said to him: <font color="#a80000">“Get
up, Peter, kill and eat!”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >No, Lord!” Peter answered. “I have
never eaten anything impure or unclean.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The voice spoke to him a second time: <font color="#a80000">“Do
not call anything impure that God has made clean.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This happened three times, and all at once
the sheet was taken back up into heaven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Peter was puzzling over the meaning
of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found Simon’s house and
approached the gate. They called out to ask if Simon called Peter was
staying there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Peter continued to reflect on the
vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for
you. So get up! Go downstairs and accompany them without hesitation,
because I have sent them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Peter went down to the men and said,
“Here am I, the one you are looking for. Why have you come?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Cornelius the centurion has sent us,”
they said. “He is a righteous and God-fearing man with a good
reputation among the whole Jewish nation. A holy angel instructed him
to request your presence in his home so he could hear a message from
you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Peter invited them in as his guests.
And the next day he got ready and went with them, accompanied by some
of the brothers from Joppa. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The following day he arrived in Caesarea,
where Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his
relatives and close friends. As Peter was about to enter, Cornelius
met him and fell at his feet to worship him. But Peter helped him up.
“Stand up,” he said, “I am only a man myself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Peter talked with him, he went inside
and found many people gathered together. He said to them, “You know
how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with a foreigner or visit
him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or
unclean. So when I was invited, I came without objection. I ask,
then, why have you sent for me?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Cornelius answered: “Four days ago I was
in my house praying at this, the ninth hour. Suddenly a man in
radiant clothing stood before me and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer
has been heard, and your gifts to the poor have been remembered
before God. Therefore send to Joppa for Simon, who is called Peter.
He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, by the sea.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So I sent for you immediately, and you
were kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here in the presence
of God to listen to everything the Lord has instructed you to tell
us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Peter began to speak: “I now truly
understand that God does not show favoritism, but welcomes those from
every nation who fear Him and do what is right. He has sent this
message to the people of Israel, proclaiming the gospel of peace
through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You yourselves know what has happened
throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee with the baptism that John
proclaimed: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit
and with power, and how Jesus went around doing good and healing all
who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We are witnesses of all that He did, both
in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. And although they put Him
to death by hanging Him on a tree, God raised Him up on the third day
and caused Him to be seen— not by all the people, but by the
witnesses God had chosen beforehand, by us who ate and drank with Him
after He rose from the dead. And He commanded us to preach to the
people and to testify that He is the One appointed by God to judge
the living and the dead. All the prophets testify about Him that
everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins through His
name.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Peter was still speaking these
words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who heard his message. All the
circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were astounded that
the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.
For they heard them speaking in tongues and exalting God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Peter said, “Can anyone withhold
the water to baptize these people? They have received the Holy Spirit
just as we have!” So he ordered that they be baptized in the name
of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for a few days. </font>
