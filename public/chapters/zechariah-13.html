to the house of David and the people of Jerusalem, to cleanse them
from sin and impurity. And on that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, I
will erase the names of the idols from the land, and they will no

of impurity from the land. </font>

I work the land, for I was purchased as a servant in my youth.’ If
someone asks him, ‘What are these wounds on your chest?’ he will
answer, ‘These are the wounds I received in the house of my
friends.’ </font>
