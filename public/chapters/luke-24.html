<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Resurrection<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 28:1–10; Mark 16:1–8; John 20:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>On the first day of the week,<span class="fn">a</span>  very early in the morning, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.
<span class="reftext">2</span>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
<span class="reftext">3</span>but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
<span class="reftext">4</span>While they were puzzling over this, suddenly two men in radiant apparel stood beside them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>As the women bowed their faces to the ground in terror, the two men asked them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?
<span class="reftext">6</span>He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee:
<span class="reftext">7</span><span>‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then they remembered His words.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.
<span class="reftext">10</span>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles.
<span class="reftext">11</span>But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.
</p><p class="hdg">The Road to Emmaus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 16:12–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles<span class="fn">b</span>  from Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">14</span>They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And as they talked and deliberated, Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them.
<span class="reftext">16</span>But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>He asked them, <span>“What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> They stood still, with sadness on their faces.
<span class="reftext">18</span>One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">19</span>“What things?”</span> He asked. </p><p class="reg1">“The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and they crucified Him.
<span class="reftext">21</span>But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning,
<span class="reftext">23</span>but they did not find His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did not see.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span>“O foolish ones, how slow are your hearts to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
<span class="reftext">26</span>Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then to enter His glory?”</span>
<span class="reftext">27</span>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was written in all the Scriptures about Himself.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>As they approached the village where they were headed, He seemed to be going farther.
<span class="reftext">29</span>But they pleaded with Him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.” </p><p class="reg1"> So He went in to stay with them.
<span class="reftext">30</span>While He was reclining at the table with them, He took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to them.
<span class="reftext">31</span>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus—and He disappeared from their sight.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us as He spoke with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”
<span class="reftext">33</span>And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. </p><p class="reg1"> There they found the Eleven and those with them, gathered together
<span class="reftext">34</span>and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how they had recognized Jesus in the breaking of the bread.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Appears to the Disciples<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(John 20:19–23; 1 John 1:1–4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>While they were describing these events, Jesus Himself stood among them and said, <span>“Peace be with you.”</span>
<span class="reftext">37</span>But they were startled and frightened, thinking they had seen a spirit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">38</span>“Why are you troubled,”</span> Jesus asked, <span>“and why do doubts arise in your hearts?
<span class="reftext">39</span>Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself. Touch Me and see—for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”</span>
<span class="reftext">40</span>And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>While they were still in disbelief because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, <span>“Do you have anything here to eat?”</span>
<span class="reftext">42</span>So they gave Him a piece of broiled fish,<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">43</span>and He took it and ate it in front of them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.”</span>
<span class="reftext">45</span>Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>And He told them, <span>“This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,
<span class="reftext">47</span>and in His name repentance and forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">48</span>You are witnesses of these things.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">49</span>And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you. But remain in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”

<span class="reftext">51</span>While He was blessing them, He left them and was carried up into heaven.
<span class="reftext">52</span>And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
<span class="reftext">53</span>praising God continually in the temple.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">But on the first of the Sabbaths,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">being sixty stadia in distance</i>; that is, approximately 6.9 miles or 11.1 kilometers<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">42</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">and some honeycomb</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
