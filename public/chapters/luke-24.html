<font ><b>The Resurrection</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the first day of the week, very early
in the morning, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they
had prepared. They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but
when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
While they were puzzling over this, suddenly two men in radiant
apparel stood beside them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As the women bowed their faces to the
ground in terror, the two men asked them, “Why do you look for the
living among the dead? He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He
told you while He was still in Galilee: <font color="#a80000">‘The
Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be
crucified, and on the third day rise again.’</font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they remembered His words. And when
they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the
Eleven and to all the others. It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the
mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the
apostles. But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did
not believe the women. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter, however, got up and ran to the
tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he
went away, wondering to himself what had happened. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That same day two of them were going to a
village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. They were
talking with each other about everything that had happened. And as
they talked and deliberated, Jesus Himself came up and walked along
with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He asked them, <font color="#a80000">“What
are you discussing so intently as you walk along?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They stood still, with sadness on their
faces. One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only
visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened
there in recent days?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >What things?”</font>
He asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >The events involving Jesus of
Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in
speech and action before God and all the people. Our chief priests
and rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and they
crucified Him. But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem
Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things
took place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Furthermore, some of our women astounded
us. They were at the tomb early this morning, but they did not find
His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who
said that Jesus was alive. Then some of our companions went to the
tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did
not see.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“O
foolish ones, how slow are your hearts to believe all that the
prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer
these things and then to enter His glory?”</font> And beginning
with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was
written in all the Scriptures about Himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As they approached the village where they
were headed, He seemed to be going farther. But they pleaded with
Him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost
over.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So He went in to stay with them. While He
was reclining at the table with them, He took bread, spoke a blessing
and broke it, and gave it to them. Then their eyes were opened and
they recognized Jesus—and He disappeared from their sight. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They asked each other, “Were not our
hearts burning within us as He spoke with us on the road and opened
the Scriptures to us?” And they got up that very hour and returned
to Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There they found the Eleven and those with
them, gathered together and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and
has appeared to Simon!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the two told what had happened on the
road, and how they had recognized Jesus in the breaking of the bread.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While they were describing these events,
Jesus Himself stood among them and said, <font color="#a80000">“Peace
be with you.”</font> But they were startled and frightened,
thinking they had seen a spirit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Why are you
troubled,”</font> Jesus asked, <font color="#a80000">“and why do
doubts arise in your hearts? Look at My hands and My feet. It is I
Myself. Touch Me and see—for a spirit does not have flesh and
bones, as you see I have.”</font> And when He had said this, He
showed them His hands and feet. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While they were still in disbelief because
of their joy and amazement, He asked them, <font color="#a80000">“Do
you have anything here to eat?”</font> So they gave Him a piece of
broiled fish, and He took it and ate it in front of them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“These
are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything
must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the
Prophets, and the Psalms.”</font> Then He opened their minds to
understand the Scriptures. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And He told them, <font color="#a80000">“This
is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on
the third day, and in His name repentance and forgiveness of sins
will be proclaimed to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem. You are
witnesses of these things.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >And behold, I am
sending the promise of My Father upon you. But remain in the city
until you have been clothed with power from on high.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus had led them out as far as
Bethany, He lifted up His hands and blessed them. While He was
blessing them, He left them and was carried up into heaven. And they
worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, praising God
continually in the temple. </font>
