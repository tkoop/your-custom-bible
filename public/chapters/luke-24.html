<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Resurrection<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 28:1–10; Mark 16:1–8; John 20:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>On the first day of the week,<span class="fn">a</span>  very early in the morning, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.
<span class="reftext">2</span>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
<span class="reftext">3</span>but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
<span class="reftext">4</span>While they were puzzling over this, suddenly two men in radiant apparel stood beside them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>As the women bowed their faces to the ground in terror, the two men asked them, “Why do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> look for the living among the dead?
<span class="reftext">6</span>He is not here; <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has risen! Remember how <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> told <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> while <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was still in Galilee:
<span class="reftext">7</span><span>‘The <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of <span class='cap'>Man</span><span class='nocap'>man</span><span class='bsb'>Man</span> must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then they remembered <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> words.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.
<span class="reftext">10</span>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles.
<span class="reftext">11</span>But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.
</p><p class="hdg">The Road to Emmaus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 16:12–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles<span class="fn">b</span>  from Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">14</span>They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And as they talked and deliberated, Jesus <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span><span class='bsb'>Himself</span> came up and walked along with them.
<span class="reftext">16</span>But their eyes were kept from recognizing <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>He asked them, <span>“What are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> discussing so intently as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> walk along?”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> They stood still, with sadness on their faces.
<span class="reftext">18</span>One of them, named Cleopas, asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, “Are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">19</span>“What things?”</span> He asked. </p><p class="reg1">“The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Our chief priests and rulers delivered <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> up to the sentence of death, and they crucified <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span class="reftext">21</span>But we were hoping <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning,
<span class="reftext">23</span>but they did not find <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> they did not see.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span>“O foolish ones, how slow are your hearts to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
<span class="reftext">26</span>Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then to enter <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> glory?”</span>
<span class="reftext">27</span>And beginning with Moses and all the <span class='cap'>Prophets</span><span class='nocap'>prophets</span><span class='bsb'>Prophets</span>, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> explained to them what was written in all the <span class='cap'>Scriptures</span><span class='nocap'>scriptures</span><span class='bsb'>Scriptures</span> about <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span><span class='bsb'>Himself</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>As they approached the village where they were headed, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> seemed to be going farther.
<span class="reftext">29</span>But they pleaded with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.” </p><p class="reg1"> So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> went in to stay with them.
<span class="reftext">30</span>While <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was reclining at the table with them, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to them.
<span class="reftext">31</span>Then their eyes were opened and they <span class='spell ca'>recognized</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognized</span> Jesus—and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> disappeared from their sight.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> spoke with us on the road and opened the <span class='cap'>Scriptures</span><span class='nocap'>scriptures</span><span class='bsb'>Scriptures</span> to us?”
<span class="reftext">33</span>And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. </p><p class="reg1"> There they found the Eleven and those with them, gathered together
<span class="reftext">34</span>and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how they had <span class='spell ca'>recognized</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognized</span> Jesus in the breaking of the bread.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Appears to the Disciples<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(John 20:19–23; 1 John 1:1–4)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>While they were describing these events, Jesus <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span><span class='bsb'>Himself</span> stood among them and said, <span>“Peace be with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”</span>
<span class="reftext">37</span>But they were startled and frightened, thinking they had seen a spirit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">38</span>“Why are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> troubled,”</span> Jesus asked, <span>“and why do doubts arise in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hearts?
<span class="reftext">39</span>Look at <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> hands and <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> feet.

Touch <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> and see—for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> see I have.”</span>
<span class="reftext">40</span>And when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had said this, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> showed them <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> hands and feet.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>While they were still in disbelief because of their joy and amazement, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> asked them, <span>“Do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have anything here to eat?”</span>
<span class="reftext">42</span>So they gave <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> a piece of broiled fish,<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">43</span>and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> took it and ate it in front of them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“These are the words I spoke to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> while I was still with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> in the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span><span class='bsb'>Law</span> of Moses, the <span class='cap'>Prophets</span><span class='nocap'>prophets</span><span class='bsb'>Prophets</span>, and the Psalms.”</span>
<span class="reftext">45</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> opened their minds to understand the <span class='cap'>Scriptures</span><span class='nocap'>scriptures</span><span class='bsb'>Scriptures</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> told them, <span>“This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,
<span class="reftext">47</span>and in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> name repentance and forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">48</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are witnesses of these things.</span>
