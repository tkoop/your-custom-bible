<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Jephthah’s Tragic Vow</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty
man of valor; he was the son of a prostitute, and Gilead was his
father. And Gilead’s wife bore him sons who grew up, drove Jephthah
out, and said to him, “You shall have no inheritance in our
father’s house, because you are the son of another woman.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jephthah fled from his brothers and
settled in the land of Tob, where worthless men gathered around him
and traveled with him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Some time later, when the Ammonites fought
against Israel and made war with them, the elders of Gilead went to
get Jephthah from the land of Tob. “Come,” they said, “be our
commander, so that we can fight against the Ammonites.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead,
“Did you not hate me and expel me from my father’s house? Why
then have you come to me now, when you are in distress?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They answered Jephthah, “This is why we
now turn to you, that you may go with us, fight the Ammonites, and
become leader over all of us who live in Gilead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jephthah asked them, “If you take me
back to fight the Ammonites and the LORD gives them to me, will I
really be your leader?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah,
“The LORD is our witness if we do not do as you say.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jephthah went with the elders of
Gilead, and the people made him their leader and commander. And
Jephthah repeated all his terms in the presence of the LORD at
Mizpah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king
of the Ammonites, saying, “What do you have against me that you
have come to fight against my land?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king of the Ammonites answered
Jephthah’s messengers, “When Israel came up out of Egypt, they
seized my land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and all the way to the
Jordan. Now, therefore, restore it peaceably.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jephthah again sent messengers to the king
of the Ammonites to tell him, “This is what Jephthah says: Israel
did not take away the land of Moab or of the Ammonites. But when
Israel came up out of Egypt, they traveled through the wilderness to
the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. Then Israel sent messengers to the
king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let us pass through your land,’ but
the king of Edom would not listen. They also sent messengers to the
king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel stayed in Kadesh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Israel traveled through the
wilderness and bypassed the lands of Edom and Moab. They came to the
east side of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the
Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, since the Arnon
was its border. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king
of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, ‘Please let
us pass through your land into our own place.’ But Sihon would not
trust Israel to pass through his territory. So he gathered all his
people, encamped in Jahaz, and fought with Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD, the God of Israel,
delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, who
defeated them. So Israel took possession of all the land of the
Amorites who inhabited that country, seizing all the land from the
Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now since the LORD, the God of Israel, has
driven out the Amorites from before His people Israel, should you now
possess it? Do you not possess whatever your god Chemosh grants you?
So also, we possess whatever the LORD our God has granted us. Are you
now so much better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he
ever contend with Israel or fight against them? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For three hundred years Israel has lived
in Heshbon, Aroer, and their villages, as well as all the cities
along the banks of the Arnon. Why did you not take them back during
that time? I have not sinned against you, but you have done me wrong
by waging war against me. May the LORD, the Judge, decide today
between the Israelites and the Ammonites.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the king of the Ammonites paid no heed
to the message Jephthah sent him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon
Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, then through
Mizpah of Gilead. And from there he advanced against the Ammonites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jephthah made this vow to the LORD: “If
indeed You will deliver the Ammonites into my hand, then whatever
comes out the door of my house to greet me on my triumphant return
from the Ammonites will belong to the LORD, and I will offer it up as
a burnt offering.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites
to fight against them, and the LORD delivered them into his hand.
With a great blow he devastated twenty cities from Aroer to the
vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel-keramim. So the Ammonites were
subdued before the Israelites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And when Jephthah returned home to Mizpah,
there was his daughter coming out to meet him with tambourines and
dancing! She was his only child; he had no son or daughter besides
her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As soon as Jephthah saw her, he tore his
clothes and said, “No! Not my daughter! You have brought me to my
knees! You have brought great misery upon me, for I have given my
word to the LORD and cannot take it back.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">My father,” she replied, “you have
given your word to the LORD. Do to me as you have said, for the LORD
has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.” She also said to
her father, “Let me do this one thing: Let me wander for two months
through the mountains with my friends and mourn my virginity.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go,” he said. And he sent her away
for two months. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So she left with her friends and mourned
her virginity upon the mountains. After two months, she returned to
her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she had never had
relations with a man. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So it has become a custom in Israel that
each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to lament
the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite. </font>
