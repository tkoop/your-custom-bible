<font >Jesus also said to His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“There
was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.
So he called him in to ask, ‘What is this I hear about you? Turn in
an account of your management, for you cannot be manager any longer.’</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The manager said to
himself, ‘What shall I do, now that my master is taking away my
position? I am too weak to dig and too ashamed to beg. I know what I
will do, so that after my removal from management, people will
welcome me into their homes.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >And he called in
each one of his master’s debtors. ‘How much do you owe my
master?’ he asked the first. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000">‘<font >A hundred

<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Take your bill,’
said the manager. ‘Sit down quickly, and write fifty.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Then he asked
another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ </font></font>

<font color="#a80000">‘<font >A hundred

<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Take your bill

<font color="#a80000"><font >The master commended
the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of
this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the
sons of light. I tell you, use worldly wealth to make friends for
yourselves, so that when it is gone, they will welcome you into
eternal dwellings. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Whoever is faithful
with very little will also be faithful with much, and whoever is
dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. So if
you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will entrust you
with true riches? And if you have not been faithful with the
belongings of another, who will give you belongings of your own? </font></font>

two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he
will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve
both God and money.” </font></font>

<font >The Pharisees, who were lovers of money,
heard all of this and were scoffing at Jesus. So He said to them,
<font color="#a80000">“You are the ones who justify yourselves
before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is prized among men
is detestable before God.</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The Law and the
Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the gospel of
the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way
into it. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for
a single stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Now there was a rich
man dressed in purple and fine linen, who lived each day in joyous
splendor. And a beggar named Lazarus lay at his gate, covered with
sores and longing to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich
man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >One day the beggar
died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side. And the rich

fire.’ </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >But Abraham
answered, ‘Child, remember that during your lifetime you received
your good things, while Lazarus received bad things. But now he is
comforted here, while you are in agony. And besides all this, a great
chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that even those who wish
cannot cross from here to you, nor can anyone cross from there to
us.’ </font></font>
