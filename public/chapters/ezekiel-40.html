<font ><b>The Man with a Measuring Rod</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at
the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month—in the
fourteenth year after Jerusalem had been struck down—on that very
day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and He took me there. In
visions of God He took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very
high mountain, on whose southern slope was a structure that resembled
a city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So He took me there, and I saw a man whose
appearance was like bronze. He was standing in the gateway with a
linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. “Son of man,” he said
to me, “look with your eyes, hear with your ears, and pay attention
to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been
brought here. Report to the house of Israel everything you see.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And I saw a wall surrounding the temple
area. Now the length of the measuring rod in the man’s hand was six
long cubits (each measuring a cubit and a handbreadth), and he
measured the wall to be one rod thick and one rod high. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he came to the gate facing east and
climbed its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate to be one
rod deep. Each gate chamber was one rod long and one rod wide, and
there were five cubits between the gate chambers. The inner threshold
of the gate by the portico facing inward was one rod deep. Then he
measured the portico of the gateway inside; it was eight cubits deep,
and its jambs were two cubits thick. And the portico of the gateway
faced the temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There were three gate chambers on each
side of the east gate, each with the same measurements, and the
gateposts on either side also had the same measurements. And he
measured the width of the gateway entrance to be ten cubits, and its
length was thirteen cubits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In front of each gate chamber was a wall
one cubit high, and the gate chambers were six cubits square. Then he
measured the gateway from the roof of one gate chamber to the roof of
the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from doorway to
doorway. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next he measured the gateposts to be sixty
cubits high. The gateway extended around to the gatepost of the
courtyard. And the distance from the entrance of the gateway to the
far end of its inner portico was fifty cubits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The gate chambers and their side pillars
had beveled windows all around the inside of the gateway. The
porticos also had windows all around on the inside. Each side pillar
was decorated with palm trees. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he brought me into the outer court,
and there were chambers and a pavement laid out all around the court.
Thirty chambers faced the pavement, which flanked the gateways and
corresponded to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he measured the distance from the
front of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was
a hundred cubits on the east side as well as on the north. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He also measured the length and width of
the gateway of the outer court facing north. Its three gate chambers
on each side, its side pillars, and its portico all had the same
measurements as the first gate: fifty cubits long and twenty-five
cubits wide. Its windows, portico, and palm trees had the same
measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to
it, with its portico opposite them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There was a gate to the inner court facing
the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured the
distance from gateway to gateway to be a hundred cubits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he led me to the south side, and I
saw a gateway facing south. He measured its side pillars and portico,
and they had the same measurements as the others. Both the gateway
and its portico had windows all around, like the other windows. It
was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. Seven steps led up
to it, and its portico was opposite them; it had palm trees on its
side pillars, one on each side. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The inner court also had a gate facing
south, and he measured the distance from gateway to gateway toward
the south to be a hundred cubits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next he brought me into the inner court
through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the
same measurements as the others. Its gate chambers, side pillars, and
portico had the same measurements as the others. Both the gateway and
its portico had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and
twenty-five cubits wide. (The porticoes around the inner court were
twenty-five cubits long and five cubits deep.) Its portico faced the
outer court, and its side pillars were decorated with palm trees.
Eight steps led up to it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And he brought me to the inner court on
the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same
measurements as the others. Its gate chambers, side pillars, and
portico had the same measurements as the others. Both the gateway and
its portico had windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and
twenty-five cubits wide. Its portico faced the outer court, and its
side pillars were decorated with palm trees on each side. Eight steps
led up to it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he brought me to the north gate and
measured it. It had the same measurements as the others, as did its
gate chambers, side pillars, and portico. It also had windows all
around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. Its
portico faced the outer court, and its side pillars were decorated
with palm trees on each side. Eight steps led up to it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There was a chamber with a doorway by the
portico in each of the inner gateways. There the burnt offering was
to be washed. Inside the portico of the gateway were two tables on
each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt
offerings were to be slaughtered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Outside, as one goes up to the entrance of
the north gateway, there were two tables on one side and two more
tables on the other side of the gate’s portico. So there were four
tables inside the gateway and four outside—eight tables in all—on
which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There were also four tables of dressed
stone for the burnt offering, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit
and a half wide, and a cubit high. On these were placed the utensils
used to slaughter the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The double-pronged hooks, each a
handbreadth long, were fastened all around the inside of the room,
and the flesh of the offering was to be placed on the tables. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Outside the inner gate, within the inner
court, were two chambers, one beside the north gate and facing south,
and another beside the south gate and facing north. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the man said to me: “The chamber
that faces south is for the priests who keep charge of the temple,
and the chamber that faces north is for the priests who keep charge
of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, the only Levites who may
approach the LORD to minister before Him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next he measured the court. It was square,
a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in
front of the temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he brought me to the portico of the
temple and measured the side pillars of the portico to be five cubits
on each side. The width of the gateway was fourteen cubits and its
sidewalls were three cubits on either side. The portico was twenty
cubits wide and twelve cubits deep, and ten steps led up to it. There
were columns by the side pillars, one on each side. </font>
