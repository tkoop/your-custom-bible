<font ><b>The Glory of the LORD Returns to the
Temple</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the man brought me back to the gate
that faces east, and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from
the east. His voice was like the roar of many waters, and the earth
shone with His glory. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The vision I saw was like the vision I had
seen when He came to destroy the city and like the visions I had seen
by the River Kebar. I fell facedown, and the glory of the LORD
entered the temple through the gate facing east. Then the Spirit
lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of
the LORD filled the temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While the man was standing beside me, I
heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple, and He said to
me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place for
the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the Israelites
forever. The house of Israel will never again defile My holy
name—neither they nor their kings—by their prostitution and by
the funeral offerings for their kings at their deaths. When they
placed their threshold next to My threshold and their doorposts
beside My doorposts, with only a wall between Me and them, they
defiled My holy name by the abominations they committed. Therefore I
have consumed them in My anger. Now let them remove far from Me their
prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings, and I will
dwell among them forever. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for you, son of man, describe the
temple to the people of Israel, so that they may be ashamed of their
iniquities. Let them measure the plan, and if they are ashamed of all
they have done, then make known to them the design of the temple—its
arrangement and its exits and entrances—its whole design along with
all its statutes, forms, and laws. Write it down in their sight, so
that they may keep its complete design and all its statutes and may
carry them out. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the law of the temple: All its
surrounding territory on top of the mountain will be most holy. Yes,
this is the law of the temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >These are the measurements of the altar in
long cubits (a cubit and a handbreadth): Its gutter shall be a cubit
deep and a cubit wide, with a rim of one span around its edge. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And this is the height of the altar: The
space from the gutter on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two
cubits, and the ledge one cubit wide. The space from the smaller
ledge to the larger ledge shall be four cubits, and the ledge one
cubit wide. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The altar hearth shall be four cubits
high, and four horns shall project upward from the hearth. The altar
hearth shall be square at its four corners, twelve cubits long and
twelve cubits wide. The ledge shall also be square, fourteen cubits
long and fourteen cubits wide, with a rim of half a cubit and a
gutter of a cubit all around it. The steps of the altar shall face
east.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He said to me: “Son of man, this is
what the Lord GOD says: ‘These are the statutes for the altar on
the day it is constructed, so that burnt offerings may be sacrificed
on it and blood may be sprinkled on it: You are to give a young bull
from the herd as a sin offering to the Levitical priests who are of
the family of Zadok, who approach Me to minister before Me, declares
the Lord GOD. You are to take some of its blood and put it on the
four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and all
around the rim; thus you will cleanse the altar and make atonement
for it. Then you are to take away the bull for the sin offering and
burn it in the appointed part of the temple area outside the
sanctuary. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the second day you are to present an
unblemished male goat as a sin offering, and the altar is to be
cleansed as it was with the bull. When you have finished the
purification, you are to present a young, unblemished bull and an
unblemished ram from the flock. You must present them before the
LORD; the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and sacrifice them as
a burnt offering to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For seven days you are to provide a male
goat daily for a sin offering; you are also to provide a young bull
and a ram from the flock, both unblemished. For seven days the
priests are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; so they
shall consecrate it. At the end of these days, from the eighth day
on, the priests are to present your burnt offerings and peace
offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, declares the Lord
GOD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
