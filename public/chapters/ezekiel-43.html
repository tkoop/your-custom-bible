<span class="reftext">2</span>and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. His voice was like the roar of many waters, and the earth shone with <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> glory.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> came<span class="fn">a</span>  to destroy the city and like the visions I had seen by the River Kebar. I fell facedown,
<span class="reftext">4</span>and the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> entered the temple through the gate facing east.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> filled the temple.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple,
<span class="reftext">7</span>and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> throne and the place for the soles of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> feet, where I will dwell among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel will never again defile <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> holy name—neither they nor their kings—by their prostitution and by the funeral offerings<span class="fn">b</span>  for their kings at their deaths.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">8</span>When they placed their threshold next to <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> threshold and their doorposts beside <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> doorposts, with only a wall between <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> and them, they defiled <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> holy name by the abominations they committed. Therefore I have consumed them in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> anger.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Now let them remove far from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> their prostitution and the funeral offerings for their kings, and I will dwell among them forever.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the people of Israel, so that they may be ashamed of their iniquities. Let them measure the plan,
<span class="reftext">11</span>and if they are ashamed<span class="fn">d</span>  of all they have done, then make known to them the design of the temple—its arrangement and its exits and entrances—its whole design along with all its statutes, forms, and laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may keep its complete design and all its statutes and may carry them out.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>This is the law of the temple: All its surrounding territory on top of the mountain will be most holy. Yes, this is the law of the temple.
</p><p class="hdg">The Altar of Sacrifice</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits<span class="fn">e</span>  (a cubit and a handbreadth): Its gutter shall be a cubit deep and a cubit wide, with a rim of one span<span class="fn">f</span>  around its edge. </p><p class="reg1"> And this is the height of the altar:
<span class="reftext">14</span>The space from the gutter on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the ledge one cubit wide.<span class="fn">g</span>  The space from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge shall be four cubits, and the ledge one cubit wide.<span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The altar hearth shall be four cubits high, and four horns shall project upward from the hearth.
<span class="reftext">16</span>The altar hearth shall be square at its four corners, twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide.<span class="fn">i</span> 
<span class="reftext">17</span>The ledge shall also be square, fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide,<span class="fn">j</span>  with a rim of half a cubit<span class="fn">k</span>  and a gutter of a cubit all around it. The steps of the altar shall face east.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said to me: “Son of man, this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘These are the statutes for the altar on the day it is constructed, so that burnt offerings may be sacrificed on it and blood may be sprinkled on it:
<span class="reftext">19</span>You are to give a young bull from the herd as a sin offering to the Levitical priests who are of the family of Zadok, who approach <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> to minister before <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, declares the Lord GOD.
<span class="reftext">20</span>You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and all around the rim; thus you will cleanse the altar and make atonement for it.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Then you are to take away the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the appointed part of the temple area outside the sanctuary.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>On the second day you are to present an unblemished male goat as a sin offering, and the altar is to be cleansed as it was with the bull.
<span class="reftext">23</span>When you have finished the purification, you are to present a young, unblemished bull and an unblemished ram from the flock.
<span class="reftext">24</span>You must present them before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>; the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and sacrifice them as a burnt offering to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>For seven days you are to provide a male goat daily for a sin offering; <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are also to provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both unblemished.
<span class="reftext">26</span>For seven days the priests are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; so they shall consecrate it.<span class="fn">l</span> 
<span class="reftext">27</span>At the end of these days, from the eighth day on, the priests are to present <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar.
