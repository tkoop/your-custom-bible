<font >During Jehoiakim’s reign, Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon invaded. So Jehoiakim became his vassal for three
years, until he turned and rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And the LORD sent Chaldean, Aramean,
Moabite, and Ammonite raiders against Jehoiakim in order to destroy
Judah, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through His
servants the prophets. Surely this happened to Judah at the LORD’s
command, to remove them from His presence because of the sins of
Manasseh and all that he had done, and also for the innocent blood he
had shed. For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the
LORD was unwilling to forgive. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim,
along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book
of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And Jehoiakim rested with his fathers, and
his son Jehoiachin reigned in his place. </font>

<font >Now the king of Egypt did not march out of
his land again, because the king of Babylon had taken all his
territory, from the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s
name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem. And
he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his father had done. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >At that time the servants of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched up to Jerusalem, and the city
came under siege. And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to the city
while his servants were besieging it. Jehoiachin king of Judah, his
mother, his servants, his commanders, and his officials all
surrendered to the king of Babylon. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So in the eighth year of his reign, the
king of Babylon took him captive. As the LORD had declared,
Nebuchadnezzar also carried off all the treasures from the house of
the LORD and the royal palace, and he cut into pieces all the gold
articles that Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the
LORD. He carried into exile all Jerusalem—all the commanders and
mighty men of valor, all the craftsmen and metalsmiths—ten thousand
captives in all. Only the poorest people of the land remained. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Nebuchadnezzar carried away Jehoiachin to
Babylon, as well as the king’s mother, his wives, his officials,
and the leading men of the land. He took them into exile from
Jerusalem to Babylon. The king of Babylon also brought into exile to
Babylon all seven thousand men of valor and a thousand craftsmen and
metalsmiths—all strong and fit for battle. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the king of Babylon made Mattaniah,
Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in his place and changed his name to
Zedekiah. </font>

king of Babylon. </font>
