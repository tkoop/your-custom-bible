</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And the LORD sent Chaldean,<span class="fn">a</span>  Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite raiders against Jehoiakim in order to destroy Judah, according to the word that the LORD had spoken through His servants the prophets.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Surely this happened to Judah at the LORD’s command, to remove them from His presence because of the sins of Manasseh and all that he had done,
<span class="reftext">4</span>and also for the innocent blood he had shed. For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the LORD was unwilling to forgive.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>As for the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

<span class="reftext">12</span>Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his servants, his commanders, and his officials all surrendered to the king of Babylon. </p><p class="reg1"> So in the eighth year of his reign, the king of Babylon took him captive.
<span class="reftext">13</span>As the LORD had declared, Nebuchadnezzar also carried off all the treasures from the house of the LORD and the royal palace, and he cut into pieces all the gold articles that Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD.
<span class="reftext">14</span>He carried into exile all Jerusalem—all the commanders and mighty men of valor, all the craftsmen and metalsmiths—ten thousand captives in all. Only the poorest people of the land remained.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Nebuchadnezzar carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, as well as the king’s mother, his wives, his officials, and the leading men of the land. He took them into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
