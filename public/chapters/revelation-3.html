<span class="reftext">2</span>Wake up and strengthen what remains, which was about to die; for I have found your deeds incomplete in the sight of My God.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Remember, then, what you have received and heard. Keep it and repent. If you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know the hour when I will come upon you.
</p><p class="tab1stlinered"><span class="reftext">4</span>But you do have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments, and because they are worthy, they will walk with Me in white.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Like them, he who overcomes will be dressed in white. And I will never blot out<span class="fn">b</span>  his name from the Book of Life, but I will confess his name before My Father and His angels.

<span class="reftext">9</span>Look at those who belong to the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews but are liars instead. I will make them come and bow down at your feet, and they will know that I love you.
</p><p class="tab1stlinered"><span class="reftext">10</span>Because you have kept My command to persevere, I will also keep you from the hour of testing that is about to come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.
<span class="reftext">11</span>I am coming soon.<span class="fn">d</span>  Hold fast to what you have, so that no one will take your crown.
<span class="reftext">12</span>The one who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will never again leave it. Upon him I will write the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God (the new Jerusalem that comes down out of heaven from My God), and My new name.

<span class="reftext">18</span>I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, white garments so that you may be clothed and your shameful nakedness not exposed, and salve to anoint your eyes so that you may see.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Those I love, I rebuke and discipline. Therefore be earnest and repent.
</p><p class="tab1stlinered"><span class="reftext">20</span>Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him, and he with Me.
