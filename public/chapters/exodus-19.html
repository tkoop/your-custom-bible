<font ><b>Israel at Mount Sinai</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the third month, on the same day of the
month that the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, they came to
the Wilderness of Sinai. After they had set out from Rephidim, they
entered the Wilderness of Sinai, and Israel camped there in front of
the mountain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD
called to him from the mountain, “This is what you are to tell the
house of Jacob and explain to the sons of Israel: ‘You have seen
for yourselves what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’
wings and brought you to Myself. Now if you will indeed obey My voice
and keep My covenant, you will be My treasured possession out of all
the nations—for the whole earth is Mine. And unto Me you shall be a
kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you
are to speak to the Israelites.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses went back and summoned the elders
of the people and set before them all these words that the LORD had
commanded him. And all the people answered together, “We will do
everything that the LORD has spoken.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses brought their words back to the
LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will
come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear when I
speak with you, and they will always put their trust in you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Moses relayed to the LORD what the
people had said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to the
people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. They must wash their
clothes and be prepared by the third day, for on the third day the
LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you are to set up a boundary for the
people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful not to go up
on the mountain or touch its base. Whoever touches the mountain shall
surely be put to death. No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely
be stoned or shot with arrows—whether man or beast, he must not
live.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long
blast may they approach the mountain.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Moses came down from the mountain to
the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes. “Be
prepared for the third day,” he said to the people. “Do not draw
near to a woman.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the third day, when morning came, there
was thunder and lightning. A thick cloud was upon the mountain, and a
very loud blast of the ram’s horn went out, so that all the people
in the camp trembled. Then Moses brought the people out of the camp
to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in
smoke, because the LORD had descended on it in fire. And the smoke
rose like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked
violently. And as the sound of the ram’s horn grew louder and
louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in the thunder. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD descended to the top of Mount
Sinai and called Moses to the summit. So Moses went up, and the LORD
said to him, “Go down and warn the people not to break through to
see the LORD, lest many of them perish. Even the priests who approach
the LORD must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out
against them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Moses said to the LORD, “The people
cannot come up Mount Sinai, for You solemnly warned us, ‘Put a
boundary around the mountain and set it apart as holy.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD replied, “Go down and bring
Aaron with you. But the priests and the people must not break through
to come up to the LORD, or He will break out against them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses went down to the people and spoke
to them. </font>
