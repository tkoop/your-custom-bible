<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Israel at Mount Sinai</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the third month, on the same day of the month<span class="fn">a</span>  that the Israelites had left the land of Egypt, they came to the <span class='cap'>Wilderness</span><span class='nocap'>wilderness</span> of Sinai.
<span class="reftext">2</span>After they had set out from Rephidim, they entered the <span class='cap'>Wilderness</span><span class='nocap'>wilderness</span> of Sinai, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then Moses went up to God, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> called to him from the mountain, “This is what you are to tell the house of Jacob and explain to the sons of Israel:
<span class="reftext">4</span>‘You have seen for yourselves what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span>.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Now if you will indeed obey <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> voice and keep <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> covenant, you will be <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> treasured possession out of all the nations—for the whole earth is <span class='cap'>Mine</span><span class='nocap'>mine</span>.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And unto <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> you shall be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you are to speak to the Israelites.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all these words that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded him.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And all the people answered together, “We will do everything that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has spoken.” </p><p class="reg1"> So Moses brought their words back to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> said to Moses, “Behold, I will come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear when I speak with you, and they will always put their trust in you.” </p><p class="reg1"> And Moses relayed to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> what the people had said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. They must wash their clothes
<span class="reftext">11</span>and be prepared by the third day, for on the third day <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And you are to set up a boundary for the people around the mountain and tell them, ‘Be careful not to go up on the mountain or touch its base. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
<span class="reftext">13</span>No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows—whether man or beast, he must not live.’<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.<span class="fn">c</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When Moses came down from the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.
<span class="reftext">15</span>“Be prepared for the third day,” he said to the people. “Do not draw near to a woman.”
</p><p class="hdg"><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> Visits Sinai</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>On the third day, when morning came, there was thunder and lightning. A thick cloud was upon the mountain, and a very loud blast of the ram’s horn went out, so that all the people in the camp trembled.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke, because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had descended on it in fire. And the smoke rose like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently.
<span class="reftext">19</span>And as the sound of the ram’s horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in the thunder.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the summit. So Moses went up,
<span class="reftext">21</span>and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to him, “Go down and warn the people not to break through to see <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, lest many of them perish.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Even the priests who approach <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> must consecrate themselves, or <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will break out against them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But Moses said to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, for <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> solemnly warned us, ‘Put a boundary around the mountain and set it apart as holy.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> replied, “Go down and bring Aaron with you. But the priests and the people must not break through to come up to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, or <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will break out against them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">In the third month, on the same day</i>; that is, two months after leaving Egypt; see Numbers 33:3.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Cited in Hebrews 12:20<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">may they go up on the mountain</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
