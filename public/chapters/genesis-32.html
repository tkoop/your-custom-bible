<font ><b>Jacob Wrestles with God</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Jacob also went on his way, and the angels
of God met him. When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of
God.” So he named that place Mahanaim. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his
brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. He instructed
them, “You are to say to my master Esau, ‘Your servant Jacob
says: I have been staying with Laban and have remained there until
now. I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, menservants, and maidservants. I
have sent this message to inform my master, so that I may find favor
in your sight.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When the messengers returned to Jacob,
they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to
meet you—he and four hundred men with him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >In great fear and distress, Jacob divided
his people into two camps, as well as the flocks and herds and
camels. He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one camp, then the
other camp can escape.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Jacob declared, “O God of my father
Abraham, God of my father Isaac, the LORD who told me, ‘Go back to
your country and to your kindred, and I will make you prosper,’ I
am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your
servant. Indeed, with only my staff I came across the Jordan, but now
I have become two camps. Please deliver me from the hand of my
brother Esau, for I am afraid that he may come and attack me and the
mothers and children with me. But You have said, ‘I will surely
make you prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the
sea, too numerous to count.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Jacob spent the night there, and from what
he had brought with him, he selected a gift for his brother Esau: 200
female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, 30 milk camels with
their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male
donkeys. He entrusted them to his servants in separate herds and told
them, “Go on ahead of me, and keep some distance between the
herds.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >He instructed the one in the lead, “When
my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, where
are you going, and whose animals are these before you?’ then you
are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift,
sent to my lord Esau. And behold, Jacob is behind us.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >He also instructed the second, the third,
and all those following behind the herds: “When you meet Esau, you
are to say the same thing to him. You are also to say, ‘Look, your
servant Jacob is right behind us.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
For he thought, “I will appease Esau with the gift that is going
before me. After that I can face him, and perhaps he will accept me.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Jacob’s gifts went on before him,
while he spent the night in the camp. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >During the night Jacob got up and took his
two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and crossed the
ford of the Jabbok. He took them and sent them across the stream,
along with all his possessions. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Jacob was left all alone, and there a
man wrestled with him until daybreak. When the man saw that he could
not overpower Jacob, he struck the socket of Jacob’s hip and
dislocated it as they wrestled. Then the man said, “Let me go, for
it is daybreak.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But Jacob replied, “I will not let you
go unless you bless me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >What is your name?” the man asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >Jacob,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the man said, “Your name will no
longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and
with men, and you have prevailed.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And Jacob requested, “Please tell me
your name.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But he replied, “Why do you ask my
name?” Then he blessed Jacob there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So Jacob named the place Peniel, saying,
“Indeed, I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The sun rose above him as he passed by
Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip. Therefore to this day
the Israelites do not eat the tendon which is at the socket of the
hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was struck near that tendon.
