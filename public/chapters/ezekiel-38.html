<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the word of the LORD came to me,
saying, “Son of man, set your face against Gog of the land of
Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. Prophesy against him
and declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: Behold, I am against
you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. I will turn you
around, put hooks in your jaws, and bring you out with all your
army—your horses, your horsemen in full armor, and a great company
armed with shields and bucklers, all brandishing their swords.
Persia, Cush, and Put will accompany them, all with shields and
helmets, as well as Gomer with all its troops, and Beth-togarmah from
the far north with all its troops—the many nations with you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Get ready; prepare yourself, you and all
your company gathered around you; you will be their guard. After a
long time you will be summoned. In the latter years you will enter a
land that has recovered from war, whose people were gathered from
many nations to the mountains of Israel, which had long been
desolate. They had been brought out from the nations, and all now
dwell securely. You and all your troops, and many peoples with you
will go up, advancing like a thunderstorm; you will be like a cloud
covering the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what the Lord GOD says: On that
day, thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will devise an evil
plan. You will say, ‘I will go up against a land of unwalled
villages; I will come against a tranquil people who dwell securely,
all of them living without walls or bars or gates— in order to
seize the spoil and carry off the plunder, to turn a hand against the
desolate places now inhabited and against a people gathered from the
nations, who have acquired livestock and possessions and who live at
the center of the land.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of
Tarshish with all its villages will ask, ‘Have you come to capture
the plunder? Have you assembled your hordes to carry away loot, to
make off with silver and gold, to take cattle and goods, to seize
great spoil?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore prophesy, son of man, and tell
Gog that this is what the Lord GOD says: On that day when My people
Israel are dwelling securely, will you not take notice of this? And
you will come from your place out of the far north—you and many
peoples with you, all riding horses—a mighty horde, a huge army.
You will advance against My people Israel like a cloud covering the
land. It will happen in the latter days, O Gog, that I will bring you
against My land, so that the nations may know Me when I show Myself
holy in you before their eyes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This is what the Lord GOD says: Are you
the one of whom I have spoken in former days through My servants, the
prophets of Israel, who in those times prophesied for years that I
would bring you against them? Now on that day when Gog comes against
the land of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, My wrath will flare up. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In My zeal and fiery rage I proclaim that
on that day there will be a great earthquake in the land of Israel.
The fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the beasts of the field,
every creature that crawls upon the ground, and all mankind on the
face of the earth will tremble at My presence. The mountains will be
thrown down, the cliffs will collapse, and every wall will fall to
the ground. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And I will summon a sword against Gog on
all My mountains, declares the Lord GOD, and every man’s sword will
be against his brother. I will execute judgment upon him with plague
and bloodshed. I will pour out torrents of rain, hailstones, fire,
and sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him.
I will magnify and sanctify Myself, and will reveal Myself in the
sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD. </font>
