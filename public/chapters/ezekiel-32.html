<span class="reftext">2</span>“Son of man, take up a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘You are like a lion among the nations; </p><p class="indent"> you are like a monster in the seas. </p><p class="indent1"> You thrash about in your rivers, </p><p class="indent"> churning up the waters with your feet </p><p class="indent"> and muddying the streams.’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘I will spread <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> net over you </p><p class="indent"> with a company of many peoples, </p><p class="indent"> and they will draw you up in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> net.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I will abandon you on the land </p><p class="indent"> and hurl you into the open field. </p><p class="indent1"> I will cause all the birds of the air </p><p class="indent"> to settle upon you, </p><p class="indent1"> and all the beasts of the earth </p><p class="indent"> to eat their fill of you.

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>For this is what the Lord GOD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘The sword of the king of Babylon </p><p class="indent"> will come against you!

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I will slaughter all her cattle </p><p class="indent"> beside the abundant waters. </p><p class="indent1"> No human foot will muddy them again, </p><p class="indent"> and no cattle hooves will disturb them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then I will let her waters settle </p><p class="indent"> and will make her rivers flow like oil,’ </p><p class="selah"> declares the Lord GOD.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>‘When I make the land of Egypt a desolation </p><p class="indent"> and empty it of all that filled it, </p><p class="indent1"> when I strike down all who live there, </p><p class="indent"> then they will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.’
