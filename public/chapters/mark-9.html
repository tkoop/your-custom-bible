</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>After six days Jesus took with Him Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There He was transfigured before them.
<span class="reftext">3</span>His clothes became radiantly white, brighter than any launderer on earth could bleach them.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Elijah and Moses appeared before them, talking with Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters<span class="fn">a</span>—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
<span class="reftext">6</span>For they were all so terrified that Peter did not know what else to say.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is My beloved Son. Listen to Him!”
<span class="reftext">8</span>Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one with them except Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus admonished them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
<span class="reftext">10</span>So they kept this matter to themselves, discussing what it meant to rise from the dead.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And they asked Jesus, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>He replied, <span>“Elijah does indeed come first, and he restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected?
<span class="reftext">13</span>But I tell you that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they wished, just as it is written about him.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Boy with an Evil Spirit<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 17:14–18; Luke 9:37–42)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them.
<span class="reftext">15</span>As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were filled with awe and ran to greet Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">16</span>“What are you disputing with them?”</span> He asked.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Someone in the crowd replied, “Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a spirit that makes him mute.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid.<span class="fn">b</span>  I asked Your disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">19</span>“O unbelieving generation!”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“How long must I remain with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to Me.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So they brought him, and seeing Jesus, the spirit immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Jesus asked the boy’s father, <span>“How long has this been with him?”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“From childhood,” he said.
<span class="reftext">22</span>“It often throws him into the fire or into the water, trying to kill him. But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">23</span>“If You can?”</span> echoed Jesus. <span>“All things are possible to him who believes!”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Immediately the boy’s father cried out,<span class="fn">c</span>  “I do believe; help my unbelief!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>When Jesus saw that a crowd had come running, He rebuked the unclean spirit. <span>“You deaf and mute spirit,”</span> He said, <span>“I command you to come out and never enter him again.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>After shrieking and convulsing him violently, the spirit came out. The boy became like a corpse, so that many said, “He is dead.”
<span class="reftext">27</span>But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>After Jesus had gone into the house, His disciples asked Him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Jesus answered, <span>“This kind cannot come out, except by prayer.”</span><span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Second Prediction of the Passion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 17:22–23; Luke 9:43–45)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Going on from there, they passed through Galilee. But Jesus did not want anyone to know,
<span class="reftext">31</span>because He was teaching His disciples. He told them, <span>“The Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill Him, and after three days He will rise.”</span>
<span class="reftext">32</span>But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.
</p><p class="hdg">The Greatest in the Kingdom<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 18:1–5; Luke 9:46–50)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Then they came to Capernaum. While Jesus was in the house, He asked them, <span>“What were you discussing on the way?”</span>
<span class="reftext">34</span>But they were silent, for on the way they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, <span>“If anyone wants to be first, he must be the last of all and the servant of all.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Then He had a little child stand among them. Taking the child in His arms, He said to them,
<span><span class="reftext">37</span>“Whoever welcomes one of these little children in My name welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me welcomes not only Me, but the One who sent Me.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw someone else driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not accompany us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">39</span>“Do not stop him,”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“For no one who performs a miracle in My name can turn around and speak evil of Me.
<span class="reftext">40</span>For whoever is not against us is for us.
<span class="reftext">41</span>Indeed, if anyone gives you even a cup of water because you bear the name of Christ, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.</span>
