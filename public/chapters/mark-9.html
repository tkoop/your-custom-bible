<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Truly
I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death
before they see the kingdom of God arrive with power.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After six days Jesus took with Him Peter,
James, and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There
He was transfigured before them. His clothes became radiantly white,
brighter than any launderer on earth could bleach them. And Elijah
and Moses appeared before them, talking with Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good
for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for You, one
for Moses, and one for Elijah.” For they were all so terrified that
Peter did not know what else to say. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them,
and a voice came from the cloud: “This is My beloved Son. Listen to
Him!” Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one with them
except Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As they were coming down the mountain,
Jesus admonished them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the
Son of Man had risen from the dead. So they kept this matter to
themselves, discussing what it meant to rise from the dead. And they
asked Jesus, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He replied, <font color="#a80000">“Elijah
does indeed come first, and he restores all things. Why then is it
written that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected?
But I tell you that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him
whatever they wished, just as it is written about him.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When they returned to the other disciples,
they saw a large crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. As
soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were filled with awe and ran
to greet Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">What are you
disputing with them?”</font> He asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Someone in the crowd replied, “Teacher,
I brought You my son, who has a spirit that makes him mute. Whenever
it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth,
gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked Your disciples to drive
it out, but they were unable.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">O unbelieving
generation!”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“How
long must I remain with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring
the boy to Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they brought him, and seeing Jesus, the
spirit immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the
ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus asked the boy’s father, <font color="#a80000">“How
long has this been with him?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">From childhood,” he said. “It often
throws him into the fire or into the water, trying to kill him. But
if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">If You can?”</font>
echoed Jesus. <font color="#a80000">“All things are possible to him
who believes!”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Immediately the boy’s father cried out,
“I do believe; help my unbelief!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jesus saw that a crowd had come
running, He rebuked the unclean spirit. <font color="#a80000">“You
deaf and mute spirit,”</font> He said, <font color="#a80000">“I
command you to come out and never enter him again.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After shrieking and convulsing him
violently, the spirit came out. The boy became like a corpse, so that
many said, “He is dead.” But Jesus took him by the hand and
helped him to his feet, and he stood up. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After Jesus had gone into the house, His
disciples asked Him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“This
kind cannot come out, except by prayer.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Going on from there, they passed through
Galilee. But Jesus did not want anyone to know, because He was
teaching His disciples. He told them, <font color="#a80000">“The
Son of Man will be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill
Him, and after three days He will rise.”</font> But they did not
understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask Him about it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they came to Capernaum. While Jesus
was in the house, He asked them, <font color="#a80000">“What were
you discussing on the way?”</font> But they were silent, for on the
way they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and
said, <font color="#a80000">“If anyone wants to be first, he must
be the last of all and the servant of all.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then He had a little child stand among
them. Taking the child in His arms, He said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Whoever
welcomes one of these little children in My name welcomes Me, and
whoever welcomes Me welcomes not only Me, but the One who sent Me.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw
someone else driving out demons in Your name, and we tried to stop
him, because he does not accompany us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not stop him,”</font>
Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“For no one who performs a
miracle in My name can turn around and speak evil of Me. For whoever
is not against us is for us. Indeed, if anyone gives you even a cup
of water because you bear the name of Christ, truly I tell you, he
will never lose his reward.</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">But if anyone causes
one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be
better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to

your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to
