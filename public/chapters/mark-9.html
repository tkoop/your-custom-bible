</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>After six days Jesus took with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was transfigured before them.
<span class="reftext">3</span>His clothes became radiantly white, brighter than any launderer on <span class='nocap'>Earth</span><span class='cap'>Earth</span><span class='bsb'>earth</span> could bleach them.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Elijah and Moses appeared before them, talking with Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters<span class="fn">a</span>—one for <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
<span class="reftext">6</span>For they were all so terrified that Peter did not know what else to say.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> beloved <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span>. Listen to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>!”
<span class="reftext">8</span>Suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one with them except Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus admonished them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of <span class='cap'>Man</span><span class='nocap'>man</span><span class='bsb'>Man</span> had risen from the dead.
<span class="reftext">10</span>So they kept this matter to themselves, discussing what it meant to rise from the dead.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And they asked Jesus, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>He replied, <span>“Elijah does indeed come first, and he restores all things. Why then is it written that the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of <span class='cap'>Man</span><span class='nocap'>man</span><span class='bsb'>Man</span> must suffer many things and be rejected?
<span class="reftext">13</span>But I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> that Elijah has indeed come, and they have done to him whatever they wished, just as it is written about him.”</span>

<span class="reftext">15</span>As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were filled with awe and ran to greet <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">16</span>“What are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> disputing with them?”</span> He asked.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Someone in the crowd replied, “Teacher, I brought <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> my son, who has a spirit that makes him mute.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth, and becomes rigid.<span class="fn">b</span>  I asked <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> disciples to drive it out, but they were unable.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">19</span>“O unbelieving generation!”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“How long must I remain with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>? How long must I put up with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>? Bring the boy to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So they brought him, and seeing Jesus, the spirit immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Jesus asked the boy’s father, <span>“How long has this been with him?”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“From childhood,” he said.
<span class="reftext">22</span>“It often throws him into the fire or into the water, trying to kill him. But if <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">23</span>“If <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> can?”</span> echoed Jesus. <span>“All things are possible to him who believes!”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Immediately the boy’s father cried out,<span class="fn">c</span>  “I do believe; help my unbelief!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>When Jesus saw that a crowd had come running, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> rebuked the unclean spirit. <span>“You deaf and mute spirit,”</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said, <span>“I command you to come out and never enter him again.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>After shrieking and convulsing him violently, the spirit came out. The boy became like a corpse, so that many said, “He is dead.”
<span class="reftext">27</span>But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>After Jesus had gone into the house, <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Jesus answered, <span>“This kind cannot come out, except by prayer.”</span><span class="fn">d</span>

<span class="reftext">32</span>But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> about it.

<span class="reftext">34</span>But they were silent, for on the way they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.

</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">39</span>“Do not stop him,”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“For no one who performs a miracle in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> name can turn around and speak evil of <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>.
