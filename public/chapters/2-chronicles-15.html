<font ><b>The Prophecy of Azariah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Spirit of God came upon Azariah
son of Oded. So he went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Listen to
me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is with you when you are
with Him. If you seek Him, He will be found by you, but if you
forsake Him, He will forsake you. For many years Israel has been
without the true God, without a priest to instruct them, and without
the law. But in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of
Israel, and sought Him, and He was found by them. In those days there
was no safety for travelers, because the residents of the lands had
many conflicts. Nation was crushed by nation, and city by city, for
God afflicted them with all kinds of adversity. But as for you, be
strong; do not be discouraged, for your work will be rewarded.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Asa heard these words and the
prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he took courage and
removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and
Benjamin and from the cities he had captured in the hill country of
Ephraim. He then restored the altar of the LORD that was in front of
the portico of the LORD’s temple. And he assembled all Judah and
Benjamin, along with those from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and
Simeon who had settled among them, for great numbers had come over to
him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they gathered together in Jerusalem in
the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign. At that time
they sacrificed to the LORD seven hundred oxen and seven thousand
sheep from all the plunder they had brought back. Then they entered
into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all
their heart and soul. And whoever would not seek the LORD, the God of
Israel, would be put to death, whether young or old, man or woman.
They took an oath to the LORD with a loud voice, with shouting,
trumpets, and rams’ horns. And all Judah rejoiced over the oath,
for they had sworn it with all their heart. They had sought Him
earnestly, and He was found by them. So the LORD gave them rest on
every side. </font>

<font >King Asa also removed his grandmother
Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made a
detestable Asherah pole. Asa chopped down the pole, crushed it, and
burned it in the Kidron Valley. The high places were not removed from
Israel, but Asa’s heart was fully devoted all his days. And he
brought into the house of God the silver and gold articles that he
and his father had dedicated. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And there was no war until the
thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign. </font>
