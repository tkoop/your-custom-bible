<font ><b>Paul in Macedonia and Greece</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for
the disciples. And after encouraging them, he said goodbye to them
and left for Macedonia. After traveling through that area and
speaking many words of encouragement, he arrived in Greece, where he
stayed three months. And when the Jews formed a plot against him as
he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through
Macedonia. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Paul was accompanied by Sopater son of
Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius
from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of
Asia. These men went on ahead and waited for us in Troas. And after
the Feast of Unleavened Bread, we sailed from Philippi, and five days
later we rejoined them in Troas, where we stayed seven days. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the first day of the week we came
together to break bread. Since Paul was ready to leave the next day,
he talked to them and kept on speaking until midnight. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now there were many lamps in the upper
room where we were gathered. And a certain young man named Eutychus,
seated in the window, was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on
and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell from the third story and
was picked up dead. But Paul went down, threw himself on the young
man, and embraced him. “Do not be alarmed!” he said. “He is
still alive!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Paul went back upstairs, broke bread,
and ate. And after speaking until daybreak, he departed. And the
people were greatly relieved to take the boy home alive. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We went on ahead to the ship and sailed to
Assos, where we were to take Paul aboard. He had arranged this
because he was going there on foot. And when he met us at Assos, we
took him aboard and went on to Mitylene. Sailing on from there, we
arrived the next day opposite Chios. The day after that we arrived at
Samos, and on the following day we came to Miletus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to
avoid spending time in the province of Asia, because he was in a
hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the
elders of the church. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they came to him, he said, “You
know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I
arrived in the province of Asia. I served the Lord with great
humility and with tears, especially in the trials that came upon me
through the plots of the Jews. I did not shrink back from declaring
anything that was helpful to you as I taught you publicly and from
house to house, testifying to Jews and Greeks alike about repentance
to God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am
going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there. I only
know that in town after town the Holy Spirit warns me that chains and
afflictions await me. But I consider my life of no value to me, if
only I may finish my course and complete the ministry I have received
from the Lord Jesus—the ministry of testifying to the good news of
God’s grace. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now I know that none of you among whom I
have preached the kingdom will see my face again. Therefore I testify
to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men. For I did
not shrink back from declaring to you the whole will of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Keep watch over yourselves and the entire
flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds
of the church of God, which He purchased with His own blood. I know
that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you and
will not spare the flock. Even from your own number, men will rise up
and distort the truth to draw away disciples after them. Therefore be
alert and remember that for three years I never stopped warning each
of you night and day with tears. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now I commit you to God and to the
word of His grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance
among all who are sanctified. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I have not coveted anyone’s silver or
gold or clothing. You yourselves know that these hands of mine have
ministered to my own needs and those of my companions. In everything,
I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak,
remembering the words of the Lord Jesus Himself: <font color="#a80000">‘It
is more blessed to give than to receive.’</font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Paul had said this, he knelt down
with all of them and prayed. They all wept openly as they embraced
Paul and kissed him. They were especially grieved by his statement
that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him
to the ship. </font>
