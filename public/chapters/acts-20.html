<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Paul in Macedonia and Greece</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples. And after encouraging them, he said goodbye to them and left for Macedonia.
<span class="reftext">2</span>After <span class='spell ca'>travelling</span><span class='spell gb'>travelling</span><span class='spell us'>traveling</span> through that area and speaking many words of encouragement, he arrived in Greece,
<span class="reftext">3</span>where he stayed three months. And when the Jews formed a plot against him as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Paul was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">5</span>These men went on ahead and waited for us in Troas.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And after the <span class='cap'>Feast</span><span class='nocap'>feast</span> of <span class='cap'>Unleavened</span><span class='nocap'>unleavened</span> <span class='cap'>Bread</span><span class='nocap'>bread</span>,<span class="fn">b</span>  we sailed from Philippi, and five days later we rejoined them in Troas, where we stayed seven days.
</p><p class="hdg">Eutychus Revived at Troas<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 4:18–37)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Since Paul was ready to leave the next day, he talked to them and kept on speaking until midnight.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Now there were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And a certain young man named Eutychus, seated in the window, was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell from the <span class='spell ca'>third storey</span><span class='spell gb'>third storey</span><span class='spell us'>third story</span> and was picked up dead.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But Paul went down, threw himself on the young man, and embraced him. “Do not be alarmed!” he said. “He is still alive!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then Paul went back upstairs, broke bread, and ate. And after speaking until daybreak, he departed.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And the people were greatly relieved to take the boy home alive.
</p><p class="hdg">From Troas to Miletus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>We went on ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, where we were to take Paul aboard. He had arranged this because he was going there on foot.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And when he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Sailing on from there, we arrived the next day opposite Chios. The day after that we arrived at Samos, and<span class="fn">c</span>  on the following day we came to Miletus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, because he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Farewell to the Ephesians</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>When they came to him, he said, “You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I arrived in the province of Asia.
<span class="reftext">19</span>I served the Lord with great humility and with tears, especially in the trials that came upon me through the plots of the Jews.
<span class="reftext">20</span>I did not shrink back from declaring anything that was helpful to you as I taught you publicly and from house to house,
<span class="reftext">21</span>testifying to Jews and Greeks alike about repentance to God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And now, compelled by the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.
<span class="reftext">23</span>I only know that in town after town the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> warns me that chains and afflictions await me.
<span class="reftext">24</span>But I consider my life of no value to me, if only I may finish my course and complete the ministry I have received from the Lord Jesus—the ministry of testifying to the good news of God’s grace.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Now I know that none of you among whom I have preached the kingdom will see my face again.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men.<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">27</span>For I did not shrink back from declaring to you the whole will of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Keep watch over yourselves and the entire flock of which the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God,<span class="fn">g</span>  which <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> purchased with <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own blood.<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">29</span>I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Even from your own number, men will rise up and distort the truth to draw away disciples after them.
<span class="reftext">31</span>Therefore be alert and remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>And now I commit you to God and to the word of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>I have not coveted anyone’s silver or gold or clothing.
<span class="reftext">34</span>You yourselves know that these hands of mine have ministered to my own needs and those of my companions.
<span class="reftext">35</span>In everything, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words of the Lord Jesus <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span>: <span>‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>When Paul had said this, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.
<span class="reftext">37</span>They all wept openly as they embraced Paul and kissed him.
<span class="reftext">38</span>They were especially grieved by his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">from Asia</i>; Asia was a Roman province in what is now western Turkey; also in verses 16 and 18.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">after the days of the Unleavened</i>; see Exodus 12:14–20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">and, after remaining at Trogyllium,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> That is, Shavuot, the late spring feast of pilgrimage to Jerusalem; it is also known as <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Harvest</i> (see Exodus 23:16) or <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Weeks</i> (see Exodus 34:22).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> ECM, TR, and Tischendorf; NA, SBL, NE, BYZ, and WH <i class="calibre6">our Lord Jesus</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> See Ezekiel 33:8–9.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Tischendorf <i class="calibre6">of the Lord</i>; BYZ and GOC <i class="calibre6">of the Lord and God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">with the blood of His own Son.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
