<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Death of Moses</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which faces Jericho. And the LORD showed him the whole land—from Gilead as far as Dan,
<span class="reftext">2</span>all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">3</span>the Negev, and the region from the Valley of Jericho (the City of Palms) all the way to Zoar.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And the LORD said to him, “This is the land that I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your own eyes, but you will not cross into it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, as the LORD had said.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And He buried him<span class="fn">b</span>  in a valley in the land of Moab facing Beth-peor, and no one to this day knows the location of his grave.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak, and his vitality had not diminished.
<span class="reftext">8</span>The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning for Moses came to an end.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites obeyed him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Since that time, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face—
<span class="reftext">11</span>no prophet who did all the signs and wonders that the LORD sent Moses to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his officials and all his land,
<span class="reftext">12</span>and no prophet who performed all the mighty acts of power and awesome deeds<span class="fn">c</span>  that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the Mediterranean Sea, also called the Great Sea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> SP and some LXX manuscripts <i class="calibre6">they buried him</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">terrifying deeds</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
