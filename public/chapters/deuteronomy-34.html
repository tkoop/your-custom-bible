<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab
to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which faces Jericho. And the
LORD showed him the whole land—from Gilead as far as Dan, all of
Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as
far as the Western Sea, the Negev, and the region from the Valley of
Jericho (the City of Palms) all the way to Zoar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD said to him, “This is the
land that I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, ‘I
will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your
own eyes, but you will not cross into it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Moses the servant of the LORD died
there in the land of Moab, as the LORD had said. And He buried him in
a valley in the land of Moab facing Beth-peor, and no one to this day
knows the location of his grave. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moses was a hundred and twenty years old
when he died, yet his eyes were not weak, and his vitality had not
diminished. The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab
thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning for Moses came to
an end. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the
spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the
Israelites obeyed him and did as the LORD had commanded Moses. Since
that time, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD
knew face to face— no prophet who did all the signs and wonders
that the LORD sent Moses to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to
all his officials and all his land, and no prophet who performed all
the mighty acts of power and awesome deeds that Moses did in the
sight of all Israel. </font>
