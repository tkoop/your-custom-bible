</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Cursing and lying, </p><p class="indent"> murder and stealing, </p><p class="indent1"> and adultery are rampant; </p><p class="indent"> one act of bloodshed follows another.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore the land mourns, </p><p class="indent"> and all who dwell in it will waste away </p><p class="indent1"> with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air; </p><p class="indent"> even the fish of the sea disappear.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>But let no man contend; </p><p class="indent"> let no man offer reproof; </p><p class="indent1"> for your people are like those </p><p class="indent"> who contend with a priest.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>You will stumble by day, </p><p class="indent"> and the prophet will stumble with you by night; </p><p class="indent"> so I will destroy your mother—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>My people are destroyed </p><p class="indent"> for lack of knowledge. </p><p class="indent1"> Because you have rejected knowledge, </p><p class="indent"> I will also reject you as My priests. </p><p class="indent1"> Since you have forgotten the law of your God, </p><p class="indent"> I will also forget your children.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>The more they multiplied, </p><p class="indent"> the more they sinned against Me; </p><p class="indent1"> they exchanged their Glory<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> for a thing of disgrace.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>They will eat but not be satisfied; </p><p class="indent"> they will be promiscuous but not multiply. </p><p class="indent"> For they have stopped obeying <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
