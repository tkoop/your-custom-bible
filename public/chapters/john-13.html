Having loved <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own who were in the world, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> loved them to the very end.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">2</span>The evening meal was underway, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Jesus knew that the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> had delivered all things into <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hands, and that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had come from God and was returning to God.
<span class="reftext">4</span>So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> got up from the supper, laid aside <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> outer garments, and wrapped a towel around <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> waist.
<span class="reftext">5</span>After that, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and dry them with the towel that was around <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>He came to Simon Peter, who asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Lord, are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> going to wash my feet?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Jesus replied, <span>“You do not <span class='spell ca'>realize</span><span class='spell gb'>realise</span><span class='spell us'>realize</span> now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>“Never shall <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> wash my feet!” Peter told <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. </p><p class="reg1"> Jesus answered, <span>“Unless I wash you, you have no part with <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not only my feet, but my hands and my head as well!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Jesus told him, <span>“Whoever has already bathed needs only to wash his feet, and he will be completely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.”</span>
<span class="reftext">11</span>For <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> knew who would betray <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. That is why <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said, <span>“Not all of you are clean.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>When Jesus had washed their feet and put on <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> outer garments, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> reclined with them again and asked, <span>“Do you know what I have done for you?
<span class="reftext">13</span>You call <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> <span class='cap'>Teacher</span><span class='nocap'>teacher</span> and Lord, and rightly so, because I am.
<span class="reftext">14</span>So if I, your Lord and <span class='cap'>Teacher</span><span class='nocap'>teacher</span>, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet.
<span class="reftext">15</span>I have set you an example so that you should do as I have done for you.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Truly, truly, I tell you, no servant is greater than his master,<span class="fn">b</span>  nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.
<span class="reftext">17</span>If you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.</span>

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>After Jesus had said this, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> became troubled in spirit and testified, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, one of you will betray <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>The disciples looked at one another, perplexed as to which of them <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> meant.
<span class="reftext">23</span>One of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> side.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">24</span>So Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus which one <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was talking about.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Leaning back against Jesus, he asked, “Lord, who is it?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Jesus answered, <span>“It is the one to whom I give this morsel after I have dipped it.”</span> Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> dipped the morsel and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot.
<span class="reftext">27</span>And when Judas had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. </p><p class="reg1"> Then Jesus said to Judas, <span>“What you are about to do, do quickly.”</span>
<span class="reftext">28</span>But no one at the table knew why Jesus had said this to him.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Since Judas kept the money bag, some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor.
<span class="reftext">30</span>As soon as he had received the morsel, Judas went out into the night.
