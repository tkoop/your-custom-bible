<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">It was now just before the Passover Feast,
and Jesus knew that His hour had come to leave this world and return
to the Father. Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved
them to the very end. The evening meal was underway, and the devil
had already put into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot,
to betray Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus knew that the Father had delivered
all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was
returning to God. So He got up from the supper, laid aside His outer
garments, and wrapped a towel around His waist. After that, He poured
water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and dry
them with the towel that was around Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He came to Simon Peter, who asked Him,
“Lord, are You going to wash my feet?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“You
do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Never shall You wash my feet!” Peter
told Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“Unless
I wash you, you have no part with Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied,
“not only my feet, but my hands and my head as well!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus told him, <font color="#a80000">“Whoever
has already bathed needs only to wash his feet, and he will be
completely clean. And you are clean, though not all of you.”</font>
For He knew who would betray Him. That is why He said, <font color="#a80000">“Not
all of you are clean.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jesus had washed their feet and put
on His outer garments, He reclined with them again and asked, <font color="#a80000">“Do
you know what I have done for you? You call Me Teacher and Lord, and
rightly so, because I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed
your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. I have set you
an example so that you should do as I have done for you. Truly,
truly, I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a
messenger greater than the one who sent him. If you know these
things, you will be blessed if you do them.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">I am not speaking
about all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfill
the Scripture: ‘The one who shares My bread has lifted up his heel
against Me.’ I am telling you now before it happens, so that when
it comes to pass, you will believe that I am He. Truly, truly, I tell
you, whoever receives the one I send receives Me, and whoever
receives Me receives the One who sent Me.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After Jesus had said this, He became
troubled in spirit and testified, <font color="#a80000">“Truly,
truly, I tell you, one of you will betray Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The disciples looked at one another,
perplexed as to which of them He meant. One of His disciples, the one
whom Jesus loved, was reclining at His side. So Simon Peter motioned
to him to ask Jesus which one He was talking about. Leaning back
against Jesus, he asked, “Lord, who is it?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“It
is the one to whom I give this morsel after I have dipped it.”</font>
Then He dipped the morsel and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot.
And when Judas had taken the morsel, Satan entered into him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus said to Judas, <font color="#a80000">“What
you are about to do, do quickly.”</font> But no one at the table
knew why Jesus had said this to him. Since Judas kept the money bag,
some thought that Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for
the feast, or to give something to the poor. As soon as he had
received the morsel, Judas went out into the night. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Judas had gone out, Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“Now
the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is
glorified in Him, God will also glorify the Son in Himself—and will
glorify Him at once.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Little children, I
am with you only a little while longer. You will look for Me, and as
I said to the Jews, so now I say to you: ‘Where I am going, you
cannot come.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">A new commandment I
give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you also must
love one another. By this everyone will know that you are My
disciples, if you love one another.” </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Lord, where are You going?” Simon
Peter asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“Where

<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Will you lay down

truly, I tell you, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three
times.</font> </font>
