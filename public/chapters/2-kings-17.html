Kings 17</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Hoshea the Last King of Israel</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the twelfth year of the reign of Ahaz
over Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel, and he reigned
in Samaria nine years. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, but
not like the kings of Israel who preceded him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Shalmaneser king of Assyria attacked him,
and Hoshea became his vassal and paid him tribute. But the king of
Assyria discovered that Hoshea had conspired to send envoys to King
So of Egypt, and that he had not paid tribute to the king of Assyria
as in previous years. Therefore the king of Assyria arrested Hoshea
and put him in prison. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole
land, marched up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of
Assyria captured Samaria and carried away the Israelites to Assyria,
where he settled them in Halah, in Gozan by the Habor River, and in
the cities of the Medes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">All this happened because the people of
Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them
out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of
Egypt. They had worshiped other gods and walked in the customs of the
nations that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites, as well
as in the practices introduced by the kings of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Israelites secretly did things against
the LORD their God that were not right. From watchtower to fortified
city, they built high places in all their cities. They set up for
themselves sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and
under every green tree. They burned incense on all the high places
like the nations that the LORD had driven out before them. They did
wicked things, provoking the LORD to anger. They served idols,
although the LORD had told them, “You shall not do this thing.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Yet through all His prophets and seers,
the LORD warned Israel and Judah, saying, “Turn from your wicked
ways and keep My commandments and statutes, according to the entire
Law that I commanded your fathers and delivered to you through My
servants the prophets.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But they would not listen, and they
stiffened their necks like their fathers, who did not believe the
LORD their God. They rejected His statutes and the covenant He had
made with their fathers, as well as the decrees He had given them.
They pursued worthless idols and themselves became worthless, going
after the surrounding nations that the LORD had commanded them not to
imitate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They abandoned all the commandments of the
LORD their God and made for themselves two cast idols of calves and
an Asherah pole. They bowed down to all the host of heaven and served
Baal. They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire and
practiced divination and soothsaying. They devoted themselves to
doing evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the LORD was very angry with Israel,
and He removed them from His presence. Only the tribe of Judah
remained, and even Judah did not keep the commandments of the LORD
their God, but lived according to the customs Israel had introduced.
So the LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel. He afflicted them
and delivered them into the hands of plunderers, until He had
banished them from His presence. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the LORD had torn Israel away from
the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat king, and
Jeroboam led Israel away from following the LORD and caused them to
commit a great sin. The Israelites persisted in all the sins that
Jeroboam had committed and did not turn away from them. Finally, the
LORD removed Israel from His presence, as He had declared through all
His servants the prophets. So Israel was exiled from their homeland
into Assyria, where they are to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king of Assyria brought people
from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them
in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. They took
possession of Samaria and lived in its towns. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when the settlers first lived there,
they did not worship the LORD, so He sent lions among them, which
killed some of them. So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying,
“The peoples that you have removed and placed in the cities of
Samaria do not know the requirements of the God of the land. Because
of this, He has sent lions among them, which are indeed killing them
off.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king of Assyria commanded: “Send
back one of the priests you carried off from Samaria, and have him go
back to live there and teach the requirements of the God of the
land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Thus one of the priests they had carried
away came and lived in Bethel, and he began to teach them how they
should worship the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nevertheless, the people of each nation
continued to make their own gods in the cities where they had
settled, and they set them up in the shrines that the people of
Samaria had made on the high places. The men of Babylon made
Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made
Ashima, the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites
burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the
gods of Sepharvaim. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the new residents worshiped the LORD,
but they also appointed for themselves priests of all sorts to serve
in the shrines of the high places. They worshiped the LORD, but they
also served their own gods according to the customs of the nations
from which they had been carried away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">To this day they are still practicing
their former customs. None of them worship the LORD or observe the
statutes, ordinances, laws, and commandments that the LORD gave the
descendants of Jacob, whom He named Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the LORD had made a covenant with the
Israelites and commanded them, “Do not worship other gods or bow
down to them; do not serve them or sacrifice to them. Instead,
worship the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great
power and an outstretched arm. You are to bow down to Him and offer
sacrifices to Him. And you must always be careful to observe the
statutes, ordinances, laws, and commandments He wrote for you. Do not
worship other gods. Do not forget the covenant I have made with you.
Do not worship other gods, but worship the LORD your God, and He will
deliver you from the hands of all your enemies.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But they would not listen, and they
persisted in their former customs. So these nations worshiped the
LORD but also served their idols, and to this day their children and
grandchildren continue to do as their fathers did. </font>
