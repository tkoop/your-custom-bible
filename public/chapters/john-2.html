<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Wedding at Cana</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there,
<span class="reftext">2</span>and Jesus and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples had also been invited to the wedding.
<span class="reftext">3</span>When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “They have no more wine.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">4</span>“Woman, why does this concern us?”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“My hour has not yet come.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> tells you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Now six stone water jars had been set there for the Jewish rites of purification. Each could hold from twenty to thirty gallons.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Jesus told the servants, <span>“Fill the jars with water.”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> So they filled them to the brim.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">8</span>“Now draw some out,”</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said, <span>“and take it to the master of the banquet.”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> They did so,
<span class="reftext">9</span>and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not know where it was from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside
<span class="reftext">10</span>and said, “Everyone serves the fine wine first, and then the cheap wine after the guests are drunk. But you have saved the fine wine until now!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Jesus performed this, the first of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> signs, at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> glory, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples believed in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Cleanses the Temple<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 21:12–17; Mark 11:15–19; Luke 19:45–48)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>After this, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> went down to Capernaum with <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> mother and brothers and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples, and they stayed there a few days.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>When the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">14</span>In the temple courts<span class="fn">b</span>  <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> found men selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and money changers seated at their tables.
<span class="reftext">15</span>So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle. He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
<span class="reftext">16</span>To those selling doves <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said, <span>“Get these out of here! How dare you turn <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>’s house into a marketplace!”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> house will consume <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>On account of this, the Jews demanded, “What sign can <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> show us to prove <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> authority to do these things?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Jesus answered, <span>“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>“This temple took forty-six years to build,” the Jews replied, “and <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> are going to raise it up in three days?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>But Jesus was speaking about the temple of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> body.
<span class="reftext">22</span>After <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was raised from the dead, <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples remembered that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had said this. Then they believed the <span class='cap'>Scripture</span><span class='nocap'>scripture</span> and the word that Jesus had spoken.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>While <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was in Jerusalem at the Passover <span class='cap'>Feast</span><span class='nocap'>feast</span>, many people saw the signs <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was doing and believed in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> name.
<span class="reftext">24</span>But Jesus did not entrust <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> to them, for <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> knew them all.
<span class="reftext">25</span>He did not need any testimony about man, for <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> knew what was in a man.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">two or three metretae</i>; that is, approximately 20.8 to 31.2 gallons (78.8 to 118.1 liters)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i>; also in verse 15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Psalm 69:9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
