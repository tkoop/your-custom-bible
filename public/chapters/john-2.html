<font ><b>The Wedding at Cana</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the third day a wedding took place at
Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, and Jesus and His
disciples had also been invited to the wedding. When the wine ran
out, Jesus’ mother said to Him, “They have no more wine.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Woman, why does
this concern us?”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“My
hour has not yet come.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >His mother said to the servants, “Do
whatever He tells you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now six stone water jars had been set
there for the Jewish rites of purification. Each could hold from
twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus told the servants, <font color="#a80000">“Fill
the jars with water.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they filled them to the brim. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Now draw some
out,”</font> He said, <font color="#a80000">“and take it to the
master of the banquet.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They did so, and the master of the banquet
tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not know
where it was from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew.
Then he called the bridegroom aside and said, “Everyone serves the
fine wine first, and then the cheap wine after the guests are drunk.
But you have saved the fine wine until now!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus performed this, the first of His
signs, at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed His glory, and His
disciples believed in Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After this, He went down to Capernaum with
His mother and brothers and His disciples, and they stayed there a
few days. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus
went up to Jerusalem. In the temple courts He found men selling
cattle, sheep, and doves, and money changers seated at their tables.
So He made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts,
both sheep and cattle. He poured out the coins of the money changers
and overturned their tables. To those selling doves He said, <font color="#a80000">“Get
these out of here! How dare you turn My Father’s house into a
marketplace!”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >His disciples remembered that it is
written: “Zeal for Your house will consume Me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On account of this, the Jews demanded,
“What sign can You show us to prove Your authority to do these
things?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >This temple took forty-six years to
build,” the Jews replied, “and You are going to raise it up in
three days?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus was speaking about the temple of
His body. After He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered
that He had said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word
that Jesus had spoken. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While He was in Jerusalem at the Passover
Feast, many people saw the signs He was doing and believed in His
name. But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew them
all. He did not need any testimony about man, for He knew what was in
a man. </font>
