</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, beside which stood those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name. They were holding harps from God,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and they sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of the Lamb: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Great and wonderful are Your works, </p><p class="indent"> O Lord God Almighty! </p><p class="indent1"> Just and true are Your ways, </p><p class="indent"> O King of the nations!<span class="fn">a</span>

<span class="reftext">6</span>And out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, dressed in clean and bright linen and girded with golden sashes around their chests.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> SBL and WH <i class="calibre6">King of the ages</i>; TR <i class="calibre6">King of the saints</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
