They encamped outside the city and built<span class="fn">a</span>  a siege wall all around it.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And the city was kept under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>By the ninth day of the fourth month,<span class="fn">b</span>  the famine in the city was so severe that the people of the land had no food.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then the city was breached; and though the Chaldeans<span class="fn">c</span>  had surrounded the city, all the men of war fled by night by way of the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden. </p><p class="reg1"> They headed toward the Arabah,<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">5</span>but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was separated from him.
<span class="reftext">6</span>The Chaldeans seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they pronounced judgment on him.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And they slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. Then they put out his eyes, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon.
</p><p class="hdg">The Temple Destroyed<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jeremiah 52:12–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign over Babylon, Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">9</span>He burned down the house of the LORD, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem—every significant building.
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the whole army of the Chaldeans under the captain of the guard broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then Nebuzaradan captain of the guard carried into exile the people who remained in the city, along with the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon and the rest of the population.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But the captain of the guard left behind some of the poorest of the land to tend the vineyards and fields.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Moreover, the Chaldeans broke up the bronze pillars and stands and the bronze Sea in the house of the LORD, and they carried the bronze to Babylon.
<span class="reftext">14</span>They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the articles of bronze used in the temple service.
<span class="reftext">15</span>The captain of the guard also took away the censers and sprinkling bowls—anything made of pure gold or fine silver.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>As for the two pillars, the Sea, and the movable stands that Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the weight of the bronze from all these articles was beyond measure.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Each pillar was eighteen cubits tall.<span class="fn">e</span>  The bronze capital atop one pillar was three cubits high,<span class="fn">f</span>  with a network of bronze pomegranates all around. The second pillar, with its network, was similar.
</p><p class="hdg">Captives Carried to Babylon<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jeremiah 52:24–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>The captain of the guard also took away Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of second rank, and the three doorkeepers.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Of those still in the city, he took a court official who had been appointed over the men of war, as well as five royal advisors. He also took the scribe of the captain of the army, who had enlisted the people of the land, and sixty men who were found in the city.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
<span class="reftext">21</span>There at Riblah in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death. So Judah was taken into exile, away from its own land.
</p><p class="hdg">Gedaliah Governs in Judah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jeremiah 40:1–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over the people he had left behind in the land of Judah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When all the commanders of the armies and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah<span class="fn">g</span>  son of the Maacathite, as well as their men.
<span class="reftext">24</span>And Gedaliah took an oath before them and their men, assuring them, “Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Murder of Gedaliah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jeremiah 41:1–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family, came with ten men and struck down and killed Gedaliah, along with the Judeans and Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Then all the people small and great, together with the commanders of the army, arose and fled to Egypt for fear of the Chaldeans.
</p><p class="hdg">Jehoiachin Released from Prison<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Jeremiah 52:31–34)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, in the year Evil-merodach became king of Babylon, he released<span class="fn">h</span>  King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison.
<span class="reftext">28</span>And he spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>So Jehoiachin changed out of his prison clothes, and he dined regularly at the king’s table for the rest of his life.
<span class="reftext">30</span>And the king provided Jehoiachin a daily portion for the rest of his life.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">He encamped outside it and they built</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Probable reading (see Jeremiah 52:6); MT does not include <i class="calibre6">fourth</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, the Babylonians; also in verses 5, 6, 10, 13, 24, 25, and 26 <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Jordan Valley</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">18 cubits</i> is approximately 27 feet or 8.2 meters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> <i class="calibre6">3 cubits</i> is approximately 4.5 feet or 1.4 meters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">Jaazaniah</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jezaniah</i>; see Jeremiah 40:8.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">lifted up the head of</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
