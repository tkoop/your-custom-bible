<font ><b>Nebuchadnezzar Besieges Jerusalem</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s
reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his entire army. They encamped
outside the city and built a siege wall all around it. And the city
was kept under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >By the ninth day of the fourth month, the
famine in the city was so severe that the people of the land had no
food. Then the city was breached; and though the Chaldeans had
surrounded the city, all the men of war fled by night by way of the
gate between the two walls near the king’s garden. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They headed toward the Arabah, but the
army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains
of Jericho, and all his army was separated from him. The Chaldeans
seized the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah,
where they pronounced judgment on him. And they slaughtered the sons
of Zedekiah before his eyes. Then they put out his eyes, bound him
with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the seventh day of the fifth month, in
the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign over Babylon,
Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon,
entered Jerusalem. He burned down the house of the LORD, the royal
palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem—every significant building.
And the whole army of the Chaldeans under the captain of the guard
broke down the walls around Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Nebuzaradan captain of the guard
carried into exile the people who remained in the city, along with
the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon and the rest of
the population. But the captain of the guard left behind some of the
poorest of the land to tend the vineyards and fields. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, the Chaldeans broke up the
bronze pillars and stands and the bronze Sea in the house of the
LORD, and they carried the bronze to Babylon. They also took away the
pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the articles of bronze
used in the temple service. The captain of the guard also took away
the censers and sprinkling bowls—anything made of pure gold or fine
silver. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the two pillars, the Sea, and the
movable stands that Solomon had made for the house of the LORD, the
weight of the bronze from all these articles was beyond measure. Each
pillar was eighteen cubits tall. The bronze capital atop one pillar
was three cubits high, with a network of bronze pomegranates all
around. The second pillar, with its network, was similar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The captain of the guard also took away
Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of second rank, and
the three doorkeepers. Of those still in the city, he took a court
official who had been appointed over the men of war, as well as five
royal advisors. He also took the scribe of the captain of the army,
who had enlisted the people of the land, and sixty men who were found
in the city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took them
and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. There at Riblah in
the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon struck them down and put them
to death. So Judah was taken into exile, away from its own land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed
Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over the people he had
left behind in the land of Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When all the commanders of the armies and
their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as
governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah,
Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and
Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite, as well as their men. And Gedaliah
took an oath before them and their men, assuring them, “Do not be
afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve
the king of Babylon, and it will be well with you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son
of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was a member of the royal
family, came with ten men and struck down and killed Gedaliah, along
with the Judeans and Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. Then all
the people small and great, together with the commanders of the army,
arose and fled to Egypt for fear of the Chaldeans. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth
month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah’s King
Jehoiachin, in the year Evil-merodach became king of Babylon, he
released King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison. And he spoke kindly to
Jehoiachin and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings
who were with him in Babylon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jehoiachin changed out of his prison
clothes, and he dined regularly at the king’s table for the rest of
his life. And the king provided Jehoiachin a daily portion for the
rest of his life. </font>
