<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Call to Rebuild the Temple<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Ezra 5:1–5)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the second year of the reign of Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak,<span class="fn">a</span>  the high priest, stating
<span class="reftext">2</span>that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“These people say, ‘The time has not yet come </p><p class="indent"> to rebuild the house of the LORD.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then the word of the LORD came through Haggai the prophet, saying:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>“Is it a time for you yourselves </p><p class="indent"> to live in your <span class='spell ca'>panelled</span><span class='spell gb'>panelled</span><span class='spell us'>paneled</span> houses, </p><p class="indent"> while this house lies in ruins?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now this is what the LORD of Hosts says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Consider carefully your ways.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>You have planted much </p><p class="indent"> but harvested little. </p><p class="indent1"> You eat but never have enough. </p><p class="indent"> You drink but never have your fill. </p><p class="indent1"> You put on clothes but never get warm. </p><p class="indent"> You earn wages to put into a bag pierced through.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>This is what the LORD of Hosts says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Consider carefully your ways.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Go up into the hills, </p><p class="indent"> bring down lumber, and build the house, </p><p class="indent1"> so that I may take pleasure in it and be glorified, </p><p class="indent"> says the LORD.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>You expected much, </p><p class="indent"> but behold, it amounted to little. </p><p class="indent1"> And what you brought home, I blew away. </p><p class="indent"> Why? declares the LORD of Hosts. </p><p class="indent1"> Because My house still lies in ruins, </p><p class="indent"> while each of you is busy </p><p class="indent"> with his own house.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore, on account of you </p><p class="indent"> the heavens have withheld their dew </p><p class="indent"> and the earth has withheld its crops.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>I have summoned a drought </p><p class="indent"> on the fields and on the mountains, </p><p class="indent1"> on the grain, new wine, and oil, </p><p class="indent"> and on whatever the ground yields, </p><p class="indent1"> on man and beast, </p><p class="indent"> and on all the <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> of your hands.”
</p><p class="hdg">The People Obey</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, as well as all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of the prophet Haggai, because the LORD their God had sent him. So the people feared the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, delivered the message of the LORD to the people: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I am with you,” </p><p class="indent"> declares the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So the LORD stirred the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, as well as the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and began the work on the house of the LORD of Hosts, their God,
