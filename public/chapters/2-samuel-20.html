<font ><b>Sheba’s Rebellion</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now a worthless man named Sheba son of
Bichri, a Benjamite, happened to be there, and he blew the ram’s
horn and shouted: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >We have no share in David, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >no inheritance in Jesse’s son. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Every man to his tent, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >O Israel!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So all the men of Israel deserted David to
follow Sheba son of Bichri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king
all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When David returned to his palace in
Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to care for the
palace, and he placed them in a house under guard. He provided for
them, but he no longer slept with them. They were confined until the
day of their death, living as widows. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king said to Amasa, “Summon the
men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Amasa went to summon Judah, but he took
longer than the time allotted him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba
the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom. Take your lord’s
servants and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and elude
us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Joab’s men, along with the
Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men, marched out of
Jerusalem in pursuit of Sheba son of Bichri. And while they were at
the great stone in Gibeon, Amasa joined them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Joab was dressed in military attire,
with a dagger strapped to his belt. And as he stepped forward, he
slipped the dagger from its sheath. “Are you well, my brother?”
Joab asked Amasa. And with his right hand Joab grabbed Amasa by the
beard to kiss him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Amasa was not on guard against the dagger
in Joab’s hand, and Joab stabbed him in the stomach and spilled out
his intestines on the ground. And Joab did not need to strike him
again, for Amasa was dead. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued
Sheba son of Bichri. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One of Joab’s young men stood near Amasa
and said, “Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him
follow Joab!” But Amasa wallowed in his blood in the middle of the
road, and when the man saw that all the troops were stopping there,
he dragged the body off the road into a field and threw a garment
over it. As soon as Amasa’s body was removed from the road, all the
men went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bichri. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Sheba passed through all the tribes of
Israel to Abel-beth-maacah and through the entire region of the
Berites, who gathered together and followed him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Joab’s troops came and besieged
Sheba in Abel-beth-maacah and built a siege ramp against the outer
rampart of the city. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As all the troops with Joab were battering
the wall to topple it, a wise woman called out from the city,
“Listen! Listen! Please tell Joab to come here so that I may speak
with him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When he had come near to her, the woman
asked, “Are you Joab?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I am,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Listen to the words of your servant,”
she said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I am listening,” he answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the woman said, “Long ago they used
to say, ‘Seek counsel at Abel,’ and that is how disputes were
settled. I am among the peaceable and faithful in Israel, but you are
trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why would you
swallow up the LORD’s inheritance?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Far be it!” Joab declared. “Far be
it from me to swallow up or destroy! That is not the case. But a man
named Sheba son of Bichri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has
lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Deliver him
alone, and I will depart from the city.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Look,” the woman replied, “his head
will be thrown to you over the wall.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the woman went to all the people with
her wise counsel, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri
and threw it to Joab. So he blew the ram’s horn and his men
dispersed from the city, each to his own home. And Joab returned to
the king in Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Joab was over the whole army of
Israel; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and
Pelethites; Adoram was in charge of the forced labor; Jehoshaphat son
of Ahilud was the recorder; Sheva was the scribe; Zadok and Abiathar
were priests; and Ira the Jairite was David’s priest. </font>
