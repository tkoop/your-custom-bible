<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Solomon’s Palace Complex</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon, however, took thirteen years to
complete the construction of his entire palace. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He built the House of the Forest of
Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits
high, with four rows of cedar pillars supporting the cedar beams. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The house was roofed with cedar above the
beams that rested on the pillars—forty-five beams, fifteen per row.
There were three rows of high windows facing one another in three
tiers. All the doorways had rectangular frames, with the openings
facing one another in three tiers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Solomon made his colonnade fifty cubits
long and thirty cubits wide, with a portico in front of it and a
canopy with pillars in front of the portico. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In addition, he built a hall for the
throne, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge. It was paneled
with cedar from floor to ceiling. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the palace where Solomon would live,
set further back, was of similar construction. He also made a palace
like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">All these buildings were constructed with
costly stones, cut to size and trimmed with saws inside and out from
the foundation to the eaves, and from the outside to the great
courtyard. The foundations were laid with large, costly stones, some
ten cubits long and some eight cubits long. Above these were
high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The great courtyard was surrounded by
three rows of dressed stone and a row of trimmed cedar beams, as were
the inner courtyard and portico of the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now King Solomon sent to bring Huram from
Tyre. He was the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his
father was a man of Tyre, a craftsman in bronze. Huram had great
skill, understanding, and knowledge for every kind of bronze work. So
he came to King Solomon and carried out all his work. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He cast two pillars of bronze, each
eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference. He also made
two capitals of cast bronze to set on top of the pillars, each
capital five cubits high. For the capitals on top of the pillars he
made a network of lattice, with wreaths of chainwork, seven for each
capital. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Likewise, he made the pillars with two
rows of pomegranates around each grating to cover each capital atop
the pillars. And the capitals atop the pillars in the portico were
shaped like lilies, four cubits high. On the capitals of both
pillars, just above the rounded projection next to the network, were
the two hundred pomegranates in rows encircling each capital. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Thus he set up the pillars at the portico
of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jachin, and the
pillar to the north he named Boaz. And the tops of the pillars were
shaped like lilies. So the work of the pillars was completed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He also made the Sea of cast metal. It was
circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim, five cubits
in height, and thirty cubits in circumference. Below the rim,
ornamental buds encircled it, ten per cubit all the way around the
Sea, cast in two rows as a part of the Sea. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Sea stood on twelve oxen, three facing
north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east.
The Sea rested on them, with all their hindquarters toward the
center. It was a handbreadth thick, and its rim was fashioned like
the brim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It could hold two thousand
baths. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In addition, he made ten movable stands of
bronze, each four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits
high. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This was the design of the stands: They
had side panels attached to uprights, and on the panels between the
uprights were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the uprights was a
pedestal above, and below the lions and oxen were wreaths of beveled
work. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Each stand had four bronze wheels with
bronze axles and a basin resting on four supports, with wreaths at
each side. The opening to each stand inside the crown at the top was
one cubit deep, with a round opening like the design of a pedestal, a
cubit and a half wide. And around its opening were engravings, but
the panels of the stands were square, not round. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">There were four wheels under the panels,
and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand; each wheel
was a cubit and a half in diameter. The wheels were made like chariot
wheels; their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all of cast metal. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Each stand had four handles, one for each
corner, projecting from the stand. At the top of each stand was a
circular band half a cubit high. The supports and panels were cast as
a unit with the top of the stand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He engraved cherubim, lions, and palm
trees on the surfaces of the supports and panels, wherever each had
space, with wreaths all around. In this way he made the ten stands,
each with the same casting, dimensions, and shape. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He also made ten bronze basins, each
holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across, one basin for
each of the ten stands. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He set five stands on the south side of
the temple and five on the north, and he put the Sea on the south
side, at the southeast corner of the temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Additionally, Huram made the pots,
shovels, and sprinkling bowls. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Huram finished all the work that he had
undertaken for King Solomon in the house of the LORD: </font>
