<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Lawsuits among Believers</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>If any of you has a grievance against another, how dare he go to law before the unrighteous instead of before the saints!
<span class="reftext">2</span>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?
<span class="reftext">3</span>Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So if you need to settle everyday matters, do you appoint as judges those of no standing in the church?
<span class="reftext">5</span>I say this to your shame. Is there really no one among you wise enough to arbitrate between his brothers?
<span class="reftext">6</span>Instead, one brother goes to law against another, and this in front of unbelievers!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means that you are thoroughly defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?
<span class="reftext">8</span>Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, even against your own brothers!<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Members of Christ</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who submit to or perform homosexual acts,
<span class="reftext">10</span>nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor verbal abusers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of our God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“Everything is permissible for me,” but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is permissible for me,” but I will not be mastered by anything.
<span class="reftext">13</span>“Food for the stomach and the stomach for food,” but God will destroy them both. The body is not intended for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
<span class="reftext">14</span>By <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> power God raised the Lord from the dead, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will raise us also.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!
<span class="reftext">16</span>Or don’t you know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in spirit.
