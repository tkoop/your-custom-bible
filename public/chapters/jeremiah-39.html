<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of
Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched
against Jerusalem with his entire army and laid siege to the city.
And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh
year, the city was breached. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all the officials of the king of
Babylon entered and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer of
Samgar, Nebo-sarsekim the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and
all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the
soldiers saw them, they fled. They left the city at night by way of
the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls, and they
went out along the route to the Arabah. But the army of the Chaldeans
pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They
seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at
Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment on him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">There at Riblah the king of Babylon
slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also killed
all the nobles of Judah. Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound
him with bronze chains to take him to Babylon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Chaldeans set fire to the palace of
the king and to the houses of the people, and they broke down the
walls of Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Nebuzaradan captain of the guard
carried away to Babylon the remnant of the people who had remained in
the city, along with the deserters who had defected to him. But
Nebuzaradan left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people
who had no property, and at that time he gave them vineyards and
fields. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had
given orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan captain of the guard,
saying, “Take him, look after him, and do not let any harm come to
him; do for him whatever he says.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Nebuzaradan captain of the guard,
Nebushazban the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and all the
captains of the king of Babylon had Jeremiah brought from the
courtyard of the guard, and they turned him over to Gedaliah son of
Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So Jeremiah remained
among his own people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And while Jeremiah had been confined in
the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD had come to him: “Go
and tell Ebed-melech the Cushite that this is what the LORD of Hosts,
the God of Israel, says: ‘I am about to fulfill My words against
this city for harm and not for good, and on that day they will be
fulfilled before your eyes. But I will deliver you on that day,
declares the LORD, and you will not be delivered into the hands of
the men whom you fear. For I will surely rescue you so that you do
not fall by the sword. Because you have trusted in Me, you will
escape with your life like a spoil of war, declares the LORD.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
