<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Fall of Jerusalem<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 25:1–12; 2 Chronicles 36:15–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his entire army and laid siege to the city.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And on the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, the city was breached.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then all the officials of the king of Babylon entered and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-sarsekim<span class="fn">a</span>  the Rabsaris,<span class="fn">b</span>  Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag,<span class="fn">c</span>  and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled. They left the city at night by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls, and they went out along the route to the Arabah.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But the army of the Chaldeans<span class="fn">e</span>  pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> on him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also killed all the nobles of Judah.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with bronze chains to take him to Babylon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>The Chaldeans set fire to the palace of the king and to the houses of the people, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Nebuzaradan captain of the guard carried away to Babylon the remnant of the people who had remained in the city, along with the deserters who had defected to him.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But Nebuzaradan left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people who had no property, and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields.
</p><p class="hdg">Jeremiah Delivered</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, saying,
<span class="reftext">12</span>“Take him, look after him, and do not let any harm come to him; do for him whatever he says.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Nebuzaradan captain of the guard, Nebushazban<span class="fn">f</span>  the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, and all the captains of the king of Babylon
<span class="reftext">14</span>had Jeremiah brought from the courtyard of the guard, and they turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So Jeremiah remained among his own people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And while Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had come to him:
<span class="reftext">16</span>“Go and tell Ebed-melech the Cushite that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘I am about to <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> My words against this city for harm and not for good, and on that day they will be fulfilled before your eyes.
<span class="reftext">17</span>But I will deliver you on that day, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and you will not be delivered into the hands of the men whom you fear.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For I will surely rescue you so that you do not fall by the sword.
