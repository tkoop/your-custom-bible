<span class="reftext">2</span>and say: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘What was your mother? </p><p class="indent"> A lioness among the lions! </p><p class="indent1"> She lay down among the young lions; </p><p class="indent"> she reared her cubs.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>She brought up one of her cubs, </p><p class="indent"> and he became a young lion. </p><p class="indent1"> After learning to tear his prey, </p><p class="indent"> he devoured men.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When the nations heard of him, </p><p class="indent"> he was trapped in their pit. </p><p class="indent1"> With hooks they led him away </p><p class="indent"> to the land of Egypt.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>When she saw that she had waited in vain, </p><p class="indent"> that her hope was lost, </p><p class="indent1"> she took another of her cubs </p><p class="indent"> and made him a young lion.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>He prowled among the lions, </p><p class="indent"> and became a young lion. </p><p class="indent1"> After learning to tear his prey, </p><p class="indent"> he devoured men.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>He broke down their strongholds<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and devastated their cities. </p><p class="indent1"> The land and everything in it </p><p class="indent"> shuddered at the sound of his roaring.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the nations set out against him </p><p class="indent"> from the provinces on every side. </p><p class="indent1"> They spread their net over him; </p><p class="indent"> he was trapped in their pit.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>With hooks they caged him </p><p class="indent"> and brought him to the king of Babylon. </p><p class="indent1"> They brought him into captivity </p><p class="indent"> so that his roar was heard no longer </p><p class="indent"> on the mountains of Israel.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard,<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> planted by the water; </p><p class="indent1"> it was fruitful and full of branches </p><p class="indent"> because of the abundant waters.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>It had strong branches, fit for a ruler’s sceptre. </p><p class="indent"> It towered high above the thick branches, </p><p class="indent1"> conspicuous for its height </p><p class="indent"> and for its dense foliage.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>But it was uprooted in fury, </p><p class="indent"> cast down to the ground, </p><p class="indent"> and the east wind dried up its fruit. </p><p class="indent1"> Its strong branches were stripped off </p><p class="indent"> and they withered; </p><p class="indent"> the fire consumed them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Now it is planted in the wilderness, </p><p class="indent"> in a dry and thirsty land.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Fire has gone out from its main branch </p><p class="indent"> and devoured its fruit; </p><p class="indent1"> on it no strong branch remains </p><p class="indent"> fit for a ruler’s sceptre.’ </p><p class="reg1"> This is a lament and shall be used as a lament.”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">He knew their widows</i> or <i class="calibre6">He seized their widows</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Some Hebrew manuscripts; most Hebrew manuscripts <i class="calibre6">in your bloodline</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
