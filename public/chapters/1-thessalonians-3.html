<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Timothy’s Visit</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>So when we could bear it no longer, we were willing to be left on our own in Athens.
<span class="reftext">2</span>We sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God<span class="fn">a</span>  in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faith,
<span class="reftext">3</span>so that none of you would be shaken by these trials. For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> know that we are destined for this.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Indeed, when we were with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, we kept warning <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> that we would suffer persecution; and as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> know, it has come to pass.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to find out about <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faith, for fear that the tempter had somehow tempted <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and caused our <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> to be in vain.
</p><p class="hdg">Timothy’s Encouraging Report</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>But just now, Timothy has returned from his visit with the good news about <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faith, your love, and the fond memories <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have preserved, longing to see us just as we long to see <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">7</span>For this reason, brothers, in all our distress and persecution, we have been reassured about <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, because of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faith.
<span class="reftext">8</span>For now we can go on living, as long as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are standing firm in the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>How can we adequately thank God for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in return for our great joy over <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> presence?
<span class="reftext">10</span>Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> face to face and supply what is lacking from <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faith.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now may our God and <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span>, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow with love for one another and for everyone else, just as our love for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> overflows,
<span class="reftext">13</span>so that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> may establish <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hearts in blamelessness and holiness before our God and <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> saints.
