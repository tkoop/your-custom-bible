<font ><b>Solomon’s Prayer for Wisdom</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Later, Solomon formed an alliance with
Pharaoh king of Egypt by marrying his daughter. Solomon brought her
to the City of David until he had finished building his palace and
the house of the LORD, as well as the wall around Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The people, however, were still
sacrificing on the high places because a house for the Name of the
LORD had not yet been built. And Solomon loved the LORD and walked in
the statutes of his father David, except that he sacrificed and
burned incense on the high places. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice
there, for it was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand
burnt offerings on the altar there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One night at Gibeon the LORD appeared to
Solomon in a dream, and God said, “Ask, and I will give it to you!”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Solomon replied, “You have shown much
loving devotion to Your servant, my father David, because he walked
before You in faithfulness, righteousness, and uprightness of heart.
And You have maintained this loving devotion by giving him a son to
sit on his throne this very day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now, O LORD my God, You have made Your
servant king in my father David’s place. But I am only a little
child, not knowing how to go out or come in. Your servant is here
among the people You have chosen, a people too numerous to count or
number. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore give Your servant an
understanding heart to judge Your people and to discern between good
and evil. For who is able to govern this great people of Yours?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now it pleased the Lord that Solomon had
made this request. So God said to him, “Since you have asked for
this instead of requesting long life or wealth for yourself or death
for your enemies—but you have asked for discernment to administer
justice— behold, I will do what you have asked. I will give you a
wise and discerning heart, so that there has never been nor will ever
be another like you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, I will give you what you did not
request—both riches and honor—so that during all your days no man
in any kingdom will be your equal. So if you walk in My ways and keep
My statutes and commandments, just as your father David did, I will
prolong your days.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Solomon awoke, and indeed it had been
a dream. So he returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the
covenant of the Lord, and offered burnt offerings and peace
offerings. Then he held a feast for all his servants. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time two prostitutes came to the
king and stood before him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One woman said, “Please, my lord, this
woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth while she was in
the house. On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also had a
baby. We were alone, with no one in the house but the two of us.
During the night this woman’s son died because she rolled over on
him. So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my
side while I was asleep. She laid him in her bosom and put her dead
son at my bosom. The next morning, when I got up to nurse my son, I
discovered he was dead. But when I examined him, I realized that he
was not the son I had borne.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >No,” said the other woman, “the
living one is my son and the dead one is your son.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the first woman insisted, “No, the
dead one is yours and the living one is mine.” So they argued
before the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king replied, “This woman says,
‘My son is alive and yours is dead,’ but that woman says, ‘No,
your son is dead and mine is alive.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The king continued, “Bring me a sword.”
So they brought him a sword, and the king declared, “Cut the living
child in two and give half to one and half to the other.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the woman whose son was alive spoke
to the king because she yearned with compassion for her son. “Please,
my lord,” she said, “give her the living baby. Do not kill him!”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the other woman said, “He will be
neither mine nor yours. Cut him in two!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king gave his ruling: “Give the
living baby to the first woman. By no means should you kill him; she
is his mother.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When all Israel heard of the judgment the
king had given, they stood in awe of him, for they saw that the
wisdom of God was in him to administer justice. </font>
