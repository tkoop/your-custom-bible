<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">One afternoon Peter and John were going up
to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. And a man who
was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called
Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those entering the
temple courts. When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked
them for money. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Peter looked directly at him, as did John.
“Look at us!” said Peter. So the man gave them his attention,
expecting to receive something from them. But Peter said, “Silver
or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you: In the name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Taking him by the right hand, Peter helped
him up, and at once the man’s feet and ankles were made strong. He
sprang to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the
temple courts, walking and leaping and praising God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When all the people saw him walking and
praising God, they recognized him as the man who used to sit begging
at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder
and amazement at what had happened to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While the man clung to Peter and John, all
the people were astonished and ran to them in the walkway called
Solomon’s Colonnade. And when Peter saw this, he addressed the
people: “Men of Israel, why are you surprised by this? Why do you
stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man
walk? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the
God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus. You handed Him
over and rejected Him before Pilate, even though he had decided to
release Him. You rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a
murderer be released to you. You killed the Author of life, but God
raised Him from the dead, and we are witnesses of the fact. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">By faith in the name of Jesus, this man
whom you see and know has been made strong. It is Jesus’ name and
the faith that comes through Him that has given him this complete
healing in your presence. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And now, brothers, I know that you acted
in ignorance, as did your leaders. But in this way God has fulfilled
what He foretold through all the prophets, saying that His Christ
would suffer. Repent, then, and turn back, so that your sins may be
wiped away, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of
the Lord, and that He may send Jesus, the Christ, who has been
appointed for you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Heaven must take Him in until the time
comes for the restoration of all things, which God announced long ago
through His holy prophets. For Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will
raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must
listen to Him in everything He tells you. Everyone who does not
listen to Him will be completely cut off from among his people.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on,
as many as have spoken, have proclaimed these days. And you are sons
of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers when
He said to Abraham, ‘Through your offspring all the families of the
earth will be blessed.’ When God raised up His Servant, He sent Him
first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked
ways.” </font>
