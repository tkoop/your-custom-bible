<span class="reftext">2</span>And a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those entering the temple courts.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">3</span>When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Peter looked directly at him, as did John. “Look at us!” said Peter.
<span class="reftext">5</span>So the man gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!<span class="fn">c</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Taking him by the right hand, Peter helped him up, and at once the man’s feet and ankles were made strong.
<span class="reftext">8</span>He sprang to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and leaping and praising God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>When all the people saw him walking and praising God,
<span class="reftext">10</span>they <span class='spell ca'>recognized</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognized</span> him as the man who used to sit begging at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
</p><p class="hdg">Peter Speaks in Solomon’s Colonnade<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 18:15–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>While the man clung to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and ran to them in the walkway called Solomon’s Colonnade.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And when Peter saw this, he addressed the people: “Men of Israel, why are you surprised by this? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant<span class="fn">e</span>  Jesus. You handed Him over and rejected Him before Pilate, even though he had decided to release Him.
<span class="reftext">14</span>You rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you.
<span class="reftext">15</span>You killed the Author of life, but God raised Him from the dead, and we are witnesses of the fact.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know has been made strong. It is Jesus’ name and the faith that comes through Him that has given him this complete healing in your presence.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.
<span class="reftext">18</span>But in this way God has fulfilled what He foretold through all the prophets, saying that His Christ would suffer.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Repent, then, and turn back, so that your sins may be wiped away,
<span class="reftext">20</span>that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that He may send Jesus, the Christ, who has been appointed for you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Heaven must take Him in until the time comes for the restoration of all things, which God announced long ago through His holy prophets.
<span class="reftext">22</span>For Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to Him in everything He tells you.<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Everyone who does not listen to Him will be completely cut off from among his people.<span class="fn">g</span>’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken, have proclaimed these days.
<span class="reftext">25</span>And you are sons of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers when He said to Abraham, ‘Through your offspring all the families of the earth will be blessed.’<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">26</span>When God raised up His Servant, He sent Him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, three in the afternoon<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i>; also in verse 8<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> SBL, NE, and WH <i class="calibre6">In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk!</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">in the colonnade called Solomon’s</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">His child</i>; also in verse 26<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Deuteronomy 18:15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> See Deuteronomy 18:19.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Genesis 22:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
