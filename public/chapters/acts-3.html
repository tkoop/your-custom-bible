<span class="reftext">3</span>When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Peter looked directly at him, as did John. “Look at us!” said Peter.
<span class="reftext">5</span>So the man gave them his attention, expecting to receive something from them.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But Peter said, “Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!<span class="fn">c</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Taking him by the right hand, Peter helped him up, and at once the man’s feet and ankles were made strong.
<span class="reftext">8</span>He sprang to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and leaping and praising God.
