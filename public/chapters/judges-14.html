<font ><b>Samson’s Riddle</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >One day Samson went down to Timnah, where
he saw a young Philistine woman. So he returned and told his father
and mother, “I have seen a daughter of the Philistines in Timnah.
Now get her for me as a wife.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But his father and mother replied, “Can’t
you find a young woman among your relatives or among any of our
people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But Samson told his father, “Get her for
me, for she is pleasing to my eyes.” (Now his father and mother did
not know this was from the LORD, who was seeking an occasion to move
against the Philistines; for at that time the Philistines were ruling
over Israel.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Samson went down to Timnah with his
father and mother and came to the vineyards of Timnah. Suddenly a
young lion came roaring at him, and the Spirit of the LORD came
powerfully upon him, and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands
as one would tear a young goat. But he did not tell his father or
mother what he had done. Then Samson continued on his way down and
spoke to the woman, because she was pleasing to his eyes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >When Samson returned later to take her, he
left the road to see the lion’s carcass, and in it was a swarm of
bees, along with their honey. So he scooped some honey into his hands
and ate it as he went along. And when he returned to his father and
mother, he gave some to them and they ate it. But he did not tell
them that he had taken the honey from the lion’s carcass. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then his father went to visit the woman,
and Samson prepared a feast there, as was customary for the
bridegroom. And when the Philistines saw him, they selected thirty
men to accompany him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >Let me tell you a riddle,” Samson
said to them. “If you can solve it for me within the seven days of
the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of
clothes. But if you cannot solve it, you must give me thirty linen
garments and thirty sets of clothes.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >Tell us your riddle,” they replied.
“Let us hear it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So he said to them: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >Out of the eater came something to eat,
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >and out of the strong came something
sweet.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >For three days they were unable to explain
the riddle. So on the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife,
“Entice your husband to explain the riddle to us, or we will burn
you and your father’s household to death. Did you invite us here to
rob us?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Samson’s wife came to him, weeping,
and said, “You hate me! You do not really love me! You have posed
to my people a riddle, but have not explained it to me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >Look,” he said, “I have not even
explained it to my father or mother, so why should I explain it to
you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >She wept the whole seven days of the
feast, and finally on the seventh day, because she had pressed him so
much, he told her the answer. And in turn she explained the riddle to
her people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Before sunset on the seventh day, the men
of the city said to Samson: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >What is sweeter than honey? </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And what is stronger than a lion?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So he said to them: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >If you had not plowed with my heifer, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >you would not have solved my riddle!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the Spirit of the LORD came mightily
upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty of their men,
took their apparel, and gave their clothes to those who had solved
the riddle. And burning with anger, Samson returned to his father’s
house, and his wife was given to one of the men who had accompanied
him. </font>
