</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, and sound in faith, love, and perseverance.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Older women, likewise, are to be reverent in their <span class='spell ca'>behaviour</span><span class='spell gb'>behaviour</span><span class='spell us'>behavior</span>, not slanderers or addicted to much wine, but teachers of good.
<span class="reftext">4</span>In this way they can train the young women to love their husbands and children,
<span class="reftext">5</span>to be self-controlled, pure, managers of their households, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be discredited.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>In the same way, urge the younger men to be self-controlled.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>In everything, show yourself to be an example by doing good works. In your teaching show integrity, dignity,
<span class="reftext">8</span>and wholesome speech that is above reproach, so that anyone who opposes us will be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us.

<span class="reftext">12</span>It instructs us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live sensible, upright, and godly lives in the present age,
<span class="reftext">13</span>as we await the blessed hope and glorious appearance of our great God and <span class='cap'>Savior</span><span class='nocap'>savior</span> Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext">14</span>He gave <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> a people for <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own possession, zealous for good deeds.
