<font ><b>Teaching Sound Doctrine</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But as for you, speak the things that are
consistent with sound doctrine. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Older men are to be temperate, dignified,
self-controlled, and sound in faith, love, and perseverance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Older women, likewise, are to be reverent
in their behavior, not slanderers or addicted to much wine, but
teachers of good. In this way they can train the young women to love
their husbands and children, to be self-controlled, pure, managers of
their households, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, so that
the word of God will not be discredited. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the same way, urge the younger men to
be self-controlled. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In everything, show yourself to be an
example by doing good works. In your teaching show integrity,
dignity, and wholesome speech that is above reproach, so that anyone
who opposes us will be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Slaves are to submit to their own masters
in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative, not stealing
from them, but showing all good faith, so that in every respect they
will adorn the teaching about God our Savior. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the grace of God has appeared,
bringing salvation to everyone. It instructs us to renounce
ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live sensible, upright, and
godly lives in the present age, as we await the blessed hope and
glorious appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. He gave
Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for
Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Speak these things as you encourage and
rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you. </font>
