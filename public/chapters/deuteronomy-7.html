<span class="reftext">2</span>and when <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has delivered them over to you to defeat them, then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> must devote them to complete destruction.<span class="fn">a</span>  Make no treaty<span class="fn">b</span>  with them and show them no mercy.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,

<span class="reftext">6</span>For you are a people holy to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God. <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> your God has chosen you to be a people for <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> prized possession out of all peoples on the face of the earth.

<span class="reftext">8</span>But because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> loved <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and kept the oath <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> swore to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

<span class="reftext">16</span>You must destroy all the peoples <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will deliver to you. Do not look on them with pity. Do not worship their gods, for that will be a snare to you.

<span class="reftext">18</span>But do not be afraid of them. Be sure to remember what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt:
<span class="reftext">19</span>the great trials that you saw, the signs and wonders, and the mighty hand and outstretched arm by which <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God brought you out. <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Moreover, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God will send the hornet against them until even the survivors hiding from you have perished.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Do not be terrified by them, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> your God will drive out these nations before you little by little. You will not be enabled to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals would multiply around you.

<span class="reftext">24</span>He will hand their kings over to you, and you will wipe out their names from under <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>. No one will be able to stand against you; you will annihilate them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> must burn up the images of their gods; do not covet the silver and gold that is on them or take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it; for it is detestable to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And you must not bring any detestable thing into your house, or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction.
