<font ><b>Drive Out the Nations</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the LORD your God brings you into the
land that you are entering to possess, and He drives out before you
many nations—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites,
Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger
than you— and when the LORD your God has delivered them over to you
to defeat them, then you must devote them to complete destruction.
Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not intermarry with them. Do not give
your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,
because they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve
other gods. Then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and He
will swiftly destroy you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Instead, this is what you are to do to
them: tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, cut down
their Asherah poles, and burn their idols in the fire. For you are a
people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you to
be a people for His prized possession out of all peoples on the face
of the earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD did not set His affection on you
and choose you because you were more numerous than the other peoples,
for you were the fewest of all peoples. But because the LORD loved
you and kept the oath He swore to your fathers, He brought you out
with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from
the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Know therefore that the LORD your God is
God, the faithful God who keeps His covenant of loving devotion for a
thousand generations of those who love Him and keep His commandments.
But those who hate Him He repays to their faces with destruction; He
will not hesitate to repay to his face the one who hates Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So keep the commandments and statutes and
ordinances that I am giving you to follow this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If you listen to these ordinances and keep
them carefully, then the LORD your God will keep His covenant and the
loving devotion that He swore to your fathers. He will love you and
bless you and multiply you. He will bless the fruit of your womb and
the produce of your land—your grain, new wine, and oil, the young
of your herds and the lambs of your flocks—in the land that He
swore to your fathers to give you. You will be blessed above all
peoples; among you there will be no barren man or woman or livestock.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD will remove from you all
sickness. He will not lay upon you any of the terrible diseases you
knew in Egypt, but He will inflict them on all who hate you. You must
destroy all the peoples the LORD your God will deliver to you. Do not
look on them with pity. Do not worship their gods, for that will be a
snare to you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You may say in your heart, “These
nations are greater than we are; how can we drive them out?” But do
not be afraid of them. Be sure to remember what the LORD your God did
to Pharaoh and all Egypt: the great trials that you saw, the signs
and wonders, and the mighty hand and outstretched arm by which the
LORD your God brought you out. The LORD your God will do the same to
all the peoples you now fear. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, the LORD your God will send the
hornet against them until even the survivors hiding from you have
perished. Do not be terrified by them, for the LORD your God, who is
among you, is a great and awesome God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD your God will drive out these
nations before you little by little. You will not be enabled to
eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals would multiply around
you. But the LORD your God will give them over to you and throw them
into great confusion, until they are destroyed. He will hand their
kings over to you, and you will wipe out their names from under
heaven. No one will be able to stand against you; you will annihilate
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You must burn up the images of their gods;
do not covet the silver and gold that is on them or take it for
yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it; for it is detestable to
the LORD your God. And you must not bring any detestable thing into
your house, or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. You
are to utterly detest and abhor it, because it is set apart for
destruction. </font>
