<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Moab’s Rebellion</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat’s reign over Judah, Jehoram<span class="fn">a</span>  son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria twelve years.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And he did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, but not as his father and mother had done. He removed the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Nevertheless, he clung to the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder,<span class="fn">b</span>  and he would render to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
<span class="reftext">5</span>But after the death of Ahab, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
<span class="reftext">6</span>So at that time King Jehoram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And he sent a message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?” </p><p class="reg1">“I will go,” replied Jehoshaphat. “I am like you, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.”
<span class="reftext">8</span>Then he asked, “Which way shall we go up?” </p><p class="reg1">“By way of the <span class='cap'>Desert</span><span class='nocap'>desert</span> of Edom,” replied Joram.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out, and after they had <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> a roundabout route for seven days, they had no water for their army or for their animals.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>“Alas,” said the king of Israel, “for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hand of Moab!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no prophet of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> here? Let us inquire of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> through him.” </p><p class="reg1"> And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.<span class="fn">c</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Jehoshaphat affirmed, “The word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Elisha, however, said to the king of Israel, “What have we to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and of your mother!” </p><p class="reg1">“No,” replied the king of Israel, “for it is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> who has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then Elisha said, “As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not for my regard for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or acknowledge you.
<span class="reftext">15</span>But now, bring me a harpist.<span class="fn">d</span>” </p><p class="reg1"> And while the harpist played, the hand of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came upon Elisha
<span class="reftext">16</span>and he said, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘Dig this valley full of ditches.’
<span class="reftext">17</span>For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says, ‘You will not see wind or rain, but the valley will be filled with water, and you will drink—you and your cattle and your animals.’
<span class="reftext">18</span>This is a simple matter in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.
<span class="reftext">19</span>And you shall attack every fortified city and every city of importance. You shall cut down every good tree, stop up every spring, and ruin every good field with stones.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>The next morning, at the time of the morning sacrifice, water suddenly flowed from the direction of Edom and filled the land.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. So all who could bear arms, young and old, were summoned and stationed at the border.
<span class="reftext">22</span>When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water, and it looked as red as blood to the Moabites across the way.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>“This is blood!” they exclaimed. “The kings have clashed swords and slaughtered one another. Now to the plunder, Moab!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and attacked them, and they fled before them. So the Israelites invaded their land and struck down the Moabites.
<span class="reftext">25</span>They destroyed the cities, and each man threw stones on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up every spring and cut down every good tree. Only Kir-haraseth was left with stones in place, but men with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not prevail.
<span class="reftext">27</span>So he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him, and offered him as a burnt offering on the city wall. </p><p class="reg1"> And there was great fury against the Israelites,<span class="fn">e</span>  so they withdrew and returned to their own land.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Jehoram</i> is a variant spelling of <i class="calibre6">Joram</i>; also in verse 6.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">sheepherder</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">He was Elijah’s personal assistant</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a musician</i>; twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">And Israel’s fury was great</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
