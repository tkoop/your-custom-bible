<font ><b>Moab’s Rebellion</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat’s
reign over Judah, Jehoram son of Ahab became king of Israel, and he
reigned in Samaria twelve years. And he did evil in the sight of the
LORD, but not as his father and mother had done. He removed the
sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nevertheless, he clung to the sins that
Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn
away from them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep
breeder, and he would render to the king of Israel a hundred thousand
lambs and the wool of a hundred thousand rams. But after the death of
Ahab, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. So at
that time King Jehoram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel.
And he sent a message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah: “The king of
Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against
Moab?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I will go,” replied Jehoshaphat. “I
am like you, my people are your people, and my horses are your
horses.” Then he asked, “Which way shall we go up?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >By way of the Desert of Edom,”
replied Joram. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king of Israel, the king of Judah,
and the king of Edom set out, and after they had traveled a
roundabout route for seven days, they had no water for their army or
for their animals. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Alas,” said the king of Israel, “for
the LORD has summoned these three kings to deliver them into the hand
of Moab!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no
prophet of the LORD here? Let us inquire of the LORD through him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And one of the servants of the king of
Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour
water on the hands of Elijah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jehoshaphat affirmed, “The word of the
LORD is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the
king of Edom went down to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Elisha, however, said to the king of
Israel, “What have we to do with each other? Go to the prophets of
your father and of your mother!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >No,” replied the king of Israel, “for
it is the LORD who has summoned these three kings to deliver them
into the hand of Moab.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Elisha said, “As surely as the LORD
of Hosts lives, before whom I stand, were it not for my regard for
the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or
acknowledge you. But now, bring me a harpist.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And while the harpist played, the hand of
the LORD came upon Elisha and he said, “This is what the LORD says:
‘Dig this valley full of ditches.’ For the LORD says, ‘You will
not see wind or rain, but the valley will be filled with water, and
you will drink—you and your cattle and your animals.’ This is a
simple matter in the sight of the LORD, and He will also deliver the
Moabites into your hand. And you shall attack every fortified city
and every city of importance. You shall cut down every good tree,
stop up every spring, and ruin every good field with stones.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next morning, at the time of the
morning sacrifice, water suddenly flowed from the direction of Edom
and filled the land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now all the Moabites had heard that the
kings had come up to fight against them. So all who could bear arms,
young and old, were summoned and stationed at the border. When they
got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water, and it
looked as red as blood to the Moabites across the way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >This is blood!” they exclaimed. “The
kings have clashed swords and slaughtered one another. Now to the
plunder, Moab!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when the Moabites came to the camp of
Israel, the Israelites rose up and attacked them, and they fled
before them. So the Israelites invaded their land and struck down the
Moabites. They destroyed the cities, and each man threw stones on
every good field until it was covered. They stopped up every spring
and cut down every good tree. Only Kir-haraseth was left with stones
in place, but men with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the king of Moab saw that the battle
was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to
break through to the king of Edom, but they could not prevail. So he
took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him, and offered him as a
burnt offering on the city wall. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And there was great fury against the
Israelites, so they withdrew and returned to their own land. </font>
