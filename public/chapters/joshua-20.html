<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Tell the
Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed you
through Moses, so that anyone who kills another unintentionally or
accidentally may flee there. These will be your refuge from the
avenger of blood. When someone flees to one of these cities, stands
at the entrance of the city gate, and states his case before its
elders, they are to bring him into the city and give him a place to
live among them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now if the avenger of blood pursues him,
they must not surrender the manslayer into his hand, because that man
killed his neighbor accidentally without prior malice. He is to stay
in that city until he stands trial before the assembly and until the
death of the high priest serving at that time. Then the manslayer may
return to his own home in the city from which he fled.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the
hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and
Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And beyond the Jordan, east of Jericho,
they designated Bezer on the wilderness plateau from the tribe of
Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan
from the tribe of Manasseh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">These are the cities appointed for all the
Israelites and foreigners among them, so that anyone who kills a
person unintentionally may flee there and not die by the hand of the
avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly. </font>
