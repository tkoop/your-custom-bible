<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Tradition of the Elders<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 15:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus,
<span class="reftext">2</span>and they saw some of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples eating with hands that were defiled—that is, unwashed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Now in holding to the tradition of the elders, the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat until they wash their hands ceremonially.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And on returning from the market, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions for them to observe, including the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles, and couches for dining.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So the Pharisees and scribes questioned Jesus: “Why do <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with defiled hands.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Jesus answered them, <span>“Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: </span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘These people <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> with their lips, </p><p class="indentred"> but their hearts are far from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">7</span>They worship <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> in vain; </p><p class="indentred"> they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">8</span>You have disregarded the commandment of God to keep the tradition of men.<span class="fn">d</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>He went on to say, <span>“You neatly set aside the command of God to maintain<span class="fn">e</span>  your own tradition.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’<span class="fn">f</span>  and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’<span class="fn">g</span> 
<span class="reftext">11</span>But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is Corban’ (that is, a gift devoted to God),
<span class="reftext">12</span>he is no longer permitted to do anything for his father or mother.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Thus you nullify the word of God by the tradition you have handed down. And you do so in many such matters.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">What Defiles a Man<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 15:10–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Once again Jesus called the crowd to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and said, <span>“All of you, listen to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> and understand:
<span class="reftext">15</span>Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him; but the things that come out of a man, these are what defile him.”</span><span class="fn">h</span> 

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>After Jesus had left the crowd and gone into the house, <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples inquired about the parable.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">18</span>“Are you still so dull?”</span> He asked. <span>“Do you not understand? Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile him,
<span class="reftext">19</span>because it does not enter his heart, but it goes into the stomach and then is eliminated.”</span> (Thus all foods are clean.)<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>He continued: <span>“What comes out of a man, that is what defiles him.
<span class="reftext">21</span>For from within the hearts of men come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,<span class="fn">j</span> 
<span class="reftext">22</span>greed, wickedness, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, arrogance, and foolishness.
<span class="reftext">23</span>All these evils come from within, and these are what defile a man.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Faith of the Gentile Woman<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 15:21–28)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre.<span class="fn">k</span>  Not wanting anyone to know <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was there, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> entered a house, but was unable to escape their notice.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Instead, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit soon heard about Jesus, and she came and fell at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> feet.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Now she was a Greek woman of Syrophoenician origin, and she kept asking Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">27</span>“First let the children have their fill,”</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said. <span>“For it is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “even the dogs<span class="fn">l</span>  under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Then Jesus told her, <span>“Because of this answer, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.”</span>
<span class="reftext">30</span>And she went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone.
</p><p class="hdg">The Deaf and Mute Man<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 9:27–34)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then Jesus left the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span> of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.<span class="fn">m</span> 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Some people brought to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> a man who was deaf and hardly able to speak, and they begged Jesus to place <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hand on him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>So Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, and put <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> fingers into the man’s ears. Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> spit and touched the man’s tongue.
<span class="reftext">34</span>And looking up to heaven, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> sighed deeply and said to him, <span>“Ephphatha!”</span> (which means, <span>“Be opened!”</span>).
<span class="reftext">35</span>Immediately the man’s ears were opened and his tongue was released, and he began to speak plainly.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone. But the more <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> ordered them, the more widely they proclaimed it.
<span class="reftext">37</span>The people were utterly astonished and said, “He has done all things well! He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">until they have washed their hands to the fist</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> NE and WH <i class="calibre6">cups, pitchers, and kettles.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Isaiah 29:13 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">—washings of pots and cups and many such things like these.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> NA <i class="calibre6">establish</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6"><span class="fnv">16</span>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Or <i class="calibre6">and then is eliminated, thereby expelling all foods.”</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Many texts move <i class="calibre6">adultery</i> to verse 22.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> WH, BYZ, and TR include <i class="calibre6">and Sidon</i>; see Matthew 15:21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> Or <i class="calibre6">puppies</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">m</span> That is, the Ten Cities<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
