<font >Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes
who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus, and they saw some
of His disciples eating with hands that were defiled—that is,
unwashed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now in holding to the tradition of the
elders, the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat until they wash
their hands ceremonially. And on returning from the market, they do
not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions for
them to observe, including the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles,
and couches for dining. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the Pharisees and scribes questioned
Jesus: “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition
of the elders? Instead, they eat with defiled hands.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered them, <font color="#a80000">“Isaiah
prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >These people
honor Me with their lips, </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >but their hearts are
far from Me. </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >They worship Me in
vain; </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >they teach as
doctrine the precepts of men.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >You have disregarded
the commandment of God to keep the tradition of men.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He went on to say, <font color="#a80000">“You
neatly set aside the command of God to maintain your own tradition.
For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’ and ‘Anyone
who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’ But you say
that if a man says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would
have received from me is Corban’ (that is, a gift devoted to God),
he is no longer permitted to do anything for his father or mother.
Thus you nullify the word of God by the tradition you have handed
down. And you do so in many such matters.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once again Jesus called the crowd to Him
and said, <font color="#a80000">“All of you, listen to Me and
understand: Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile
him; but the things that come out of a man, these are what defile
him.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Jesus had left the crowd and gone
into the house, His disciples inquired about the parable. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Are you still so
dull?”</font> He asked. <font color="#a80000">“Do you not
understand? Nothing that enters a man from the outside can defile
him, because it does not enter his heart, but it goes into the
stomach and then is eliminated.”</font> (Thus all foods are clean.)
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He continued: <font color="#a80000">“What
comes out of a man, that is what defiles him. For from within the
hearts of men come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder,
adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander,
arrogance, and foolishness. All these evils come from within, and
these are what defile a man.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus left that place and went to the
region of Tyre. Not wanting anyone to know He was there, He entered a
house, but was unable to escape their notice. Instead, a woman whose
little daughter had an unclean spirit soon heard about Jesus, and she
came and fell at His feet. Now she was a Greek woman of
Syrophoenician origin, and she kept asking Jesus to drive the demon
out of her daughter. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >First let the
children have their fill,”</font> He said. <font color="#a80000">“For
it is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the
dogs.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Yes, Lord,” she replied, “even the
dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus told her, <font color="#a80000">“Because
of this answer, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.”</font>
And she went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon
was gone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus left the region of Tyre and
went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the
Decapolis. Some people brought to Him a man who was deaf and hardly
able to speak, and they begged Jesus to place His hand on him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jesus took him aside privately, away
from the crowd, and put His fingers into the man’s ears. Then He
spit and touched the man’s tongue. And looking up to heaven, He
sighed deeply and said to him, <font color="#a80000">“Ephphatha!”</font>
(which means, <font color="#a80000">“Be opened!”</font>).
Immediately the man’s ears were opened and his tongue was released,
and he began to speak plainly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone. But
the more He ordered them, the more widely they proclaimed it. The
people were utterly astonished and said, “He has done all things
well! He makes even the deaf hear and the mute speak!” </font>
