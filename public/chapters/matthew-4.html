<font ><b>The Temptation of Jesus</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the
wilderness to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and
forty nights, He was hungry. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The tempter came to Him and said, “If
You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“It
is written: </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Man shall not
live on bread alone, </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >but on every word
that comes from the mouth of God.’” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the devil took Him to the holy city
and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple. “If You are the Son of
God,” he said, “throw Yourself down. For it is written: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >He will command His angels concerning
You, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and they will lift You up in their hands, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >so that You will not strike Your foot </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >against a stone.’” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“It
is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again, the devil took Him to a very high
mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their
glory. “All this I will give You,” he said, “if You will fall
down and worship me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Away from Me,
Satan!”</font> Jesus declared. <font color="#a80000">“For it is
written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the devil left Him, and angels came
and ministered to Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus heard that John had been
imprisoned, He withdrew to Galilee. Leaving Nazareth, He went and
lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the region of Zebulun and
Naphtali, to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Land of Zebulun </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and land of Naphtali, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, </font>

<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >a light has dawned.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From that time on Jesus began to preach,
<font color="#a80000">“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of
Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother
Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were
fishermen. <font color="#a80000">“Come, follow Me,”</font> Jesus
said, <font color="#a80000">“and I will make you fishers of men.”</font>
And at once they left their nets and followed Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Going on from there, He saw two other
brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a
boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called
them, and immediately they left the boat and their father and
followed Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in
their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing
every disease and sickness among the people. News about Him spread
all over Syria, and people brought to Him all who were ill with
various diseases, those suffering acute pain, the demon-possessed,
those having seizures, and the paralyzed—and He healed them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The large crowds that followed Him came
from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
