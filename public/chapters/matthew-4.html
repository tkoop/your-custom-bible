<span class="reftext">2</span>After fasting forty days and forty nights, He was hungry.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>The tempter came to Him and said, “If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But Jesus answered, <span>“It is written: </span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘Man shall not live on bread alone, </p><p class="indentred"> but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’<span class="fn">a</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple.
<span class="reftext">6</span>“If You are the Son of God,” he said, “throw Yourself down. For it is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘He will command His angels concerning You, </p><p class="indent"> and they will lift You up in their hands, </p><p class="indent1"> so that You will not strike Your foot </p><p class="indent"> against a stone.’<span class="fn">b</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Jesus replied, <span>“It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’<span class="fn">c</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
<span class="reftext">9</span>“All this I will give You,” he said, “if You will fall down and worship me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">10</span>“Away from Me, Satan!”</span> Jesus declared. <span>“For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’<span class="fn">d</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then the devil left Him, and angels came and ministered to Him.

<span class="reftext">13</span>Leaving Nazareth, He went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
<span class="reftext">14</span>to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>“Land of Zebulun </p><p class="indent"> and land of Naphtali, </p><p class="indent1"> the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, </p><p class="indent"> Galilee of the Gentiles—

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>From that time on Jesus began to preach, <span>“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”</span>

They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
<span><span class="reftext">19</span>“Come, follow Me,”</span> Jesus said, <span>“and I will make you fishers of men.”</span>
<span class="reftext">20</span>And at once they left their nets and followed Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them,
<span class="reftext">22</span>and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him.

<span class="reftext">24</span>News about Him spread all over Syria, and people brought to Him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering acute pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed—and He healed them.
