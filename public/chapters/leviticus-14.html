<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “This is
the law for the one afflicted with a skin disease on the day of his
cleansing, when he is brought to the priest. The priest is to go
outside the camp to examine him, and if the skin disease of the
afflicted person has healed, the priest shall order that two live
clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop be brought for the
one to be cleansed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the priest shall command that one of
the birds be slaughtered over fresh water in a clay pot. And he is to
take the live bird together with the cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and
hyssop, and dip them into the blood of the bird that was slaughtered
over the fresh water. Seven times he shall sprinkle the one to be
cleansed of the skin disease. Then he shall pronounce him clean and
release the live bird into the open field. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The one being cleansed must wash his
clothes, shave off all his hair, and bathe with water; then he will
be ceremonially clean. Afterward, he may enter the camp, but he must
remain outside his tent for seven days. On the seventh day he must
shave off all his hair—his head, his beard, his eyebrows, and the
rest of his hair. He must wash his clothes and bathe himself with
water, and he will be clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the eighth day he is to bring two
unblemished male lambs, an unblemished ewe lamb a year old, a grain
offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive
oil, and one log of olive oil. The priest who performs the cleansing
shall present the one to be cleansed, together with these offerings,
before the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the priest is to take one of the male
lambs and present it as a guilt offering, along with the log of olive
oil; and he must wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. Then
he is to slaughter the lamb in the sanctuary area where the sin
offering and burnt offering are slaughtered. Like the sin offering,
the guilt offering belongs to the priest; it is most holy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The priest is to take some of the blood
from the guilt offering and put it on the right earlobe of the one to
be cleansed, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of
his right foot. Then the priest shall take some of the log of olive
oil, pour it into his left palm, dip his right forefinger into the
oil in his left palm, and sprinkle some of the oil with his finger
seven times before the LORD. And the priest is to put some of the oil
remaining in his palm on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed,
on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot,
on top of the blood of the guilt offering. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The rest of the oil in his palm, the
priest is to put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make
atonement for him before the LORD. Then the priest is to sacrifice
the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from
his uncleanness. After that, the priest shall slaughter the burnt
offering and offer it on the altar, with the grain offering, to make
atonement for him, and he will be clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If, however, the person is poor and cannot
afford these offerings, he is to take one male lamb as a guilt
offering to be waved to make atonement for him, along with a tenth of
an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil for a grain offering, a
log of olive oil, and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, whichever
he can afford, one to be a sin offering and the other a burnt
offering. </font>

Then the priest is to pour some of the oil into his left palm and

seven times before the LORD. The priest shall also put some of the
oil in his palm on the right earlobe of the one to be cleansed, on
the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot—on
the same places as the blood of the guilt offering. </font>
