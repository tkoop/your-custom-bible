<span class="reftext">2</span>“Command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Outside the veil of the Testimony<span class="fn">a</span>  in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps continually before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a permanent statute for the generations to come.
<span class="reftext">4</span>He shall tend the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually.

<span class="reftext">7</span>And you are to place pure frankincense near each row, so that it may serve as a memorial portion for the bread, an offering made by fire to the LORD.

<span class="reftext">11</span>The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse. So they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>They placed him in custody until the will of the LORD should be made clear to them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then the LORD said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">14</span>“Take the blasphemer<span class="fn">c</span>  outside the camp, and have all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then have the whole assembly stone him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And you are to tell the Israelites, ‘If anyone curses his God, he shall bear the consequences of his sin.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD must surely be put to death; the whole assembly must surely stone him, whether he is a foreign resident or native; if he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.
