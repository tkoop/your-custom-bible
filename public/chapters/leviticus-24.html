<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Command
the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light,
to keep the lamps burning continually. </font>

<font >Outside the veil of the Testimony in the
Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps continually before the
LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a permanent statute
for the generations to come. He shall tend the lamps on the pure gold
lampstand before the LORD continually. </font>

<font >You are also to take fine flour and bake
twelve loaves, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf, and set
them in two rows—six per row—on the table of pure gold before the
LORD. And you are to place pure frankincense near each row, so that
it may serve as a memorial portion for the bread, an offering made by
fire to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Every Sabbath day the bread is to be set
out before the LORD on behalf of the Israelites as a permanent
covenant. It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a
holy place; for it is to him a most holy part of the offerings made
by fire to the LORD—his portion forever.” </font>

<font >Now the son of an Israelite mother and an
Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out
in the camp between him and an Israelite. The son of the Israelite
woman blasphemed the Name with a curse. So they brought him to Moses.
(His mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of
Dan.) </font>

<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Take the
blasphemer outside the camp, and have all who heard him lay their
hands on his head; then have the whole assembly stone him. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you are to tell the Israelites, ‘If
anyone curses his God, he shall bear the consequences of his sin.
Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD must surely be put to death;
the whole assembly must surely stone him, whether he is a foreign
resident or native; if he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to
death. </font>

else, he must surely be put to death. Whoever kills an animal must
make restitution—life for life. If anyone injures his neighbor,
whatever he has done must be done to him: fracture for fracture, eye
for eye, tooth for tooth. Just as he injured the other person, the
same must be inflicted on him. </font>
