twelve loaves, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf, and set
them in two rows—six per row—on the table of pure gold before the

it may serve as a memorial portion for the bread, an offering made by
fire to the LORD. </font>

Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out
in the camp between him and an Israelite. The son of the Israelite

Dan.) </font>
