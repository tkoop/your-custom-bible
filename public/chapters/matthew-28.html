<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Resurrection<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 16:1–8; Luke 24:1–12; John 20:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,<span class="fn">a</span>  Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>, rolled away the stone, and sat on it.
<span class="reftext">3</span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
<span class="reftext">4</span>The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
<span class="reftext">6</span>He is not here; <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has risen, just as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said! Come, see the place where <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> lay.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then go quickly and tell <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> into Galilee. There <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will see <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.’ See, I have told <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Suddenly<span class="fn">c</span>  Jesus met them and said, <span>“Greetings!”</span> They came to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, grasped <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> feet, and worshiped <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span><span class="reftext">10</span>“Do not be afraid,”</span> said Jesus. <span>“Go and tell <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Report of the Guards</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money
<span class="reftext">13</span>and instructed them: “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> away while we were asleep.’
<span class="reftext">14</span>If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> out of trouble.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day.
</p><p class="hdg">The Great Commission<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 16:14–18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated.
<span class="reftext">17</span>When they saw <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, they worshiped <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, but some doubted.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then Jesus came to them and said, <span>“All authority in <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> and on <span class='nocap'>Earth</span><span class='cap'>Earth</span><span class='bsb'>earth</span> has been given to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Therefore go and make disciples<span class="fn">d</span>  of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>, and of the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span>, and of the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>,
