<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first
day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the
tomb. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for
an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone,
and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes
were white as snow. The guards trembled in fear of him and became
like dead men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the angel said to the women, “Do not
be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was
crucified. He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see
the place where He lay. Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He
has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There
you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they hurried away from the tomb in fear
and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them
and said, <font color="#a80000">“Greetings!”</font> They came to
Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him. <font color="#a80000">“Do
not be afraid,”</font> said Jesus. <font color="#a80000">“Go and
tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While the women were on their way, some of
the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all
that had happened. And after the chief priests had met with the
elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money
and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by
night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’ If this report
reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of
trouble.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the guards took the money and did as
they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the
Jews to this very day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to
Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated. When they saw Him,
they worshiped Him, but some doubted. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus came to them and said, <font color="#a80000">“All
authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Therefore go
and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to
obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always,
even to the end of the age.”</font> </font>
