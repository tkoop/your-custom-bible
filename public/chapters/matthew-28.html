<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Resurrection<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 16:1–8; Luke 24:1–12; John 20:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,<span class="fn">a</span>  Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it.
<span class="reftext">3</span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
<span class="reftext">4</span>The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
<span class="reftext">6</span>He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Suddenly<span class="fn">c</span>  Jesus met them and said, <span>“Greetings!”</span> They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him.
<span><span class="reftext">10</span>“Do not be afraid,”</span> said Jesus. <span>“Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Report of the Guards</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.
<span class="reftext">12</span>And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money
<span class="reftext">13</span>and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’
<span class="reftext">14</span>If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day.
</p><p class="hdg">The Great Commission<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 16:14–18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated.
<span class="reftext">17</span>When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then Jesus came to them and said, <span>“All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Therefore go and make disciples<span class="fn">d</span>  of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
<span class="reftext">20</span>and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”</span></p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Now after the Sabbaths, it being dawn toward the first of the Sabbaths,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">where the Lord lay</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">They were going to tell His disciples, and suddenly</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Having gone, therefore, make disciples</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
