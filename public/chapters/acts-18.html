<font ><b>Paul Ministers in Corinth</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After this, Paul left Athens and went to
Corinth. There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who
had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius
had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them, and
he stayed and worked with them because they were tentmakers by trade,
just as he was. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Every Sabbath he reasoned in the
synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks alike. And when Silas
and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself fully to
the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ. But when
they opposed and insulted him, he shook out his garments and told
them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent of it. From
now on I will go to the Gentiles.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Paul left the synagogue and went next
door to the house of Titus Justus, a worshiper of God. Crispus, the
synagogue leader, and his whole household believed in the Lord. And
many of the Corinthians who heard the message believed and were
baptized. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a
vision: <font color="#a80000">“Do not be afraid; keep on speaking;
do not be silent. For I am with you and no one will lay a hand on
you, because I have many people in this city.”</font> So Paul
stayed for a year and a half, teaching the word of God among the
Corinthians. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the
Jews coordinated an attack on Paul and brought him before the
judgment seat. “This man is persuading the people to worship God in
ways contrary to the law,” they said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But just as Paul was about to speak,
Gallio told the Jews, “If this matter involved a wrongdoing or
vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to hear your
complaint. But since it is a dispute about words and names and your
own law, settle it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of such
things.” And he drove them away from the judgment seat. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, the crowd seized Sosthenes the
synagogue leader and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But none
of this was of concern to Gallio. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Paul remained in Corinth for quite some
time before saying goodbye to the brothers. He had his head shaved in
Cenchrea to keep a vow he had made, and then he sailed for Syria,
accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they reached Ephesus, Paul parted
ways with Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue
there and reasoned with the Jews. When they asked him to stay for a
while longer, he declined. But as he left, he said, “I will come
back to you if God is willing.” And he set sail from Ephesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Paul had landed at Caesarea, he went
up and greeted the church at Jerusalem. Then he went down to Antioch.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Paul had spent some time in Antioch,
he traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and
Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of
Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in
the Scriptures. He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and was
fervent in spirit. He spoke and taught accurately about Jesus, though
he knew only the baptism of John. And he began to speak boldly in the
synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him in and
explained to him the way of God more accurately. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Apollos resolved to cross over to
Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there
to welcome him. On his arrival, he was a great help to those who by
grace had believed. For he powerfully refuted the Jews in public
debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ. </font>
