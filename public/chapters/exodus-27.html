“<font >You are to build an altar of acacia
wood. The altar must be square, five cubits long, five cubits wide,
and three cubits high. Make a horn on each of its four corners, so
that the horns are of one piece, and overlay it with bronze. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make all its utensils of bronze—its pots
for removing ashes, its shovels, its sprinkling bowls, its meat
forks, and its firepans. Construct for it a grate of bronze mesh, and
make a bronze ring at each of the four corners of the mesh. Set the
grate beneath the ledge of the altar, so that the mesh comes halfway
up the altar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Additionally, make poles of acacia wood
for the altar and overlay them with bronze. The poles are to be
inserted into the rings so that the poles are on two sides of the
altar when it is carried. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Construct the altar with boards so that it
is hollow. It is to be made just as you were shown on the mountain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are also to make a courtyard for the
tabernacle. On the south side of the courtyard make curtains of
finely spun linen, a hundred cubits long on one side, with twenty
posts and twenty bronze bases, and silver hooks and bands on the
posts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Likewise there are to be curtains on the
north side, a hundred cubits long, with twenty posts and twenty
bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts. The
curtains on the west side of the courtyard shall be fifty cubits
wide, with ten posts and ten bases. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The east side of the courtyard, toward the
sunrise, is to be fifty cubits wide. Make the curtains on one side
fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases, and the
curtains on the other side fifteen cubits long, with three posts and
three bases. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The gate of the courtyard shall be twenty
cubits long, with a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and
scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. It shall have four posts and
four bases. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All the posts around the courtyard shall
have silver bands, silver hooks, and bronze bases. The entire
courtyard shall be a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide, with
curtains of finely spun linen five cubits high, and with bronze
bases. All the utensils of the tabernacle for every use, including
all its tent pegs and the tent pegs of the courtyard, shall be made
of bronze. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you are to command the Israelites to
bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps
burning continually. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil
that is in front of the Testimony, Aaron and his sons are to tend the
lamps before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a
permanent statute for the Israelites for the generations to come. </font>
