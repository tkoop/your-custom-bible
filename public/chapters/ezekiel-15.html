<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jerusalem the Useless Vine</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to me, saying,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any other branch among the trees in the forest?
<span class="reftext">3</span>Can wood be taken from it to make something useful? Or can one make from it a peg on which to hang utensils?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>No, it is cast into the fire for fuel. The fire devours both ends, and the middle is charred. Can it be useful for anything?
<span class="reftext">5</span>Even when it was whole, it could not be made useful. How much less can it ever be useful when the fire has consumed it and charred it!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the people of Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And I will set My face against them. Though they may have escaped the fire, yet another fire will consume them. And when I set My face against them, you will know that I am <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,’ declares the Lord GOD.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
