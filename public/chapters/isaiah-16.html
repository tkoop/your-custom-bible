</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Like fluttering birds </p><p class="indent"> pushed out of the nest, </p><p class="indent1"> so are the daughters of Moab </p><p class="indent"> at the fords of the Arnon:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>“Give us counsel; </p><p class="indent"> render a decision. </p><p class="indent1"> Shelter us at noonday </p><p class="indent"> with shade as dark as night. </p><p class="indent1"> Hide the refugees; </p><p class="indent"> do not betray the one who flees.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Let my fugitives stay with you; </p><p class="indent"> be a refuge for Moab from the destroyer.” </p><p class="indent1stline"> When the oppressor has gone, destruction has ceased, </p><p class="indent"> and the oppressors have vanished from the land,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>in loving devotion<span class="fn">a</span>  a throne will be established </p><p class="indent"> in the tent of David. </p><p class="indent1"> A judge seeking justice and hastening righteousness </p><p class="indent"> will sit on it in faithfulness.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>We have heard of Moab’s pomposity, </p><p class="indent"> his exceeding pride and conceit, </p><p class="indent1"> his overflowing arrogance. </p><p class="indent"> But his boasting is empty.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore let Moab wail; </p><p class="indent"> let them wail together for Moab. </p><p class="indent1"> Moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth, </p><p class="indent"> you who are utterly stricken.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>For the fields of Heshbon have withered, </p><p class="indent"> along with the grapevines of Sibmah. </p><p class="indent1"> The rulers of the nations </p><p class="indent"> have trampled its choicest vines, </p><p class="indent1"> which had reached as far as Jazer </p><p class="indent"> and spread toward the desert. </p><p class="indent1"> Their shoots had spread out </p><p class="indent"> and passed over the sea.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>So I weep with Jazer </p><p class="indent"> for the vines of Sibmah; </p><p class="indent1"> I drench Heshbon and Elealeh </p><p class="indent"> with my tears. </p><p class="indent1"> Triumphant shouts have fallen silent </p><p class="indent"> over your summer fruit and your harvest.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Joy and gladness are removed from the orchard; </p><p class="indent"> no one sings or shouts in the vineyards. </p><p class="indent1"> No one tramples the grapes in the winepresses; </p><p class="indent"> I have put an end to the cheering.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore my heart laments for Moab like a harp, </p><p class="indent"> my inmost being for Kir-heres.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>When Moab appears on the high place, </p><p class="indent"> when he wearies himself </p><p class="indent1"> and enters his sanctuary to pray, </p><p class="indent"> it will do him no good.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>This is the message that the LORD spoke earlier concerning Moab.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And now the LORD says, “In three years, as a hired worker counts the years, Moab’s splendour will become an object of contempt, with all her many people. And those who are left will be few and feeble.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">chesed</i> are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as <i class="calibre6">loving devotion</i>; the range of meaning includes <i class="calibre6">love</i>, <i class="calibre6">goodness</i>, <i class="calibre6">kindness</i>, <i class="calibre6">faithfulness</i>, and <i class="calibre6">mercy</i>, as well as <i class="calibre6">loyalty to a covenant</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">and had gone as far as the sea</i>; that is, probably the Dead Sea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Kir-heres</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Kir-hareseth</i>; see verse 7.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
