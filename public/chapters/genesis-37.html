<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Joseph’s Dreams</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now Jacob lived in the land where his father had resided, the land of Canaan.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>This is the account of Jacob. When Joseph was seventeen years old, he was tending the flock with his brothers, the sons of his father’s wives Bilhah and Zilpah, and he brought their father a bad report about them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons, because Joseph had been born to him in his old age; so he made him a robe of many colors.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.
<span class="reftext">6</span>He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had:
<span class="reftext">7</span>We were binding sheaves of grain in the field, and suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sheaves gathered around and bowed down to mine.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>“Do you intend to reign over us?” his brothers asked. “Will you actually rule us?” So they hated him even more because of his dream and his statements.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Joseph had another dream and told it to his brothers. “Look,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>He told his father and brothers, but his father rebuked him and said, “What is this dream that you have had? Will your mother and brothers and I actually come and bow down to the ground before you?”
<span class="reftext">11</span>And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept in mind what he had said.
</p><p class="hdg">Joseph Sold into Egypt<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 7:9–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Some time later, Joseph’s brothers had gone to pasture their father’s flocks near Shechem.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Israel said to him, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flocks at Shechem? Get ready; I am sending <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to them.” </p><p class="reg1">“I am ready,” Joseph replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then Israel told him, “Go now and see how your brothers and the flocks are faring, and bring word back to me.” </p><p class="reg1"> So he sent him off from the <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span> of Hebron. And when Joseph arrived in Shechem,
<span class="reftext">15</span>a man found him wandering in the field and asked, “What are you looking for?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>“I am looking for my brothers,” Joseph replied. “Can you please tell me where they are pasturing their flocks?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>“They have moved on from here,” the man answered. “I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” So Joseph set out after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Now Joseph’s brothers saw him in the distance, and before he arrived, they plotted to kill him.
<span class="reftext">19</span>“Here comes that dreamer!” they said to one another.
<span class="reftext">20</span>“Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits. We can say that a vicious animal has devoured him. Then we shall see what becomes of his dreams!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue Joseph from their hands. “Let us not take his life,” he said.
<span class="reftext">22</span>“Do not shed his blood. Throw him into this pit in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this so that he could rescue Joseph from their hands and return him to his father.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the robe of many colors he was wearing—
<span class="reftext">24</span>and they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty, with no water in it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>And as they sat down to eat a meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying spices, balm, and myrrh on their way down to Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
<span class="reftext">27</span>Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him; for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And they agreed.
<span class="reftext">28</span>So when the Midianite traders passed by, his brothers pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him for twenty shekels of silver<span class="fn">b</span>  to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes,
<span class="reftext">30</span>returned to his brothers, and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?”
</p><p class="hdg">Jacob Mourns Joseph</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then they took Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a young goat, and dipped the robe in its blood.
<span class="reftext">32</span>They sent the robe of many colors to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe or not.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>His father <span class='spell ca'>recognized</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognized</span> it and said, “It is my son’s robe! A vicious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces!”
<span class="reftext">34</span>Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth around his waist, and mourned for his son many days.
<span class="reftext">35</span>All his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said. “I will go down to Sheol mourning for my son.” So his father wept for him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Meanwhile, the Midianites<span class="fn">c</span>  sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Possibly <i class="calibre6">a robe with long sleeves</i>; also in verses 23 and 32<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">20 shekels</i> is approximately 8 ounces or 228 grams of silver.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the Medanites</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
