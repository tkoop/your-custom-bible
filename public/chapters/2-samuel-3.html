<font face="Tahoma, serif">During the war between the house of Saul
and the house of David, Abner had continued to strengthen his
position in the house of Saul. Meanwhile, Saul had a concubine named
Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. So Ish-bosheth questioned Abner, “Why
did you sleep with my father’s concubine?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Abner was furious over Ish-bosheth’s
accusation. “Am I the head of a dog that belongs to Judah?” he
asked. “All this time I have been loyal to the house of your father
Saul, to his brothers, and to his friends. I have not delivered you
into the hand of David, but now you accuse me of wrongdoing with this
woman! May God punish Abner, and ever so severely, if I do not do for
David what the LORD has sworn to him: to transfer the kingdom from
the house of Saul and to establish the throne of David over Israel
and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And for fear of Abner, Ish-bosheth did not
dare to say another word to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Abner sent messengers in his place to
say to David, “To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant
with me, and surely my hand will be with you to bring all Israel over
to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Good,” replied David, “I will make
a covenant with you. But there is one thing I require of you: Do not
appear before me unless you bring Saul’s daughter Michal when you
come to see me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David sent messengers to say to
Ish-bosheth son of Saul, “Give me back my wife, Michal, whom I
betrothed to myself for a hundred Philistine foreskins.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Ish-bosheth sent and took Michal from
her husband Paltiel son of Laish. Her husband followed her, weeping
all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go back.” So he
returned home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Abner conferred with the elders of
Israel and said, “In the past you sought David as your king. Now
take action, because the LORD has said to David, ‘Through My
servant David I will save My people Israel from the hands of the
Philistines and of all their enemies.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Abner also spoke to the Benjamites and
went to Hebron to tell David all that seemed good to Israel and to
the whole house of Benjamin. When Abner and twenty of his men came to
David at Hebron, David held a feast for them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Abner said to David, “Let me go at
once, and I will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may
make a covenant with you, and that you may rule over all that your
heart desires.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David dismissed Abner, and he went in
peace. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Just then David’s soldiers and Joab
returned from a raid, bringing with them a great plunder. But Abner
was not with David in Hebron because David had sent him on his way in
peace. When Joab and all his troops arrived, he was informed, “Abner
son of Ner came to see the king, who sent him on his way in peace.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Joab went to the king and said, “What
have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you dismiss him? Now
he is getting away! Surely you realize that Abner son of Ner came to
deceive you and to track your movements and all that you are doing.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As soon as Joab had left David, he sent
messengers after Abner, who brought him back from the well of Sirah;
but David was unaware of it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab pulled
him aside into the gateway, as if to speak to him privately, and
there Joab stabbed him in the stomach. So Abner died on account of
the blood of Joab’s brother Asahel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Afterward, David heard about this and
said, “I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the LORD
concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner. May it whirl over the heads
of Joab and the entire house of his father, and may the house of Joab
never be without one having a discharge or skin disease, or one who
leans on a staff or falls by the sword or lacks food.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">(Joab and his brother Abishai murdered
Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at
Gibeon.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David ordered Joab and all the people
with him, “Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before
Abner.” And King David himself walked behind the funeral bier. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When they buried Abner in Hebron, the king
wept aloud at Abner’s tomb, and all the people wept. And the king
sang this lament for Abner: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Should Abner die </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As a man falls before the wicked, </font>

more. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all the people came and urged David
to eat something while it was still day, but David took an oath,
saying, “May God punish me, and ever so severely, if I taste bread
or anything else before the sun sets!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">All the people took note and were pleased.
In fact, everything the king did pleased them. So on that day all the
troops and all Israel were convinced that the king had no part in the
murder of Abner son of Ner. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king said to his servants, “Do
you not realize that a great prince has fallen today in Israel? And I
am weak this day, though anointed as king, and these men, the sons of
Zeruiah, are too fierce for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer
according to his evil!” </font>
