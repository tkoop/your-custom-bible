<font >This was the inheritance of the clans of
the tribe of Simeon. The inheritance of the Simeonites was taken from
the territory of Judah, because the share for Judah’s descendants
was too large for them. So the Simeonites received an inheritance
within Judah’s portion. </font>

Japhia. From there it crossed eastward to Gath-hepher and to
Eth-kazin; it extended to Rimmon and curved around toward Neah. Then
the border circled around the north side of Neah to Hannathon and
ended at the Valley of Iphtah-el. It also included Kattath, Nahalal,
Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem. There were twelve cities, along with

border touched Carmel and Shihor-libnath, then turned eastward toward
Beth-dagon, touched Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtah-el, and went
north to Beth-emek and Neiel, passing Cabul on the left. It went on
to Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon. The
border then turned back toward Ramah as far as the fortified city of
Tyre, turned toward Hosah, and came out at the Sea in the region of
Achzib, Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob. There were twenty-two cities, along

<font >When they had finished distributing the
land into its territories, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an
inheritance among them, as the LORD had commanded. They gave him the

the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the families
