<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
the Israelites and take from them twelve staffs, one from the leader
of each tribe. Write each man’s name on his staff, and write
Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi, because there must be one staff
for the head of each tribe. Place the staffs in the Tent of Meeting
in front of the Testimony, where I meet with you. The staff belonging
to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid Myself of the
constant grumbling of the Israelites against you.” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each
of their leaders gave him a staff—one for each of the leaders of
their tribes, twelve staffs in all. And Aaron’s staff was among
them. Then Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the Tent of the
Testimony. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">The next day Moses entered the Tent of the
Testimony and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of
Levi, had sprouted, put forth buds, blossomed, and produced almonds.
Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD’s presence to
all the Israelites. They saw them, and each man took his own staff. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s
staff back in front of the Testimony, to be kept as a sign for the
rebellious, so that you may put an end to their grumbling against Me,
lest they die.” So Moses did as the LORD had commanded him. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Israelites declared to Moses,
“Look, we are perishing! We are lost; we are all lost! Anyone who
comes near the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all going to
perish?” </font>
