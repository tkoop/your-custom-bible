<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Aaron’s Staff Buds</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Speak to the Israelites and take from them twelve staffs, one from the leader of each tribe. Write each man’s name on his staff,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi, because there must be one staff for the head of each tribe.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Place the staffs in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony,<span class="fn">a</span>  where I meet with you.
<span class="reftext">5</span>The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid Myself of the constant grumbling of the Israelites against you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a staff—one for each of the leaders of their tribes, twelve staffs in all. And Aaron’s staff was among them.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then Moses placed the staffs before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> in the Tent of the Testimony.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>The next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, put forth buds, blossomed, and produced almonds.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then Moses brought out all the staffs from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>’s presence to all the Israelites. They saw them, and each man took his own staff.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the Testimony, to be kept as a sign for the rebellious, so that you may put an end to their grumbling against Me, lest they die.”
<span class="reftext">11</span>So Moses did as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then the Israelites declared to Moses, “Look, we are perishing! We are lost; we are all lost!
<span class="reftext">13</span>Anyone who comes near the tabernacle of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will die. Are we all going to perish?”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">The Testimony</i> refers to the stone tablets in the ark of the covenant inscribed with the Ten Commandments; also in verse 10.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
