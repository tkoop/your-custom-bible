<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Ark Rests on Ararat</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>But God remembered Noah and all the animals and livestock that were with him in the ark. And God sent a wind over the earth, and the waters began to subside.
<span class="reftext">2</span>The springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The waters receded steadily from the earth, and after 150 days the waters had gone down.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.
</p><p class="hdg">Noah Sends a Raven and a Dove</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark
<span class="reftext">7</span>and sent out a raven. It kept flying back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Noah sent out<span class="fn">a</span>  a dove to see if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground.
<span class="reftext">9</span>But the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him in the ark, because the waters were still covering the surface of all the earth. So he reached out his hand and brought her back inside the ark.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Noah waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And behold, the dove returned to him in the evening with a freshly plucked olive leaf in her beak. So Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And Noah waited seven more days and sent out the dove again, but this time she did not return to him.
</p><p class="hdg">Exiting the Ark</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>In Noah’s six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters had dried up from the earth. So Noah removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
<span class="reftext">14</span>By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was fully dry.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then God said to Noah,
<span class="reftext">16</span>“Come out of the ark, you and your wife, along with your sons and their wives.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Bring out all the living creatures that are with you—birds, livestock, and everything that crawls upon the ground—so that they can spread out over the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>So Noah came out, along with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Every living creature, every creeping thing, and every bird—everything that moves upon the earth—came out of the ark, kind by kind.
</p><p class="hdg">Noah Builds an Altar</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then Noah built an altar to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. And taking from every kind of clean animal and clean bird, he offered burnt offerings on the altar.
<span class="reftext">21</span>When <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> smelled the pleasing aroma, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> heart, “Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from his youth. And never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done.
