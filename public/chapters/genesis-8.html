<font ><b>The Ark Rests on Ararat</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But God remembered Noah and all the
animals and livestock that were with him in the ark. And God sent a
wind over the earth, and the waters began to subside. The springs of
the deep and the floodgates of the heavens were closed, and the rain
from the sky was restrained. The waters receded steadily from the
earth, and after 150 days the waters had gone down. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the seventeenth day of the seventh
month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. And the
waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first
day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After forty days Noah opened the window he
had made in the ark and sent out a raven. It kept flying back and
forth until the waters had dried up from the earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Noah sent out a dove to see if the
waters had receded from the surface of the ground. But the dove found
no place to rest her foot, and she returned to him in the ark,
because the waters were still covering the surface of all the earth.
So he reached out his hand and brought her back inside the ark. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Noah waited seven more days and again sent
out the dove from the ark. And behold, the dove returned to him in
the evening with a freshly plucked olive leaf in her beak. So Noah
knew that the waters had receded from the earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Noah waited seven more days and sent
out the dove again, but this time she did not return to him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In Noah’s six hundred and first year, on
the first day of the first month, the waters had dried up from the
earth. So Noah removed the covering from the ark and saw that the
surface of the ground was dry. By the twenty-seventh day of the
second month, the earth was fully dry. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then God said to Noah, “Come out of the
ark, you and your wife, along with your sons and their wives. Bring
out all the living creatures that are with you—birds, livestock,
and everything that crawls upon the ground—so that they can spread
out over the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Noah came out, along with his sons and
his wife and his sons’ wives. Every living creature, every creeping
thing, and every bird—everything that moves upon the earth—came
out of the ark, kind by kind. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Noah built an altar to the LORD. And
taking from every kind of clean animal and clean bird, he offered
burnt offerings on the altar. When the LORD smelled the pleasing
aroma, He said in His heart, “Never again will I curse the ground
because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil
from his youth. And never again will I destroy all living creatures
as I have done. </font>
