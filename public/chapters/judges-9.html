<font ><b>Abimelech’s Conspiracy</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to his
mother’s brothers at Shechem and said to them and to all the clan
of his mother, “Please ask all the leaders of Shechem, ‘Is it
better for you that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over
you, or just one man?’ Remember that I am your own flesh and
blood.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when his mother’s brothers spoke all
these words about him in the presence of all the leaders of Shechem,
their hearts were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He
is our brother.” So they gave him seventy shekels of silver from
the temple of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired some worthless
and reckless men to follow him. He went to his father’s house in
Ophrah, and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of
Jerubbaal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived,
because he hid himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then all the leaders of Shechem and
Beth-millo gathered beside the oak at the pillar in Shechem and
proceeded to make Abimelech their king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When this was reported to Jotham, he
climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim, raised his voice, and cried out:
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Listen to me, O leaders of Shechem, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and may God listen to you. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >One day the trees set out </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >to anoint a king for themselves. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >They said to the olive tree, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Reign over us.’ </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >But the olive tree replied, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Should I stop giving my oil </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >that honors both God and man, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >to hold sway over the trees?’ </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Then the trees said to the fig tree, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Come and reign over us.’ </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >But the fig tree replied, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Should I stop giving my sweetness </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and my good fruit, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >to hold sway over the trees?’ </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Then the trees said to the grapevine, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Come and reign over us.’ </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >But the grapevine replied, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Should I stop giving my wine </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >that cheers both God and man, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >to hold sway over the trees?’ </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >Finally all the trees said to the
thornbush, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >Come and reign over us.’ </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >But the thornbush replied, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >If you really are anointing me as king
over you, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >come and find refuge in my shade. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >But if not, may fire come out of the
thornbush </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and consume the cedars of Lebanon.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if you have acted faithfully and
honestly in making Abimelech king, if you have done well by Jerubbaal
and his family, and if you have done to him as he deserves— for my
father fought for you and risked his life to deliver you from the
hand of Midian, but you have risen up against my father’s house
this day and killed his seventy sons on a single stone, and you have
made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the leaders of
Shechem because he is your brother— if you have acted faithfully
and honestly toward Jerubbaal and his house this day, then may you
rejoice in Abimelech, and he in you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if not, may fire come from Abimelech
and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo, and may fire come
from the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo and consume Abimelech.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jotham ran away, escaping to Beer,
and he lived there for fear of his brother Abimelech. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Abimelech had reigned over Israel
for three years, God sent a spirit of animosity between Abimelech and
the leaders of Shechem and caused them to treat Abimelech
deceitfully, in order that the crime against the seventy sons of
Jerubbaal might come to justice and their blood be avenged on their
brother Abimelech and on the leaders of Shechem, who had helped him
murder his brothers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The leaders of Shechem set up an ambush
against Abimelech on the hilltops, and they robbed all who passed by
them on the road. So this was reported to Abimelech. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile, Gaal son of Ebed came with his
brothers and crossed into Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem put
their confidence in him. And after they had gone out into the fields,
gathered grapes from their vineyards, and trodden them, they held a
festival and went into the house of their god; and as they ate and
drank, they cursed Abimelech. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is
Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not
the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? You are to serve
the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem. Why should we serve
Abimelech? If only this people were under my authority, I would
remove Abimelech; I would say to him, ‘Muster your army and come
out!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Zebul the governor of the city heard
the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he burned with anger. So he covertly
sent messengers to Abimelech to say, “Look, Gaal son of Ebed and
his brothers have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city
against you. Now then, tonight you and the people with you are to
come and lie in wait in the fields. And in the morning at sunrise,
get up and advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out
against you, do to them whatever you are able.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Abimelech and all his troops set out by
night and lay in wait against Shechem in four companies. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at
the entrance of the city gate just as Abimelech and his men came out
from their hiding places. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Gaal saw the people, he said to
Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the mountains!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Zebul replied, “The shadows of the
mountains look like men to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Gaal spoke up again, “Look, people
are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is
coming by way of the Diviners’ Oak.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Where is your gloating now?” Zebul
replied. “You said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’
Are these not the people you ridiculed? Go out now and fight them!”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Gaal went out before the leaders of
Shechem and fought against Abimelech, but Abimelech pursued him, and
Gaal fled before him. And many Shechemites fell wounded all the way
to the entrance of the gate. Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and Zebul
drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day the people of Shechem went
out into the fields, and this was reported to Abimelech. So he took
his men, divided them into three companies, and lay in wait in the
fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose up
against them and attacked them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Abimelech and the companies with him
rushed forward and took their stand at the entrance of the city gate.
The other two companies rushed against all who were in the fields and
struck them down. And all that day Abimelech fought against the city
until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he demolished
the city and sowed it with salt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On hearing of this, all the leaders in the
tower of Shechem entered the inner chamber of the temple of
El-berith. And when Abimelech was told that all the leaders in the
tower of Shechem were gathered there, he and all his men went up to
Mount Zalmon. Abimelech took his axe in his hand and cut a branch
from the trees, which he lifted to his shoulder, saying to his men,
“Hurry and do what you have seen me do.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So each man also cut his own branch and
followed Abimelech. Then they piled the branches against the inner
chamber and set it on fire above them, killing everyone in the tower
of Shechem, about a thousand men and women. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Abimelech went to Thebez, encamped
against it, and captured it. But there was a strong tower inside the
city, and all the men, women, and leaders of the city fled there.
They locked themselves in and went up to the roof of the tower. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Abimelech came to attack the tower,
he approached its entrance to set it on fire. But a woman dropped an
upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, crushing his skull. He quickly
called his armor-bearer, saying, “Draw your sword and kill me, lest
they say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Abimelech’s armor-bearer ran his
sword through him, and he died. And when the Israelites saw that
Abimelech was dead, they all went home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In this way God repaid the wickedness that
Abimelech had done to his father in murdering his seventy brothers.
And God also brought all the wickedness of the men of Shechem back
upon their own heads. So the curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal came
upon them. </font>
