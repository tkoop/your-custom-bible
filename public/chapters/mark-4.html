<font ><b>The Parables of Jesus</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once again Jesus began to teach beside the
sea, and such a large crowd gathered around Him that He got into a
boat and sat in it, while all the people crowded along the shore. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And He taught them many things in
parables, and in His teaching He said, <font color="#a80000">“Listen!
A farmer went out to sow his seed. And as he was sowing, some seed
fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Some fell on rocky
ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because
the soil was shallow. But when the sun rose, the seedlings were
scorched, and they withered because they had no root. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Other seed fell
among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings, and they
yielded no crop. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Still other seed
fell on good soil, where it sprouted, grew up, and produced a
crop—one bearing thirtyfold, another sixtyfold, and another a
hundredfold.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“He
who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As soon as Jesus was alone with the Twelve
and those around Him, they asked Him about the parable. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He replied, <font color="#a80000">“The
mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those on
the outside everything is expressed in parables, so that,</font> </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >they may be ever
seeing but never perceiving, </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >and ever hearing but
never understanding; </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >otherwise they might
turn </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >and be forgiven.’”
</font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Do
you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand any of
the parables?</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The farmer sows the
word. Some are like the seeds along the path, where the word is sown.
As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was
sown in them. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Some are like the
seeds sown on rocky ground. They hear the word and at once receive it
with joy. But they themselves have no root, and they remain for only
a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they
quickly fall away. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Others are like the
seeds sown among the thorns. They hear the word, but the worries of
this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desire for other
things come in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Still others are
like the seeds sown on good soil. They hear the word, receive it, and
produce a crop—thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus also said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Does
anyone bring in a lamp to put it under a basket or under a bed?
Doesn’t he set it on a stand? For there is nothing hidden that will
not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be brought to
light.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >If anyone has ears
to hear, let him hear.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He went on to say, <font color="#a80000">“Pay
attention to what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be
measured to you, and even more will be added to you. For whoever has
will be given more. But whoever does not have, even what he has will
be taken away from him.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus also said, <font color="#a80000">“The
kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground. Night
and day he sleeps and wakes, and the seed sprouts and grows, though
he knows not how. All by itself the earth produces a crop—first the
stalk, then the head, then grain that ripens within. And as soon as
the grain is ripe, he swings the sickle, because the harvest has
come.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He asked, <font color="#a80000">“To
what can we compare the kingdom of God? With what parable shall we
present it? It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all
seeds sown upon the earth. But after it is planted, it grows to be
the largest of all garden plants and puts forth great branches, so
that the birds of the air nest in its shade.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >With many such parables Jesus spoke the
word to them, to the extent that they could understand. He did not
tell them anything without using a parable. But privately He
explained everything to His own disciples. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When that evening came, He said to His
disciples, <font color="#a80000">“Let us cross to the other side.”</font>
After they had dismissed the crowd, they took Jesus with them, since
He was already in the boat. And there were other boats with Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Soon a violent windstorm came up, and the
waves were breaking over the boat, so that it was being swamped. But
Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. So they woke Him and
said, “Teacher, don’t You care that we are perishing?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and
the sea. <font color="#a80000">“Silence!”</font> He commanded.
<font color="#a80000">“Be still!”</font> And the wind died down,
and it was perfectly calm. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Why are you so
afraid?”</font> He asked. <font color="#a80000">“Do you still
have no faith?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Overwhelmed with fear, they asked one
another, “Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?” </font>
