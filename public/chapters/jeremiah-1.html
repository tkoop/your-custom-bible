<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Call of Jeremiah</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>These are the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests in Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah,
<span class="reftext">3</span>and through the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, until the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>The word of the LORD came to me, saying:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, </p><p class="indent"> and before you were born I set you apart </p><p class="indent"> and appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>“Ah, Lord GOD,” I said, “I surely do not know how to speak, for I am only a child!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>But the LORD told me: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Do not say, </p><p class="indent">‘I am only a child.’ </p><p class="indent1"> For to everyone I send you, </p><p class="indent"> you must go, </p><p class="indent1"> and all that I command you, </p><p class="indent"> you must speak.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Do not be afraid of them, </p><p class="indent"> for I am with you to deliver you,” </p><p class="selah"> declares the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then the LORD reached out His hand, touched my mouth, and said to me: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Behold, I have put My words </p><p class="indent"> in your mouth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>See, I have appointed you today </p><p class="indent"> over nations and kingdoms </p><p class="indent1"> to uproot and tear down, </p><p class="indent"> to destroy and overthrow, </p><p class="indent"> to build and plant.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And the word of the LORD came to me, asking, “Jeremiah, what do you see?” </p><p class="reg1">“I see a branch of an almond tree,” I replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“You have observed correctly,” said the LORD, “for I am watching<span class="fn">a</span>  over My word to accomplish it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Again the word of the LORD came to me, asking, “What do you see?” </p><p class="reg1">“I see a boiling pot,” I replied, “and it is tilting toward us from the north.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then the LORD said to me, “Disaster from the north will be poured out on all who live in the land.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For I am about to summon all the clans and kingdoms of the north,” declares the LORD. </p><p class="indent1stline">“Their kings will come and set up their thrones </p><p class="indent"> at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem. </p><p class="indent1"> They will attack all her surrounding walls </p><p class="indent"> and all the other cities of Judah.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>I will pronounce My judgments against them </p><p class="indent"> for all their wickedness, </p><p class="indent1"> because they have forsaken Me </p><p class="indent"> to burn incense to other gods </p><p class="indent"> and to worship the works of their own hands.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Get yourself ready.<span class="fn">b</span>  Stand up and tell them everything that I command you. Do not be intimidated by them, or I will terrify you before them.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Now behold, this day I have made you like a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.
<span class="reftext">19</span>They will fight against you but will never overcome you, since I am with you to deliver you,” declares the LORD.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> The Hebrew for <i class="calibre6">watching</i> sounds like the Hebrew for <i class="calibre6">almond tree</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Gird up your loins.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
