<span class="reftext">2</span>And some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria, where Ahab sacrificed many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him, and urged him to march up to Ramoth-gilead.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?” </p><p class="reg1"> And Jehoshaphat replied, “I am like you, and my people are your people; we will join you in the war.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men, and asked them, “Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?” </p><p class="reg1">“Go up,” they replied, “and God will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not still a prophet of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> here of whom we can inquire?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>The king of Israel answered, “There is still one man who can ask <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me, but only bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” </p><p class="reg1">“The king should not say that!” Jehoshaphat replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Dressed in royal attire, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for himself iron horns and declared, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘With these you shall gore the Arameans until they are finished off.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And all the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will deliver it into the hand of the king.”
</p><p class="hdg">Micaiah Prophesies against Ahab<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Kings 22:13–28)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah instructed him, “Behold, with one accord the words of the prophets are favorable to the king. So please let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But Micaiah said, “As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives, I will speak whatever my God tells me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?” </p><p class="reg1">“Go up and triumph,” Micaiah replied, “for they will be given into your hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So Micaiah declared: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I saw all Israel scattered on the hills </p><p class="indent"> like sheep without a shepherd. </p><p class="indent1"> And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, ‘These people have no master; </p><p class="indent"> let each one return home in peace.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for me, but only bad?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>: I saw <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ </p><p class="reg1"> And one suggested this, and another that.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then a spirit came forward, stood before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ </p><p class="reg1">‘By what means?’ asked <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>And he replied, ‘I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ </p><p class="reg1">‘You will surely entice him and prevail,’ said <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. ‘Go and do it.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So you see, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has pronounced disaster against you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up, struck Micaiah in the face, and demanded, “Which way did the Spirit of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> go when He departed from me to speak with you?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Micaiah replied, “You will soon see, on that day when you go and hide in an inner room.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>And the king of Israel declared, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son,
<span class="reftext">26</span>and tell them that this is what the king says: ‘Put this man in prison and feed him only bread and water until I return safely.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>But Micaiah replied, “If you ever return safely, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Take heed, all you people!”
</p><p class="hdg">Ahab’s Defeat and Death<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Kings 22:29–40)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
<span class="reftext">29</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “This is the king of Israel!” So they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> helped him. God drew them away from him.
<span class="reftext">32</span>And when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>However, a certain man drew his bow without taking special aim, and he struck the king of Israel between the joints of his <span class='spell ca'>armour</span><span class='spell gb'>armour</span><span class='spell us'>armor</span>. So the king said to his charioteer, “Turn around<span class="fn">a</span>  and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>The battle raged throughout that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. And at sunset he died.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Turn your hand</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
