Chronicles 18</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Ahab’s Defeat and Death</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in
abundance, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage. And some
years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria, where Ahab
sacrificed many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him, and
urged him to march up to Ramoth-gilead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king
of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth-gilead?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Jehoshaphat replied, “I am like you,
and my people are your people; we will join you in the war.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of
Israel, “Please inquire first for the word of the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king of Israel assembled the
prophets, four hundred men, and asked them, “Should we go to war
against Ramoth-gilead, or should we refrain?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go up,” they replied, “and God will
deliver it into the hand of the king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not
still a prophet of the LORD here of whom we can inquire?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king of Israel answered, “There is
still one man who can ask the LORD, but I hate him because he never
prophesies anything good for me, but only bad. He is Micaiah son of
Imlah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king should not say that!”
Jehoshaphat replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king of Israel called one of his
officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Dressed in royal attire, the king of
Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at
the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all
the prophets prophesying before them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Zedekiah son of Chenaanah had made for
himself iron horns and declared, “This is what the LORD says: ‘With
these you shall gore the Arameans until they are finished off.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And all the prophets were prophesying the
same, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the LORD
will deliver it into the hand of the king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the messenger who had gone to call
Micaiah instructed him, “Behold, with one accord the words of the
prophets are favorable to the king. So please let your words be like
theirs, and speak favorably.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Micaiah said, “As surely as the LORD
lives, I will speak whatever my God tells me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Micaiah arrived, the king asked him,
“Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we
refrain?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Go up and triumph,” Micaiah replied,
“for they will be given into your hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the king said to him, “How many
times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in
the name of the LORD?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Micaiah declared: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I saw all Israel scattered on the hills
</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">like sheep without a shepherd. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD said, ‘These people have no
master; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">let each one return home in peace.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font face="Tahoma, serif"> </font></font><font face="Tahoma, serif">”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he never prophesies good for
me, but only bad?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the
word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the
host of heaven standing on His right and on His left. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the LORD said, ‘Who will entice Ahab
king of Israel to march up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And one suggested this, and another that. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then a spirit came forward, stood before
the LORD, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">By what means?’ asked the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And he replied, ‘I will go out and be a
lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">You will surely entice him and
prevail,’ said the LORD. ‘Go and do it.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So you see, the LORD has put a lying
spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours, and the LORD has
pronounced disaster against you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went up,
struck Micaiah in the face, and demanded, “Which way did the Spirit
of the LORD go when He departed from me to speak with you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Micaiah replied, “You will soon see, on
that day when you go and hide in an inner room.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the king of Israel declared, “Take
Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash
the king’s son, and tell them that this is what the king says: ‘Put
this man in prison and feed him only bread and water until I return
safely.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Micaiah replied, “If you ever return
safely, the LORD has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Take
heed, all you people!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king
of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. And the king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you
wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and
went into battle. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the king of Aram had ordered his
chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great,
except the king of Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the chariot commanders saw
Jehoshaphat, they said, “This is the king of Israel!” So they
turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD
helped him. God drew them away from him. And when the chariot
commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back
from pursuing him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">However, a certain man drew his bow
without taking special aim, and he struck the king of Israel between
the joints of his armor. So the king said to his charioteer, “Turn
around and take me out of the battle, for I am badly wounded!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The battle raged throughout that day, and
the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the
Arameans until evening. And at sunset he died. </font>
