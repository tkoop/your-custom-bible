<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now David summoned all the leaders of
Israel to Jerusalem: the leaders of the tribes, the leaders of the
divisions in the king’s service, the commanders of thousands and of
hundreds, and the officials in charge of all the property and cattle
of the king and his sons, along with the court officials and mighty
men—every mighty man of valor. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King David rose to his feet and said,
“Listen to me, my brothers and my people. It was in my heart to
build a house as a resting place for the ark of the covenant of the
LORD and as a footstool for our God. I had made preparations to build
it, but God said to me, ‘You are not to build a house for My Name,
because you are a man of war who has spilled blood.’ </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Yet the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me
out of all my father’s house to be king over Israel forever. For He
chose Judah as leader, and from the house of Judah He chose my
father’s household, and from my father’s sons He was pleased to
make me king over all Israel. And of all my sons—for the LORD has
given me many sons—He has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the
throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. And He said to me,
‘Solomon your son is the one who will build My house and My courts,
for I have chosen him as My son, and I will be his Father. I will
establish his kingdom forever, if he resolutely carries out My
commandments and ordinances, as is being done this day.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So now in the sight of all Israel, the
assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, keep and seek
out all the commandments of the LORD your God, so that you may
possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your
descendants forever. As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your
father and serve Him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind, for the
LORD searches every heart and understands the intent of every
thought. If you seek Him, He will be found by you; but if you forsake
Him, He will reject you forever. Consider now that the LORD has
chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong and do it.”

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David gave his son Solomon the plans
for the portico of the temple, its buildings, storehouses, upper
rooms, inner rooms, and the room for the mercy seat. The plans
contained everything David had in mind for the courts of the house of
the LORD, for all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the
house of God and of the dedicated things, for the divisions of the
priests and Levites, for all the work of service in the house of the
LORD, and for all the articles of service in the house of the LORD: </font>
