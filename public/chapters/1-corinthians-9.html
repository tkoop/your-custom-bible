<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Rights of an Apostle<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 18:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> yourselves not my workmanship in the Lord?
<span class="reftext">2</span>Even if I am not an apostle to others, surely I am to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. For <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>This is my <span class='spell ca'>defence</span><span class='spell gb'>defence</span><span class='spell us'>defense</span> to those who <span class='spell ca'>scrutinize</span><span class='spell gb'>scrutinise</span><span class='spell us'>scrutinize</span> me:
<span class="reftext">4</span>Have we no right to food and to drink?
<span class="reftext">5</span>Have we no right to take along a believing wife,<span class="fn">a</span>  as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas?<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Or are Barnabas and I the only apostles who must work for a living?<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not drink of its milk?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Do I say this from a human perspective? Doesn’t the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> say the same thing?
<span class="reftext">9</span>For it is written in the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.”<span class="fn">d</span>  Is it about oxen that God is concerned?
<span class="reftext">10</span>Isn’t <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> actually speaking on our behalf? Indeed, this was written for us, because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes, they should also expect to share in the harvest.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>If we have sown spiritual seed among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, is it too much for us to reap a material harvest from <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>?
<span class="reftext">12</span>If others have this right to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> support, shouldn’t we have it all the more? But we did not exercise this right. Instead, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not know that those who work in the temple eat of its food, and those who serve at the altar partake of its offerings?
<span class="reftext">14</span>In the same way, the Lord has prescribed that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.
<span class="reftext">15</span>But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this to suggest that something be done for me. Indeed, I would rather die than let anyone nullify my boast.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Yet when I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because I am obligated to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
<span class="reftext">17</span>If my preaching is voluntary, I have a reward. But if it is not voluntary, I am still entrusted with a responsibility.
<span class="reftext">18</span>What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not use up my rights in preaching it.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul the Servant to All</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Though I am free of obligation to anyone, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.
<span class="reftext">20</span>To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), to win those under the law.
<span class="reftext">21</span>To those without the law I became like one without the law (though I am not outside the law of God but am under the law of Christ), to win those without the law.
<span class="reftext">22</span>To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>I do all this for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings.
</p><p class="hdg">Run Your Race to Win</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way as to take the prize.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Everyone who competes in the games trains with strict discipline. They do it for a crown that is perishable, but we do it for a crown that is imperishable.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Therefore I do not run aimlessly; I do not fight like I am beating the air.
<span class="reftext">27</span>No, I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">take along a sister—a wife—</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, Peter<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Or is it only Barnabas and I who do not have authority not to work?</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Deuteronomy 25:4<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
