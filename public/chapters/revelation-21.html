“Behold, I make all things new.” Then He said, “Write this
down, for these words are faithful and true.” And He told me, “It
is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To

coming down out of heaven from God, shining with the glory of God.
Its radiance was like a most precious jewel, like a jasper, as clear
as crystal. The city had a great and high wall with twelve gates
inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and twelve
angels at the gates. There were three gates on the east, three on the
north, three on the south, and three on the west. The wall of the

of the Lamb. </font>

lies foursquare, with its width the same as its length. And he
measured the city with the rod, and all its dimensions were
equal—12,000 stadia in length and width and height. And he measured
its wall to be 144 cubits, by the human measure the angel was using. </font>
