<span class="reftext">2</span>I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man, </p><p class="indent"> and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> will dwell with them. </p><p class="indent1"> They will be <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> people, </p><p class="indent"> and God <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span><span class='bsb'>Himself</span> will be with them as their God.<span class="fn">b</span>

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> seated on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said, “Write this down, for these words are faithful and true.”
<span class="reftext">6</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> told me, “It is done! I am the <span class='cap'>Alpha</span><span class='nocap'>alpha</span><span class='bsb'>Alpha</span> and the <span class='cap'>Omega</span><span class='nocap'>omega</span><span class='bsb'>Omega</span>, the <span class='cap'>Beginning</span><span class='nocap'>beginning</span><span class='bsb'>Beginning</span> and the <span class='cap'>End</span><span class='nocap'>end</span><span class='bsb'>End</span>. To the thirsty I will give freely from the spring of the water of life.
<span class="reftext">7</span>The one who overcomes will inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he will be <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> son.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>But to the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and sexually immoral and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and <span class='spell ca'>sulphur</span><span class='spell gb'>sulphur</span><span class='spell us'>sulfur</span>. This is the second death.”
</p><p class="hdg">The New Jerusalem</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then one of the seven angels with the seven bowls full of the seven final plagues came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the <span class='cap'>Lamb</span><span class='nocap'>lamb</span><span class='bsb'>Lamb</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And he carried me away in the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> to a mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city of Jerusalem coming down out of <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> from God,
<span class="reftext">11</span>shining with the glory of God. Its radiance was like a most precious jewel, like a jasper, as clear as crystal.
<span class="reftext">12</span>The city had a great and high wall with twelve gates inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and twelve angels at the gates.
<span class="reftext">13</span>There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west.
<span class="reftext">14</span>The wall of the city had twelve foundations bearing the names of the twelve apostles of the <span class='cap'>Lamb</span><span class='nocap'>lamb</span><span class='bsb'>Lamb</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The angel who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod to measure the city and its gates and walls.
<span class="reftext">16</span>The city lies foursquare, with its width the same as its length. And he measured the city with the rod, and all its dimensions were equal—12,000 stadia<span class="fn">d</span>  in length and width and height.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he measured its wall to be 144 cubits,<span class="fn">e</span>  by the human measure the angel was using.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>The wall was made of jasper, and the city itself of pure gold, as pure as glass.
<span class="reftext">19</span>The foundations of the city walls were adorned with every kind of precious stone: </p><p class="list1stline"> The first foundation was jasper, </p><p class="list1stline"> the second sapphire, </p><p class="list1stline"> the third chalcedony, </p><p class="list1stline"> the fourth emerald,

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, with each gate consisting of a single pearl. The main street of the city was pure gold, as clear as glass.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But I saw no temple in the city, because the Lord God <span class='cap'>Almighty</span><span class='nocap'>almighty</span><span class='bsb'>Almighty</span> and the <span class='cap'>Lamb</span><span class='nocap'>lamb</span><span class='bsb'>Lamb</span> are its temple.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, because the glory of God illuminates the city, and the <span class='cap'>Lamb</span><span class='nocap'>lamb</span><span class='bsb'>Lamb</span> is its lamp.
<span class="reftext">24</span>By its light the nations will walk, and into it the kings of the earth will bring their glory.<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Its gates will never be shut at the end of the day, because there will be no night there.
