<font >Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
for the first heaven and earth had passed away, and the sea was no
more. I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of
heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And I heard a loud voice from the throne
saying: </font>

“<font >Behold, the dwelling place of God is

<font >And the One seated on the throne said,
“Behold, I make all things new.” Then He said, “Write this
down, for these words are faithful and true.” And He told me, “It
is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To
the thirsty I will give freely from the spring of the water of life.
The one who overcomes will inherit all things, and I will be his God,
and he will be My son. </font>

<font >And he carried me away in the Spirit to a
mountain great and high, and showed me the holy city of Jerusalem
coming down out of heaven from God, shining with the glory of God.
Its radiance was like a most precious jewel, like a jasper, as clear
as crystal. The city had a great and high wall with twelve gates
inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and twelve
angels at the gates. There were three gates on the east, three on the
north, three on the south, and three on the west. The wall of the
city had twelve foundations bearing the names of the twelve apostles
of the Lamb. </font>

<font >The angel who spoke with me had a golden
measuring rod to measure the city and its gates and walls. The city
lies foursquare, with its width the same as its length. And he
measured the city with the rod, and all its dimensions were
equal—12,000 stadia in length and width and height. And he measured
its wall to be 144 cubits, by the human measure the angel was using. </font>
