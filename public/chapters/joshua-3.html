<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Crossing the Jordan</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Early the next morning Joshua got up and left Shittim<span class="fn">a</span>  with all the Israelites. They went as far as the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>After three days the officers went through the camp
<span class="reftext">3</span>and commanded the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God being carried by the Levitical priests, you are to set out from your positions and follow it.
<span class="reftext">4</span>But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits<span class="fn">b</span>  between yourselves and the ark. Do not go near it, so that you can see the way to go, since you have never <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> this way before.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will do wonders among you.”
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he said to the priests, “Take the ark of the covenant and go on ahead of the people.” So they carried the ark of the covenant and went ahead of them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you just as I was with Moses.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the waters, stand in the Jordan.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So Joshua told the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.”
<span class="reftext">10</span>He continued, “This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will surely drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go ahead of you into the Jordan.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.
<span class="reftext">13</span>When the feet of the priests who carry the ark of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>—the Lord of all the earth—touch down in the waters of the Jordan, its flowing waters will be cut off and will stand up in a heap.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest season. But as soon as the priests carrying the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water’s edge,
<span class="reftext">16</span>the flowing water stood still. It backed up as far upstream as Adam, a city in the area of Zarethan, while the water flowing toward the <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span> of the Arabah (the <span class='cap'>Salt</span><span class='nocap'>salt</span> <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span><span class="fn">c</span>) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.
<span class="reftext">17</span>The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel crossed over the dry ground, until the entire nation had crossed the Jordan.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Acacia Grove</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">2,000 cubits</i> is approximately 3,000 feet or 914.4 meters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, the Dead Sea<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
