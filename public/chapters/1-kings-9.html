<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The LORD’s Response to Solomon<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 7:11–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now when Solomon had finished building the house of the LORD and the royal palace, and had achieved all that he had desired to do,
<span class="reftext">2</span>the LORD appeared to him a second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And the LORD said to him: </p><p class="tab1stline">“I have heard your prayer and petition before Me. I have consecrated this temple you have built by putting My Name there forever; My eyes and My heart will be there for all time.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>And as for you, if you walk before Me as your father David walked, with a heart of integrity and uprightness, doing all I have commanded you, and if you keep My statutes and ordinances,
<span class="reftext">5</span>then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised your father David when I said, ‘You will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.’
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>But if indeed you or your sons turn away from following Me and do not keep the commandments and statutes I have set before you, and if you go off to serve and worship other gods,
<span class="reftext">7</span>then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them, and I will banish from My presence this temple I have sanctified for My Name. Then Israel will become an object of scorn and ridicule among all peoples.
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>And when this temple has become a heap of rubble,<span class="fn">a</span>  all who pass by it will be appalled and will hiss and say, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’
<span class="reftext">9</span>And others will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the LORD their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—because of this, the LORD has brought all this disaster upon them.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">Solomon’s Additional Achievements<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Chronicles 8:1–18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now at the end of the twenty years during which Solomon built these two houses, the house of the LORD and the royal palace,
<span class="reftext">11</span>King Solomon gave twenty towns in the land of Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, who had supplied him with cedar and cypress<span class="fn">b</span>  logs and gold for his every desire.
<span class="reftext">12</span>So Hiram went out from Tyre to inspect the towns that Solomon had given him, but he was not pleased with them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>“What are these towns you have given me, my brother?” asked Hiram, and he called them the Land of Cabul,<span class="fn">c</span>  as they are called to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And Hiram had sent the king 120 talents of gold.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>This is the account of the forced labour that King Solomon imposed to build the house of the LORD, his own palace, the supporting terraces,<span class="fn">e</span>  and the wall of Jerusalem, as well as Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.
<span class="reftext">17</span>So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, Lower Beth-horon,
<span class="reftext">18</span>Baalath, and Tamar<span class="fn">f</span>  in the Wilderness of Judah,<span class="fn">g</span> 
<span class="reftext">19</span>as well as all the store cities that Solomon had for his chariots and horses<span class="fn">h</span> —whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and throughout the land of his dominion.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>As for all the people who remained of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites (the people who were not Israelites)—
<span class="reftext">21</span>their descendants who remained in the land, those whom the Israelites were unable to devote to destruction<span class="fn">i</span>—Solomon conscripted these people to be forced labourers, as they are to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>But Solomon did not consign any of the Israelites to slavery, because they were his men of war, his servants, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and cavalry.
<span class="reftext">23</span>They were also the chief officers over Solomon’s projects: 550 supervisors over the people who did the work.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace that Solomon had built for her, he built the supporting terraces.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense with them before the LORD. So he completed the temple.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>King Solomon also assembled a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth<span class="fn">j</span>  in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.<span class="fn">k</span> 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And Hiram sent his servants, men who knew the sea, to serve in the fleet with Solomon’s servants.
<span class="reftext">28</span>They sailed to Ophir and imported gold from there—420 talents<span class="fn">l</span>—and delivered it to Solomon.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Some LXX manuscripts, Syriac, and Arabic; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">And though this temple is now exalted</i>; see also 2 Chronicles 7:21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">pine</i> or <i class="calibre6">juniper</i> or <i class="calibre6">fir</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Cabul</i> sounds like the Hebrew for <i class="calibre6">good-for-nothing</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">120 talents</i> is approximately 4.52 tons or 4.1 metric tons of gold.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the Millo</i>; also in verse 24<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Alternate MT reading; the other alternate reads <i class="calibre6">Tadmor</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">in the wilderness in the land</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">horsemen</i> or <i class="calibre6">charioteers</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">cherem</i> refer to the giving over of things or persons to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> <i class="calibre6">Eloth</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Elath</i>; see LXX, 2 Kings 14:22, and 2 Kings 16:6.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Sea of Reeds</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> <i class="calibre6">420 talents</i> is approximately 15.8 tons or 14.4 metric tons of gold.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
