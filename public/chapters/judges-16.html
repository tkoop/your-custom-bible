<font ><b>Samson and Delilah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw
a prostitute and went in to spend the night with her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Gazites heard that Samson was
there, they surrounded that place and lay in wait for him all night
at the city gate. They were quiet throughout the night, saying, “Let
us wait until dawn; then we will kill him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Samson lay there only until midnight,
when he got up, took hold of the doors of the city gate and both
gateposts, and pulled them out, bar and all. Then he put them on his
shoulders and took them to the top of the mountain overlooking
Hebron. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some time later, Samson fell in love with
a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. The lords of
the Philistines went to her and said, “Entice him and find out the
source of his great strength and how we can overpower him to tie him
up and subdue him. Then each one of us will give you eleven hundred
shekels of silver.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell
me the source of your great strength and how you can be tied up and
subdued.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Samson told her, “If they tie me up with
seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I will become as
weak as any other man.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the lords of the Philistines brought
her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied him
up with them. While the men were hidden in her room, she called out,
“Samson, the Philistines are here!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But he snapped the bowstrings like a
strand of yarn seared by a flame. So the source of his strength
remained unknown. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have
mocked me and lied to me! Now please tell me how you can be tied up.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He replied, “If they tie me up with new
ropes that have never been used, I will become as weak as any other
man.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Delilah took new ropes, tied him up
with them, and called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But while the men were hidden in her room,
he snapped the ropes off his arms like they were threads. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have
mocked me and lied to me all along! Tell me how you can be tied up.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He told her, “If you weave the seven
braids of my head into the web of a loom and tighten it with a pin, I
will become as weak as any other man.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So while he slept, Delilah took the seven
braids of his hair and wove them into the web. Then she tightened it
with a pin and called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are here!”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But he awoke from his sleep and pulled out
the pin with the loom and the web. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >How can you say, ‘I love you,’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
she asked, “when your heart is not with me? This is the third time
you have mocked me and failed to reveal to me the source of your
great strength!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Finally, after she had pressed him daily
with her words and pleaded until he was sick to death, Samson told
her all that was in his heart: “My hair has never been cut, because
I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am
shaved, my strength will leave me, and I will become as weak as any
other man.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Delilah realized that he had revealed
to her all that was in his heart, she sent this message to the lords
of the Philistines: “Come up once more, for he has revealed to me
all that is in his heart.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the lords of the Philistines came to
her, bringing the money in their hands. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And having lulled him to sleep on her lap,
she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his head. In this
way she began to subdue him, and his strength left him. Then she
called out, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Samson awoke from his sleep, he
thought, “I will escape as I did before and shake myself free.”
But he did not know that the LORD had departed from him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Philistines seized him, gouged
out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, where he was bound with
bronze shackles and forced to grind grain in the prison. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >However, the hair of his head began to
grow back after it had been shaved. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the lords of the Philistines gathered
together to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They rejoiced
and said, “Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hands.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when the people saw him, they praised
their god, saying: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Our god has delivered into our hands </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >our enemy who destroyed our land </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and multiplied our dead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And while their hearts were merry, they
said, “Call for Samson to entertain us.” So they called Samson
out of the prison to entertain them. And they stationed him between
the pillars. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Samson said to the servant who held his
hand, “Lead me where I can feel the pillars supporting the temple,
so I can lean against them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the temple was full of men and women;
all the lords of the Philistines were there, and about three thousand
men and women were on the roof watching Samson entertain them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Samson called out to the LORD: “O
Lord GOD, please remember me. Strengthen me, O God, just once more,
so that with one vengeful blow I may pay back the Philistines for my
two eyes.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Samson reached out for the two central
pillars supporting the temple. Bracing himself against them with his
right hand on one pillar and his left hand on the other, Samson said,
“Let me die with the Philistines.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he pushed with all his might, and the
temple fell on the lords and all the people in it. So in his death he
killed more than he had killed in his life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Samson’s brothers and his father’s
family came down, carried him back, and buried him between Zorah and
Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. And he had judged Israel
twenty years. </font>
