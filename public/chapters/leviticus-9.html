<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Aaron’s First Offerings</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
<span class="reftext">2</span>He said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and present them before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then speak to the Israelites and say, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb—both a year old and without blemish—for a burnt offering,
<span class="reftext">4</span>an ox<span class="fn">a</span>  and a ram for a peace offering to sacrifice before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will appear to you.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and the whole congregation drew near and stood before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Moses said, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has commanded you to do, so that the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> may appear to you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then Moses said to Aaron, “Approach the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering to make atonement for yourself and for the people. And sacrifice the people’s offering to make atonement for them, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has commanded.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.
<span class="reftext">9</span>The sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and applied it to the horns of the altar. And he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
<span class="reftext">10</span>On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded Moses.
<span class="reftext">11</span>But he burned up the flesh and the hide outside the camp.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Aaron slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar.
<span class="reftext">13</span>They brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar.
<span class="reftext">14</span>He washed the entrails and the legs and burned them atop the burnt offering on the altar.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Aaron then presented the people’s offering. He took the male goat for the people’s sin offering, slaughtered it, and offered it for sin like the first one.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>He presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Next he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram as the people’s peace offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of the altar.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>They also brought the fat portions from the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the fat covering the entrails, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver—
<span class="reftext">20</span>and placed these on the breasts. Aaron burned the fat portions on the altar,
<span class="reftext">21</span>but he waved the breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, as Moses had commanded.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having made the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering, he stepped down.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Moses and Aaron then entered the Tent of Meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> appeared to all the people.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Fire came out from the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a bull</i> or <i class="calibre6">a cow</i>; also in verses 18 and 19<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
