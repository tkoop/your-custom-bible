<font ><b>Aaron’s First Offerings</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and
his sons and the elders of Israel. He said to Aaron, “Take for
yourself a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt
offering, both without blemish, and present them before the LORD.
Then speak to the Israelites and say, ‘Take a male goat for a sin
offering, a calf and a lamb—both a year old and without blemish—for
a burnt offering, an ox and a ram for a peace offering to sacrifice
before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the
LORD will appear to you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they took what Moses had commanded to
the front of the Tent of Meeting, and the whole congregation drew
near and stood before the LORD. And Moses said, “This is what the
LORD has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may
appear to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses said to Aaron, “Approach the
altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering to make
atonement for yourself and for the people. And sacrifice the people’s
offering to make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Aaron approached the altar and
slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself. The sons of Aaron
brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and
applied it to the horns of the altar. And he poured out the rest of
the blood at the base of the altar. On the altar he burned the fat,
the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the
LORD had commanded Moses. But he burned up the flesh and the hide
outside the camp. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Aaron slaughtered the burnt offering.
His sons brought him the blood, and he sprinkled it on all sides of
the altar. They brought him the burnt offering piece by piece,
including the head, and he burned them on the altar. He washed the
entrails and the legs and burned them atop the burnt offering on the
altar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Aaron then presented the people’s
offering. He took the male goat for the people’s sin offering,
slaughtered it, and offered it for sin like the first one. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He presented the burnt offering and
offered it according to the ordinance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next he presented the grain offering, took
a handful of it, and burned it on the altar in addition to the
morning’s burnt offering. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram as
the people’s peace offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he
sprinkled it on all sides of the altar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They also brought the fat portions from
the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the fat covering the entrails, the
kidneys, and the lobe of the liver— and placed these on the
breasts. Aaron burned the fat portions on the altar, but he waved the
breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before the LORD, as
Moses had commanded. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Aaron lifted up his hands toward the
people and blessed them. And having made the sin offering, the burnt
offering, and the peace offering, he stepped down. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses and Aaron then entered the Tent of
Meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory
of the LORD appeared to all the people. Fire came out from the
presence of the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat
portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted
for joy and fell facedown. </font>
