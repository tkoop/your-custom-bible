<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Suddenly, as Jeroboam was standing beside
the altar to burn incense, there came a man of God from Judah to
Bethel by the word of the LORD. And he cried out against the altar by
the word of the LORD, “O altar, O altar, this is what the LORD
says: ‘A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David, and
upon you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn
incense upon you, and human bones will be burned upon you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">That day the man of God gave a sign,
saying, “The LORD has spoken this sign: ‘Surely the altar will be
split apart, and the ashes upon it will be poured out.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now when King Jeroboam, who was at the
altar in Bethel, heard the word that the man of God had cried out
against it, he stretched out his hand and said, “Seize him!” But
the hand he stretched out toward him withered, so that he could not
pull it back. And the altar was split apart, and the ashes poured
out, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word
of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king responded to the man of God,
“Intercede with the LORD your God and pray that my hand may be
restored.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the man of God interceded with the
LORD, and the king’s hand was restored to him as it was before. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king said to the man of God,
“Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a
reward.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the man of God replied, “If you were
to give me half your possessions, I still would not go with you, nor
would I eat bread or drink water in this place. For this is what I
was commanded by the word of the LORD: ‘You must not eat bread or
drink water or return by the way you came.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the man of God went another way and did
not return by the way he had come to Bethel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now a certain old prophet was living in
Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the deeds that the man of
God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the
words that the man had spoken to the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Which way did he go?” their father
asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And his sons showed him the way taken by
the man of God, who had come from Judah. So the prophet said to his
sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they saddled the donkey for him, and
he mounted it and went after the man of God. He found him sitting
under an oak tree and asked, “Are you the man of God who came from
Judah?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the prophet said to the man of God,
“Come home with me and eat some bread.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the man replied, “I cannot return
with you or eat bread or drink water with you in this place. For I
have been told by the word of the LORD: ‘You must not eat bread or
drink water there or return by the way you came.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the prophet replied, “I too am a
prophet like you, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD,
saying, ‘Bring him back with you to your house, so that he may eat
bread and drink water.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The old prophet was lying to him, but the
man of God went back with him, ate bread in his house, and drank
water. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While they were sitting at the table, the
word of the LORD came to the prophet who had brought him back, and
the prophet cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah,
“This is what the LORD says: ‘Because you have defied the word of
the LORD and have not kept the commandment that the LORD your God
gave you, but you went back and ate bread and drank water in the
place where He told you not to do so, your body shall never reach the
tomb of your fathers.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And after the man of God had finished
eating and drinking, the old prophet who had brought him back saddled
the donkey for him. As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road
and killed him, and his body was left lying in the road, with the
donkey and the lion standing beside it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And there were men passing by who saw the
body lying in the road with the lion standing beside it, and they
went and reported this in the city where the old prophet lived. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the prophet who had brought him back
from his journey heard this, he said, “It is the man of God who
disobeyed the command of the LORD. Therefore the LORD has delivered
him to the lion, and it has mauled him and killed him, according to
the word that the LORD had spoken to him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the old prophet instructed his sons,
“Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled it, and he went and
found the body lying in the road, with the donkey and the lion
standing beside it. The lion had not eaten the body or mauled the
donkey. So the old prophet lifted up the body of the man of God, laid
it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for
him and bury him. Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they
lamented over him, “Oh, my brother!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After he had buried him, the prophet said
to his sons, “When I die, you must bury me in the tomb where the
man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones, for the message
that he cried out by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel
and against all the shrines on the high places in the cities of
Samaria will surely come to pass.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Even after these events, Jeroboam did not
repent of his evil ways, but again he appointed priests for the high
places from every class of people. He ordained anyone who desired to
be a priest of the high places. And this was the sin of the house of
Jeroboam that led to its extermination and destruction from the face
of the earth. </font>
