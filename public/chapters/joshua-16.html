<font >The allotment for the descendants of
Joseph extended from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho
on the east, through the wilderness that goes up from Jericho into
the hill country of Bethel. It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz) and
proceeded to the border of the Archites in Ataroth. Then it descended
westward to the border of the Japhletites as far as the border of
Lower Beth-horon and on to Gezer, and it ended at the Sea. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of
Joseph, received their inheritance. This was the territory of the
descendants of Ephraim by their clans: </font>

<font >The border of their inheritance went from
Ataroth-addar in the east to Upper Beth-horon and out toward the Sea.
From Michmethath on the north it turned eastward toward
Taanath-shiloh and passed by it to Janoah on the east. From Janoah it
went down to Ataroth and Naarah, and then reached Jericho and came
out at the Jordan. From Tappuah the border went westward to the Brook
of Kanah and ended at the Sea. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This was the inheritance of the clans of
the tribe of Ephraim, along with all the cities and villages set
apart for the descendants of Ephraim within the inheritance of
Manasseh. But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in
Gezer. So the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites to this day, but
they are forced laborers. </font>
