</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Hear, O mountains, the LORD’s indictment, </p><p class="indent"> you enduring foundations of the earth. </p><p class="indent1"> For the LORD has a case against His people, </p><p class="indent"> and He will argue it against Israel:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>‘My people, what have I done to you? </p><p class="indent"> Testify against Me how I have wearied you!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>For I brought you up from the land of Egypt </p><p class="indent"> and redeemed you from the house of slavery. </p><p class="indent1"> I sent Moses before you, </p><p class="indent"> as well as Aaron and Miriam.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>My people, remember what Balak king of Moab counselled </p><p class="indent"> and what Balaam son of Beor answered. </p><p class="indent1"> Remember your journey from Shittim<span class="fn">a</span>  to Gilgal, </p><p class="indent"> so that you may acknowledge the righteousness of the LORD.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>With what shall I come before the LORD </p><p class="indent"> when I bow before the God on high? </p><p class="indent1"> Should I come to Him with burnt offerings, </p><p class="indent"> with year-old calves?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Would the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, </p><p class="indent"> with ten thousand rivers of oil? </p><p class="indent1"> Shall I present my firstborn for my transgression, </p><p class="indent"> the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>He has shown you, O man, what is good. </p><p class="indent"> And what does the LORD require of you </p><p class="indent1"> but to act justly, to love mercy, </p><p class="indent"> and to walk humbly with your God?
</p><p class="hdg">The Punishment of Israel</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>The voice of the LORD calls out to the city </p><p class="indent">(and it is sound wisdom to fear Your name): </p><p class="indent1">“Heed the rod </p><p class="indent"> and the One who ordained it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Can I forget any longer, </p><p class="indent"> O house of the wicked, </p><p class="indent1"> the treasures of wickedness </p><p class="indent"> and the short ephah, which is accursed?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Can I excuse dishonest scales </p><p class="indent"> or bags of false weights?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>For the wealthy of the city </p><p class="indent"> are full of violence, </p><p class="indent1"> and its residents speak lies; </p><p class="indent"> their tongues are deceitful in their mouths.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore I am striking you severely, </p><p class="indent"> to ruin you because of your sins.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>You will eat but not be satisfied, </p><p class="indent"> and your hunger will remain with you. </p><p class="indent1"> What you acquire, you will not preserve; </p><p class="indent"> and what you save, I will give to the sword.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>You will sow but not reap; </p><p class="indent"> you will press olives but not anoint yourselves with oil; </p><p class="indent"> you will tread grapes but not drink the wine.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>You have kept the statutes of Omri </p><p class="indent"> and all the practices of Ahab’s house; </p><p class="indent"> you have followed their counsel. </p><p class="indent1"> Therefore I will make you a desolation, </p><p class="indent"> and your inhabitants an object of contempt; </p><p class="indent"> you will bear the scorn of the nations.<span class="fn">b</span>”</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Acacia Grove</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">scorn of My people</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
