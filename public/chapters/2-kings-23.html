<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king summoned all the elders of
Judah and Jerusalem. And he went up to the house of the LORD with all
the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the priests and the
prophets—all the people small and great—and in their hearing he
read all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in
the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king stood by the pillar and made a
covenant before the LORD to follow the LORD and to keep His
commandments, decrees, and statutes with all his heart and all his
soul, and to carry out the words of this covenant that were written
in this book. And all the people entered into the covenant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high
priest, the priests second in rank, and the doorkeepers to remove
from the temple of the LORD all the articles made for Baal, Asherah,
and all the host of heaven. And he burned them outside Jerusalem in
the fields of Kidron and carried their ashes to Bethel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Josiah also did away with the idolatrous
priests ordained by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high
places of the cities of Judah and in the places all around
Jerusalem—those who had burned incense to Baal, to the sun and
moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He brought the Asherah pole from the house
of the LORD to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem, and there he
burned it, ground it to powder, and threw its dust on the graves of
the common people. He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine
prostitutes that were in the house of the LORD, where the women had
woven tapestries for Asherah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Josiah brought all the priests from
the cities of Judah and desecrated the high places, from Geba to
Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense. He tore down the
high places of the gates at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the
governor of the city, which was to the left of the city gate.
Although the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar
of the LORD in Jerusalem, they ate unleavened bread with their fellow
priests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He also desecrated Topheth in the Valley
of Ben-hinnom so that no one could sacrifice his son or daughter in
the fire to Molech. And he removed from the entrance to the house of
the LORD the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun.
They were in the court near the chamber of an official named
Nathan-melech. And Josiah burned up the chariots of the sun. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He pulled down the altars that the kings
of Judah had set up on the roof near the upper chamber of Ahaz, and
the altars that Manasseh had set up in the two courtyards of the
house of the LORD. The king pulverized them there and threw their
dust into the Kidron Valley. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king also desecrated the high places
east of Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Corruption, which
King Solomon of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the
Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for
Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. He smashed the sacred
pillars to pieces, cut down the Asherah poles, and covered the sites
with human bones. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He even pulled down the altar at Bethel,
the high place set up by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel
to sin. Then he burned the high place, ground it to powder, and
burned the Asherah pole. And as Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there
on the hillside, and he sent someone to take the bones out of the
tombs, and he burned them on the altar to defile it, according to the
word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God who had foretold these
things. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king asked, “What is this
monument I see?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the men of the city replied, “It is
the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced these
things that you have done to the altar of Bethel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Let him rest,” said Josiah. “Do not
let anyone disturb his bones.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they left his bones undisturbed, along
with those of the prophet who had come from Samaria. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Just as Josiah had done at Bethel, so also
in the cities of Samaria he removed all the shrines of the high
places set up by the kings of Israel who had provoked the LORD to
anger. On the altars he slaughtered all the priests of the high
places, and he burned human bones on them. Then he returned to
Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king commanded all the people, “Keep
the Passover of the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of
the Covenant.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">No such Passover had been observed from
the days of the judges who had governed Israel through all the days
of the kings of Israel and Judah. But in the eighteenth year of
Josiah’s reign, this Passover was observed to the LORD in
Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Furthermore, Josiah removed the mediums
and spiritists, the household gods and idols, and all the
abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. He
did this to carry out the words of the law written in the book that
Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Neither before nor after Josiah was there
any king like him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with
all his soul and with all his strength, according to all the Law of
Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nevertheless, the LORD did not turn away
from the fury of His burning anger, which was kindled against Judah
because of all that Manasseh had done to provoke Him to anger. For
the LORD had said, “I will remove Judah from My sight, just as I
removed Israel. I will reject this city Jerusalem, which I chose, and
the temple of which I said, ‘My Name shall be there.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As for the rest of the acts of Josiah,
along with all his accomplishments, are they not written in the Book
of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At the end of Josiah’s reign, Pharaoh
Neco king of Egypt marched up to help the king of Assyria at the
Euphrates River. King Josiah went out to confront him, but Neco faced
him and killed him at Megiddo. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">From Megiddo his servants carried his body
in a chariot, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own
tomb. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah,
anointed him, and made him king in place of his father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when
he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His
mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from
Libnah. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his fathers
had done. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Pharaoh Neco imprisoned Jehoahaz at
Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he could not reign in Jerusalem,
and he imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a
talent of gold. Then Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in
place of his father Josiah, and he changed Eliakim’s name to
Jehoiakim. But Neco took Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt, where
he died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Jehoiakim paid the silver and gold to
Pharaoh Neco, but to meet Pharaoh’s demand he taxed the land and
exacted the silver and the gold from the people, each according to
his wealth. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when
he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His
mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah.
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, just as his fathers had
done. </font>
