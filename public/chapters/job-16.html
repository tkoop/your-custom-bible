</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“I have heard many things like these; </p><p class="indent"> miserable comforters are you all.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Is there no end to your long-winded speeches? </p><p class="indent"> What provokes you to continue testifying?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>I could also speak like you </p><p class="indent"> if you were in my place; </p><p class="indent1"> I could heap up words against you </p><p class="indent"> and shake my head at you.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>But I would encourage you with my mouth, </p><p class="indent"> and the consolation of my lips would bring relief.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Even if I speak, my pain is not relieved, </p><p class="indent"> and if I hold back, how will it go away?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Surely <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has now exhausted me; </p><p class="indent"> You have devastated all my family.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>You have bound me, and it has become a witness; </p><p class="indent"> my frailty rises up and testifies against me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>His anger has torn me and opposed me; </p><p class="indent"> He gnashes <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> teeth at me. </p><p class="indent"> My adversary pierces me with <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> eyes.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>They open their mouths against me </p><p class="indent"> and strike my cheeks with contempt; </p><p class="indent"> they join together against me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>God has delivered me to unjust men; </p><p class="indent"> He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>I was at ease, but <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> shattered me; </p><p class="indent"> He seized me by the neck and crushed me. </p><p class="indent1"> He has set me up as <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> target;
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">13</span>His archers surround me. </p><p class="indent1"> He pierces my kidneys without mercy </p><p class="indent"> and spills my gall on the ground.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>He breaks me with wound upon wound; </p><p class="indent"> He rushes me like a mighty warrior.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>I have sewn sackcloth over my skin; </p><p class="indent"> I have buried my horn in the dust.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>My face is red with weeping, </p><p class="indent"> and deep shadows ring my eyes;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>yet my hands are free of violence </p><p class="indent"> and my prayer is pure.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>O earth, do not cover my blood; </p><p class="indent"> may my cry for help never be laid to rest.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Even now my witness is in heaven, </p><p class="indent"> and my advocate is on high.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>My friends are my scoffers </p><p class="indent"> as my eyes pour out tears to God.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Oh, that a man might plead with God </p><p class="indent"> as he pleads with his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>For when only a few years are past </p><p class="indent"> I will go the way of no return.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
