The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him and said, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘Put your house in order, for you are about to die; you will not recover.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,
<span class="reftext">3</span>saying, “Please, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, remember how I have walked before <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> faithfully and with wholehearted devotion; I have done what was good in <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Isaiah, saying,
<span class="reftext">5</span>“Go and tell Hezekiah that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of your father David, says: ‘I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">7</span>This will be a sign to you from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> will do what <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> has promised:
<span class="reftext">8</span>I will make the sun’s shadow that falls on the stairway of Ahaz go back ten steps.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1"> So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had descended.
</p><p class="hdg">Hezekiah’s Song of Thanksgiving</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>This is a writing by Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>I said, “In the prime<span class="fn">b</span>  of my life </p><p class="indent"> I must go through the gates of Sheol </p><p class="indent"> and be deprived of the remainder of my years.”
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>I said, “I will never again see <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, </p><p class="indent"> even <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, in the land of the living; </p><p class="indent1"> I will no longer look on mankind </p><p class="indent"> with those who dwell in this world.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>My dwelling has been picked up and removed from me </p><p class="indent"> like a shepherd’s tent. </p><p class="indent1"> I have rolled up my life like a weaver; </p><p class="indent"> He cuts me off from the loom; </p><p class="indent"> from day until night <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> make an end of me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I composed myself<span class="fn">c</span>  until the morning. </p><p class="indent"> Like a lion <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> breaks all my bones; </p><p class="indent"> from day until night <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> make an end of me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I chirp like a swallow or crane; </p><p class="indent"> I moan like a dove. </p><p class="indent1"> My eyes grow weak as I look upward. </p><p class="indent"> O Lord, I am oppressed; be my security.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>What can I say? </p><p class="indent"> He has spoken to me, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span><span class='bsb'>Himself</span> has done this. </p><p class="indent1"> I will walk slowly all my years </p><p class="indent"> because of the anguish of my soul.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>O Lord, by such things men live, </p><p class="indent"> and in all of them my spirit finds life. </p><p class="indent1"> You have restored me to health </p><p class="indent"> and have let me live.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Surely for my own welfare </p><p class="indent"> I had such great anguish; </p><p class="indent1"> but <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> love has delivered me from the pit of oblivion, </p><p class="indent"> for <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> have cast all my sins behind <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span><span class='bsb'>Your</span> back.
