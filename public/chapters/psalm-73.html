<div class="calibre2"><p class="calibre3">BOOK III </p><p class="pshdg">Psalms 73–89 </p><p class="hdg">Surely God Is Good to Israel</p><p class="pshdg"><span class="reftext"></span>A Psalm of Asaph. </p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>Surely God is good to Israel, </p><p class="indent"> to those who are pure in heart.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled; </p><p class="indent"> my steps had nearly slipped.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For I envied the arrogant </p><p class="indent"> when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>They have no struggle in their death; </p><p class="indent"> their bodies are well-fed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>They are free of the burdens others carry; </p><p class="indent"> they are not afflicted like other men.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore pride is their necklace; </p><p class="indent"> a garment of violence covers them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>From their prosperity proceeds iniquity;<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> the imaginations of their hearts run wild.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>They mock and speak with malice; </p><p class="indent"> with arrogance they threaten oppression.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>They set their mouths against the heavens, </p><p class="indent"> and their tongues strut across the earth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>So their people<span class="fn">b</span>  return to this place </p><p class="indent"> and drink up waters in abundance.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The wicked say, “How can God know? </p><p class="indent"> Does the Most High have knowledge?”
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Behold, these are the wicked—</p><p class="indent"> always carefree as they increase their wealth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure; </p><p class="indent"> in innocence I have washed my hands.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>For I am afflicted all day long </p><p class="indent"> and punished every morning.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>If I had said, “I will speak this way,” </p><p class="indent"> then I would have betrayed Your children.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>When I tried to understand all this, </p><p class="indent"> it was troublesome in my sight
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>until I entered God’s sanctuary; </p><p class="indent"> then I discerned their end.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>Surely You set them on slick ground; </p><p class="indent"> You cast them down into ruin.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>How suddenly they are laid waste, </p><p class="indent"> completely swept away by terrors!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Like one waking from a dream, </p><p class="indent"> so You, O Lord, awaken and despise their form.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>When my heart was grieved </p><p class="indent"> and I was pierced within,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>I was senseless and ignorant; </p><p class="indent"> I was a brute beast before You.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>Yet I am always with You; </p><p class="indent"> You hold my right hand.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>You guide me with Your counsel, </p><p class="indent"> and later receive me in glory.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Whom have I in heaven but You? </p><p class="indent"> And on earth I desire no one besides You.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>My flesh and my heart may fail, </p><p class="indent"> but God is the strength<span class="fn">c</span>  of my heart </p><p class="indent"> and my portion forever.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>Those far from You will surely perish; </p><p class="indent"> You destroy all who are unfaithful to You.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>But as for me, it is good to draw near to God. </p><p class="indent"> I have made the Lord GOD my refuge, </p><p class="indent"> that I may proclaim all Your works.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Their eye bulges with fatness</i>; Syriac <i class="calibre6">From their callous heart proceeds iniquity</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">His people</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">rock</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
