<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">More Proverbs of Solomon</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>These are additional proverbs of Solomon, which were copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>It is the glory of God to conceal a matter </p><p class="indent"> and the glory of kings to search it out.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, </p><p class="indent"> so the hearts of kings cannot be searched.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Remove the dross from the silver, </p><p class="indent"> and a vessel for a silversmith will come forth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Remove the wicked from the king’s presence, </p><p class="indent"> and his throne will be established in righteousness.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king, </p><p class="indent"> and do not stand in the place of great men;
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>for it is better that he says to you, “Come up here!” </p><p class="indent"> than that you should be demoted in the presence of the prince. </p><p class="indent1stline"> Even what<span class="fn">a</span>  you have seen with your own eyes,
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">8</span>do not bring hastily to court. </p><p class="indent1"> Otherwise, what will you do in the end </p><p class="indent"> when your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> puts you to shame?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Argue your case with your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> </p><p class="indent"> without betraying another’s confidence,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>lest the one who hears may disgrace you, </p><p class="indent"> and your infamy never go away.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>A word fitly spoken </p><p class="indent"> is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold </p><p class="indent"> is a wise man’s rebuke to a listening ear.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest </p><p class="indent"> is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him; </p><p class="indent"> he refreshes the soul of his masters.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>Like clouds and wind without rain </p><p class="indent"> is the man who boasts of gifts never given.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">15</span>Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, </p><p class="indent"> and a gentle tongue can break a bone.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>If you find honey, eat just what you need, </p><p class="indent"> lest you have too much and vomit it up.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">17</span>Seldom set foot in your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>’s house, </p><p class="indent"> lest he grow weary and hate you.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>Like a club or sword or sharp arrow </p><p class="indent"> is a man who bears false witness against his <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>Like a broken tooth or a foot out of joint </p><p class="indent"> is confidence in a faithless man in time of trouble.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Like one who removes a garment on a cold day </p><p class="indent"> or vinegar poured on a wound<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat, </p><p class="indent"> and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>For in so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head,<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will reward you.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>As the north wind brings forth rain, </p><p class="indent"> so a backbiting tongue brings angry looks.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>Better to live on a corner of the roof </p><p class="indent"> than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">25</span>Like cold water to a weary soul </p><p class="indent"> is good news from a distant land.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>Like a muddied spring or a polluted well </p><p class="indent"> is a righteous man who gives way to the wicked.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>It is not good to eat too much honey </p><p class="indent"> or to search out one’s own glory.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">28</span>Like a city whose walls are broken down </p><p class="indent"> is a man who does not control his temper.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Even the one</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">on soda</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">For you will heap burning coals on his head</i>; cited in Romans 12:20<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
