<font ><b>John’s Inquiry</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Jesus had finished instructing His
twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and preach in their
cities. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Meanwhile John heard in prison about the
works of Christ, and he sent his disciples to ask Him, “Are You the
One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Go
back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive
sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the
dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. Blessed
is the one who does not fall away on account of Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus
began to speak to the crowds about John: <font color="#a80000">“What
did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the
wind? Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine
clothes? Look, those who wear fine clothing are found in kings’
palaces. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you,
and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written:</font>
</font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Behold, I will
send My messenger ahead of You, </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >who will prepare
Your way before You.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Truly I tell you,
among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John
the Baptist. Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater
than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of
heaven has been subject to violence, and the violent lay claim to it.
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. And if you
are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >He who has ears, let
him hear. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >To what can I
compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the
marketplaces and calling out to others: </font></font>

<font color="#a80000">‘<font >We played the
flute for you, </font></font>

dance; </font></font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >For John came
neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’ The
Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at this
glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But
wisdom is vindicated by her actions.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in
which most of His miracles had been performed, because they did not
repent. <font color="#a80000">“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been
performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in
sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it will be more bearable for
Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >And you, Capernaum,
will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to
Hades! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been
performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day. But I tell
you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment
than for you.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Jesus declared, <font color="#a80000">“I
praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden
these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little
children. Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing in Your sight.</font>

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >All things have been
entrusted to Me by My Father. No one knows the Son except the Father,
and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son
chooses to reveal Him. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Come to Me, all you
who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke
upon you and learn from Me; for I am gentle and humble in heart, and
you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden
is light.” </font></font>
