<font >After Jesus had finished instructing His
twelve disciples, He went on from there to teach and preach in their
cities. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Meanwhile John heard in prison about the
works of Christ, and he sent his disciples to ask Him, “Are You the
One who was to come, or should we look for someone else?” </font>

<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Go
back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind receive
sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the
dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. Blessed
is the one who does not fall away on account of Me.”</font> </font>

<font >As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus
began to speak to the crowds about John: <font color="#a80000">“What
did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the
wind? Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine
clothes? Look, those who wear fine clothing are found in kings’
palaces. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you,
and more than a prophet. This is the one about whom it is written:</font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Truly I tell you,
among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John
the Baptist. Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater
than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of
heaven has been subject to violence, and the violent lay claim to it.
For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John. And if you
are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come. </font></font>

repent. <font color="#a80000">“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you,
Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been
performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in
sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it will be more bearable for
Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</font> </font>

you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment
than for you.” </font></font>

<font >At that time Jesus declared, <font color="#a80000">“I
