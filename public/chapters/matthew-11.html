</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Meanwhile John heard in prison about the works of Christ, and he sent his disciples<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">3</span>to ask <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who was to come, or should we look for someone else?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Go back and report to John what you hear and see:

</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Testifies about John<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Malachi 3:1–5; Luke 7:24–35)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: <span>“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?
<span class="reftext">8</span>Otherwise, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who wear fine clothing are found in kings’ palaces.
<span class="reftext">9</span>What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
<span class="reftext">10</span>This is the one about whom it is written:</span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘Behold, I will send <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> messenger ahead of <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>, </p><p class="indentred"> who will prepare <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> way before <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>.’<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">11</span>Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has risen no one greater than John the <span class='cap'>Baptist</span><span class='nocap'>baptist</span>. Yet even the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
<span class="reftext">12</span>From the days of John the <span class='cap'>Baptist</span><span class='nocap'>baptist</span> until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subject to violence,<span class="fn">f</span>  and the violent lay claim to it.
<span class="reftext">13</span>For all the <span class='cap'>Prophets</span><span class='nocap'>prophets</span> and the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> prophesied until John.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">15</span>He who has ears,<span class="fn">h</span>  let him hear.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">16</span>To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others:
</p><p class="indent1stlinered"><span class="reftext">17</span>‘We played the flute for you, </p><p class="indentred"> and you did not dance; </p><p class="indentred1"> we sang a dirge, </p><p class="indentred"> and you did not mourn.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">18</span>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’
<span class="reftext">19</span>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at this glutton and drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by her actions.”
</p><p class="hdg">Woe to the Unrepentant<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Luke 10:13–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> miracles had been performed, because they did not repent.
<span><span class="reftext">21</span>“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> than for you.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">23</span>And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
<span class="reftext">24</span>But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> than for you.”

<span class="reftext">26</span>Yes, <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, for this was well-pleasing in <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> sight.</span>
