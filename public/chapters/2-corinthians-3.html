<font ><b>Ministers of a New Covenant</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Are we beginning to commend ourselves
again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to
you or from you? You yourselves are our letter, inscribed on our
hearts, known and read by everyone. It is clear that you are a letter
from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but
with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on
tablets of human hearts. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Such confidence before God is ours through
Christ. Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim that anything
comes from us, but our competence comes from God. And He has
qualified us as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of
the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if the ministry of death, which was
engraved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the
Israelites could not gaze at the face of Moses because of its
fleeting glory, will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more
glorious? For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, how much
more glorious is the ministry of righteousness! Indeed, what was once
glorious has no glory now in comparison to the glory that surpasses
it. For if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is
the glory of that which endures! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, since we have such a hope, we
are very bold. We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his
face to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of what was fading
away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But their minds were closed. For to this
day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant. It has
not been lifted, because only in Christ can it be removed. And even
to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. But
whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we, who with unveiled
faces all reflect the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into
His image with intensifying glory, which comes from the Lord, who is
the Spirit. </font>
