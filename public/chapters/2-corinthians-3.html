<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Ministers of a New Covenant</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?
<span class="reftext">2</span>You yourselves are our letter, inscribed on our hearts, known and read by everyone.
<span class="reftext">3</span>It is clear that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Such confidence before God is ours through Christ.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim that anything comes from us, but our competence comes from God.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has qualified us as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>; for the letter kills, but the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> gives life.
</p><p class="hdg">The Glory of the New Covenant<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 34:10–35)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now if the ministry of death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at the face of Moses because of its fleeting glory,
<span class="reftext">8</span>will not the ministry of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> be even more glorious?
<span class="reftext">9</span>For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry of righteousness!
<span class="reftext">10</span>Indeed, what was once glorious has no glory now in comparison to the glory that surpasses it.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which endures!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.
<span class="reftext">13</span>We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at the end of what was fading away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But their minds were closed. For to this day the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant. It has not been lifted, because only in Christ can it be removed.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.
<span class="reftext">16</span>But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Now the Lord is the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>, and where the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of the Lord is, there is freedom.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> image with intensifying glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span>.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
