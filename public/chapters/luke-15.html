<font ><b>The Parables of the Lost Sheep, Coin,
and Son</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now all the tax collectors and sinners
were gathering around to listen to Jesus. So the Pharisees and
scribes began to grumble: “This man welcomes sinners and eats with
them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus told them this parable: <font color="#a80000">“What
man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, does
not leave the ninety-nine in the pasture and go after the one that is
lost, until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on
his shoulders, comes home, and calls together his friends and
neighbors to tell them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost
sheep!’ In the same way, I tell you that there will be more joy in
heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous
ones who do not need to repent.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Or what woman who
has ten silver coins and loses one of them does not light a lamp,
sweep her house, and search carefully until she finds it? And when
she finds it, she calls together her friends and neighbors to say,
‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost coin.’ In the same
way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels over
one sinner who repents.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“There
was a man who had two sons. The younger son said to him, ‘Father,
give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between
them.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >After a few days,
the younger son got everything together and journeyed to a distant
country, where he squandered his wealth in wild living. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >After he had spent
all he had, a severe famine swept through that country, and he began
to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that
country, who sent him into his fields to feed the pigs. He longed to
fill his belly with the pods the pigs were eating, but no one would
give him a thing. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Finally he came to
his senses and said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have
plenty of food? But here I am, starving to death! I will get up and
go back to my father and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against
heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
Make me like one of your hired servants.”</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >’
</font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >So he got up and
went to his father. But while he was still in the distance, his
father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son,
embraced him, and kissed him. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The son declared,
‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no
longer worthy to be called your son.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But the father said
to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put
a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf
and kill it. Let us feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was
dead and is alive again! He was lost and is found!’ So they began
to celebrate. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Meanwhile the older
son was in the field, and as he approached the house, he heard music
and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked what was
going on. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Your brother has
returned,’ he said, ‘and your father has killed the fattened
calf, because he has him back safe and sound.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The older son became
angry and refused to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with
him. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But he answered his
father, ‘Look, all these years I have served you and never
disobeyed a commandment of yours. Yet you never gave me even a young
goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours
returns from squandering your wealth with prostitutes, you kill the
fattened calf for him!’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Son, you are
always with me,’ the father said, ‘and all that is mine is yours.
But it was fitting to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of
yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
