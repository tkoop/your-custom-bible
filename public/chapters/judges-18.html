<font ><b>The Danites Take Micah’s Idols</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In those days there was no king in Israel,
and the tribe of the Danites was looking for territory to occupy. For
up to that time they had not come into an inheritance among the
tribes of Israel. So the Danites sent out five men from their clans,
men of valor from Zorah and Eshtaol, to spy out the land and explore
it. “Go and explore the land,” they told them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The men entered the hill country of
Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night.
And while they were near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice
of the young Levite; so they went over and asked him, “Who brought
you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Micah has done this and that for me,”
he replied, “and he has hired me to be his priest.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they said to him, “Please inquire
of God to determine whether we will have a successful journey.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the priest told them, “Go in peace.
The LORD is watching over your journey.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the five men departed and came to
Laish, where they saw that the people were living securely, like the
Sidonians, tranquil and unsuspecting. There was nothing lacking in
the land and no oppressive ruler. And they were far away from the
Sidonians and had no alliance with anyone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the men returned to Zorah and
Eshtaol, their brothers asked them, “What did you find?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They answered, “Come on, let us go up
against them, for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Why
would you fail to act? Do not hesitate to go there and take
possession of the land! When you enter, you will come to an
unsuspecting people and a spacious land, for God has delivered it
into your hand. It is a place where nothing on earth is lacking.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So six hundred Danites departed from Zorah
and Eshtaol, armed with weapons of war. They went up and camped at
Kiriath-jearim in Judah. That is why the place west of Kiriath-jearim
is called Mahaneh-dan to this day. And from there they traveled to
the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the five men who had gone to spy out
the land of Laish said to their brothers, “Did you know that one of
these houses has an ephod, household gods, a graven image, and a
molten idol? Now think about what you should do.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they turned aside there and went to the
home of the young Levite, the house of Micah, and greeted him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The six hundred Danites stood at the
entrance of the gate, armed with their weapons of war. And the five
men who had gone to spy out the land went inside and took the graven
image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten idol, while the
priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred armed
men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they entered Micah’s house and took
the graven image, the ephod, the household idols, and the molten
idol, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Be quiet,” they told him. “Put your
hand over your mouth and come with us and be a father and a priest to
us. Is it better for you to be a priest for the house of one person
or a priest for a tribe and family in Israel?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the priest was glad and took the ephod,
the household idols, and the graven image, and went with the people.
Putting their small children, their livestock, and their possessions
in front of them, they turned and departed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After they were some distance from Micah’s
house, the men in the houses near Micah’s house mobilized and
overtook the Danites. When they called out after them, the Danites
turned to face them and said to Micah, “What is the matter with you
that you have called out such a company?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He replied, “You took the gods I had
made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you
say to me, ‘What is the matter with you?’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Danites said to him, “Do not raise
your voice against us, or angry men will attack you, and you and your
family will lose your lives.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the Danites went on their way, and
Micah turned to go back home, because he saw that they were too
strong for him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After they had taken Micah’s idols and
his priest, they went to Laish, to a tranquil and unsuspecting
people, and they struck them with their swords and burned down the
city. There was no one to deliver them, because the city was far from
Sidon and had no alliance with anyone; it was in a valley near
Beth-rehob. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the Danites rebuilt the city and lived
there. They named it Dan, after their forefather Dan, who was born to
Israel—though the city was formerly named Laish. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Danites set up idols for themselves,
and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were
priests for the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the
land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they set up for themselves Micah’s
graven image, and it was there the whole time the house of God was in
Shiloh. </font>
