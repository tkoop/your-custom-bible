<font >Then the LORD called to Moses and spoke to
him from the Tent of Meeting, saying, “Speak to the Israelites and
tell them: When any of you brings an offering to the LORD, you may
bring as your offering an animal from the herd or the flock. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If one’s offering is a burnt offering
from the herd, he is to present an unblemished male. He must bring it
to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for its acceptance before the
LORD. He is to lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, so it
can be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And he shall slaughter the young bull
before the LORD, and Aaron’s sons the priests are to present the
blood and sprinkle it on all sides of the altar at the entrance to
the Tent of Meeting. Next, he is to skin the burnt offering and cut
it into pieces. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The sons of Aaron the priest shall put a
fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. Then Aaron’s sons
the priests are to arrange the pieces, including the head and the
fat, atop the burning wood on the altar. The entrails and legs must
be washed with water, and the priest shall burn all of it on the
altar as a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma
to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If, however, one’s offering is a burnt
offering from the flock—from the sheep or goats—he is to present
an unblemished male. He shall slaughter it on the north side of the
altar before the LORD, and Aaron’s sons the priests are to sprinkle
its blood against the altar on all sides. He is to cut the animal
into pieces, and the priest shall arrange them, including the head
and fat, atop the burning wood that is on the altar. The entrails and
legs must be washed with water, and the priest shall bring all of it
and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering made by
fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If, instead, one’s offering to the LORD
is a burnt offering of birds, he is to present a turtledove or a
young pigeon. Then the priest shall bring it to the altar, twist off
its head, and burn it on the altar; its blood should be drained out
on the side of the altar. And he is to remove the crop with its
contents and throw it to the east side of the altar, in the place for
ashes. He shall tear it open by its wings, without dividing the bird
completely. And the priest is to burn it on the altar atop the
burning wood. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, a
pleasing aroma to the LORD. </font>
