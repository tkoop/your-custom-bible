<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Elkanah and His Wives<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 113:1–9)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now there was a man named Elkanah who was from Ramathaim-zophim<span class="fn">a</span>  in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu,<span class="fn">b</span>  the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
<span class="reftext">2</span>He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Year after year Elkanah would go up from his city to worship and sacrifice to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts at Shiloh, where Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And whenever the day came for Elkanah to present his sacrifice, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.
<span class="reftext">5</span>But to Hannah he would give a double portion,<span class="fn">c</span>  for he loved her even though <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had closed her womb.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival would provoke her and taunt her viciously.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And this went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, her rival taunted her until she wept and would not eat.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>“Hannah, why are you crying?” her husband Elkanah asked. “Why won’t you eat? Why is your heart so grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”
</p><p class="hdg">Hannah Prays for a Son</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the temple of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>In her bitter distress, Hannah prayed to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and wept with many tears.
<span class="reftext">11</span>And she made a vow, pleading, “O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span> of Hosts, if only You will look upon the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, not forgetting Your maidservant but giving her a son, then I will dedicate him to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> all the days of his life, and no razor shall ever come over his head.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>As Hannah kept on praying before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, Eli watched her mouth.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Hannah was praying in her heart, and though her lips were moving, her voice could not be heard. </p><p class="reg1"> So Eli thought she was drunk
<span class="reftext">14</span>and said to her, “How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>“No, my lord,” Hannah replied. “I am a woman oppressed in spirit. I have not had any wine or strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; for all this time I have been praying out of the depth of my anguish and grief.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>“Go in peace,” Eli replied, “and may the God of Israel grant the petition you have asked of Him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>“May your maidservant find <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> with you,” said Hannah. Then she went on her way, and she began eating again, and her face was no longer downcast.
</p><p class="hdg">The Birth of Samuel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>The next morning Elkanah and Hannah got up early to bow in worship before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and then returned home to Ramah. </p><p class="reg1"> And Elkanah had relations with his wife Hannah, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> remembered her.
<span class="reftext">20</span>So in the course of time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel,<span class="fn">d</span>  saying, “Because I have asked for him from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then Elkanah and all his house went up to make the annual sacrifice to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and to <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> his vow,
<span class="reftext">22</span>but Hannah did not go. “After the boy is weaned,” she said to her husband, “I will take him to appear before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and to stay there permanently.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>“Do what you think is best,” her husband Elkanah replied, “and stay here until you have weaned him. Only may <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> confirm His word.”<span class="fn">f</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> So Hannah stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Once she had weaned him, Hannah took the boy with her, along with a three-year-old bull,<span class="fn">g</span>  an ephah of flour,<span class="fn">h</span>  and a skin of wine. Though the boy was still young, she brought him to the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> at Shiloh.
<span class="reftext">25</span>And when they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>“Please, my lord,” said Hannah, “as surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">27</span>I prayed for this boy, and since <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has granted me what I asked of Him,
<span class="reftext">28</span>I now dedicate the boy to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. For as long as he lives, he is dedicated to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.” </p><p class="reg1"> So they worshiped<span class="fn">i</span>  <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> there.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">from Ramathaim, a Zuphite</i>; see LXX and 1 Chronicles 6:26 and 35.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Elihu</i> is also called <i class="calibre6">Eliab</i> and <i class="calibre6">Eliel</i>; see 1 Chronicles 6:27 and 34.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a choice portion</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Samuel</i> sounds like the Hebrew for <i class="calibre6">heard of God</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> MT; DSS include <i class="calibre6">I will offer him as a Nazirite for all time.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> MT; DSS, LXX, and Syriac <i class="calibre6">your word</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> DSS, LXX, and Syriac; MT <i class="calibre6">three bulls</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">An ephah</i> is approximately 20 dry quarts or 22 liters (probably about 25.5 pounds or 11.6 kilograms of flour).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> One DSS manuscript; MT <i class="calibre6">he worshiped</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
