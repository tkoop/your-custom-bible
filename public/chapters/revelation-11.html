<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I was given a measuring rod like a
staff and was told, “Go and measure the temple of God and the
altar, and count the number of worshipers there. But exclude the
courtyard outside the temple. Do not measure it, because it has been
given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for 42
months. And I will empower my two witnesses, and they will prophesy
for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">These witnesses are the two olive trees
and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. If
anyone wants to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouths and
devours their enemies. In this way, anyone who wants to harm them
must be killed. These witnesses have power to shut the sky so that no
rain will fall during the days of their prophecy, and power to turn
the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of
plague as often as they wish. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the two witnesses have finished their
testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will wage war with
them, and will overpower and kill them. Their bodies will lie in the
street of the great city—figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—where
their Lord was also crucified. For three and a half days all peoples
and tribes and tongues and nations will view their bodies and will
not permit them to be laid in a tomb. And those who dwell on the
earth will gloat over them, and will celebrate and send one another
gifts, because these two prophets had tormented them. </font>

breath of life from God entered the two witnesses, and they stood on
their feet, and great fear fell upon those who saw them. And the
witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Come up here.”
And they went up to heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched them. </font>
