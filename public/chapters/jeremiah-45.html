<font ><b>Jeremiah’s Message to Baruch</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet
spoke to Baruch son of Neriah when he wrote these words on a scroll
at the dictation of Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of
Josiah, king of Judah: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >This is what the LORD, the God of
Israel, says to you, Baruch: You have said, ‘Woe is me because the
LORD has added sorrow to my pain! I am worn out with groaning and
have found no rest.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus Jeremiah was to say to Baruch: “This
is what the LORD says: Throughout the land I will demolish what I
have built and uproot what I have planted. But as for you, do you
seek great things for yourself? Stop seeking! For I will bring
disaster on every living creature, declares the LORD, but wherever
you go, I will grant your life as a spoil of war.” </font>
