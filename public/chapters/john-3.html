<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jesus and Nicodemus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Genesis 22:1–10; Romans 5:6–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews.
<span class="reftext">2</span>He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.<span class="fn">a</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“How can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time to be born?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Jesus answered, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Flesh is born of flesh, but spirit is born of the Spirit.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Do not be amazed that I said, ‘You<span class="fn">b</span>  must be born again.’
<span class="reftext">8</span>The wind blows where it wishes. You hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“How can this be?” Nicodemus asked.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">10</span>“You are Israel’s teacher,”</span> said Jesus, <span>“and you do not understand these things?
<span class="reftext">11</span>Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, and yet you people do not accept our testimony.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">12</span>If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?
<span class="reftext">13</span>No one has ascended into heaven except the One who descended from heaven—the Son of Man.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
<span class="reftext">15</span>that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">16</span>For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only<span class="fn">e</span>  Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">19</span>And this is the verdict: The Light has come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the Light because their deeds were evil.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come into the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.
<span class="reftext">21</span>But whoever practices the truth comes into the Light, so that it may be seen clearly that what he has done has been accomplished in God.”<span class="fn">f</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">John’s Testimony about Jesus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>After this, Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, where He spent some time with them and baptized.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because the water was plentiful there, and people kept coming to be baptized.
<span class="reftext">24</span>(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then a dispute arose between John’s disciples and a certain Jew<span class="fn">g</span>  over the issue of ceremonial washing.
<span class="reftext">26</span>So John’s disciples came to him and said, “Look, Rabbi, the One who was with you beyond the Jordan, the One you testified about—He is baptizing, and everyone is going to Him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>John replied, “A man can receive only what is given him from heaven.
<span class="reftext">28</span>You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but am sent ahead of Him.’
<span class="reftext">29</span>The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom stands and listens for him, and is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.
<span class="reftext">30</span>He must increase; I must decrease.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>The One who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth. The One who comes from heaven is above all.<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">32</span>He testifies to what He has seen and heard, yet no one accepts His testimony.
<span class="reftext">33</span>Whoever accepts His testimony has certified that God is truthful.
<span class="reftext">34</span>For the One whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>The Father loves the Son and has placed all things in His hands.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. Whoever rejects the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him.”<span class="fn">i</span> </p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">born from above</i>; also in verse 7.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> The Greek word for <i class="calibre6">you</i> is plural; also in verse 12.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">who is in heaven</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">everyone who believes may have eternal life in Him.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">only begotten</i> or <i class="calibre6">unique</i>; also in verse 18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Some translators close this quotation after verse 15.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> TR <i class="calibre6">and the Jews</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Tischendorf  <i class="calibre6">The One comes from heaven.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Some translators close this quotation after verse 30.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
