<span class="reftext">2</span>He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> are doing if God were not with him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.<span class="fn">a</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“How can a man be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time to be born?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Jesus answered, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Flesh is born of flesh, but spirit is born of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Do not be amazed that I said, ‘<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span><span class="fn">b</span>  must be born again.’
<span class="reftext">8</span>The wind blows where it wishes. You hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“How can this be?” Nicodemus asked.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">10</span>“You are Israel’s teacher,”</span> said Jesus, <span>“and you do not understand these things?
<span class="reftext">11</span>Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, and yet <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> people do not accept our testimony.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">12</span>If I have told <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> about earthly things and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not believe, how will <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> believe if I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> about heavenly things?
<span class="reftext">13</span>No one has ascended into <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> except the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> who descended from <span class='cap'>Heaven</span><span class='nocap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span>—the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of Man.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of Man must be lifted up,
<span class="reftext">15</span>that everyone who believes in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> may have eternal life.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">16</span>For God so loved the world that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> gave <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> one and only<span class="fn">e</span>  <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span>, that everyone who believes in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> shall not perish but have eternal life.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For God did not send <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Whoever believes in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span>.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">19</span>And this is the verdict: The <span class='cap'>Light</span><span class='nocap'>light</span><span class='bsb'>Light</span> has come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the <span class='cap'>Light</span><span class='nocap'>light</span><span class='bsb'>Light</span> because their deeds were evil.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Everyone who does evil hates the <span class='cap'>Light</span><span class='nocap'>light</span><span class='bsb'>Light</span>, and does not come into the <span class='cap'>Light</span><span class='nocap'>light</span><span class='bsb'>Light</span> for fear that his deeds will be exposed.
<span class="reftext">21</span>But whoever practices the truth comes into the <span class='cap'>Light</span><span class='nocap'>light</span><span class='bsb'>Light</span>, so that it may be seen clearly that what he has done has been accomplished in God.”<span class="fn">f</span>

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because the water was plentiful there, and people kept coming to be baptized.
<span class="reftext">24</span>(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then a dispute arose between John’s disciples and a certain Jew<span class="fn">g</span>  over the issue of ceremonial washing.
<span class="reftext">26</span>So John’s disciples came to him and said, “Look, <span class='cap'>Rabbi</span><span class='nocap'>rabbi</span><span class='bsb'>Rabbi</span>, the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> who was with you beyond the Jordan, the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span><span class='bsb'>One</span> you testified about—<span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> is baptizing, and everyone is going to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.”
