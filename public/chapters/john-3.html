<font ><b>Jesus and Nicodemus</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now there was a man of the Pharisees named
Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews. He came to Jesus at night and said,
“Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher who has come from God. For
no one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with
him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Truly,
truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is
born again.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >How can a man be born when he is old?”
Nicodemus asked. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time to
be born?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“Truly,
truly, I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is
born of water and the Spirit. Flesh is born of flesh, but spirit is
born of the Spirit. Do not be amazed that I said, ‘You must be born
again.’ The wind blows where it wishes. You hear its sound, but you
do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with
everyone born of the Spirit.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >How can this be?” Nicodemus asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >You are Israel’s
teacher,”</font> said Jesus, <font color="#a80000">“and you do
not understand these things? Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak of
what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, and yet you people
do not accept our testimony.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >If I have told you
about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if
I tell you about heavenly things? No one has ascended into heaven
except the One who descended from heaven—the Son of Man. Just as
Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must
be lifted up, that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal
life. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >For God so loved the
world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes
in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send
His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world
through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever
does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not
believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >And this is the
verdict: The Light has come into the world, but men loved the
darkness rather than the Light because their deeds were evil.
Everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come into the
Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But whoever practices
the truth comes into the Light, so that it may be seen clearly that
what he has done has been accomplished in God.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After this, Jesus and His disciples went
into the Judean countryside, where He spent some time with them and
baptized. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near
Salim, because the water was plentiful there, and people kept coming
to be baptized. (For John had not yet been thrown into prison.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a dispute arose between John’s
disciples and a certain Jew over the issue of ceremonial washing. So
John’s disciples came to him and said, “Look, Rabbi, the One who
was with you beyond the Jordan, the One you testified about—He is
baptizing, and everyone is going to Him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >John replied, “A man can receive only
what is given him from heaven. You yourselves can testify that I
said, ‘I am not the Christ, but am sent ahead of Him.’ The bride
belongs to the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom stands and
listens for him, and is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom’s voice.
That joy is mine, and it is now complete. He must increase; I must
decrease. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The One who comes from above is above all.
The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one
from the earth. The One who comes from heaven is above all. He
testifies to what He has seen and heard, yet no one accepts His
testimony. Whoever accepts His testimony has certified that God is
truthful. For the One whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for
God gives the Spirit without limit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Father loves the Son and has placed
all things in His hands. Whoever believes in the Son has eternal
life. Whoever rejects the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath
of God remains on him.” </font>
