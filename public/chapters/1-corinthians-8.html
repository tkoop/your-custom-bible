Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
<span class="reftext">2</span>The one who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But the one who loves God is known by God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world, and that there is no God but one.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many so-called gods and lords),
<span class="reftext">6</span>yet for us there is but one God, the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, from whom all things came and for whom we exist. And there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we exist.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>But not everyone has this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that they eat such food as if it were sacrificed to an idol. And since their conscience is weak, it is defiled.
<span class="reftext">8</span>But food does not bring us closer to God: We are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Be careful, however, that <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For if someone with a weak conscience sees you who are well informed eating in an idol’s temple, will he not be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols?
<span class="reftext">11</span>So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge.
<span class="reftext">12</span>By sinning against <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers in this way and wounding their weak conscience, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> sin against Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to stumble.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
