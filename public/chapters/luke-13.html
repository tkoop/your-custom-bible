Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their
sacrifices. To this He replied, <font color="#a80000">“Do you think
that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans,
because they suffered this fate? No, I tell you. But unless you
repent, you too will all perish. Or those eighteen who were killed
when the tower of Siloam collapsed on them: Do you think that they
were more sinful than all the others living in Jerusalem? No, I tell
you. But unless you repent, you too will all perish.”</font> </font>

man had a fig tree that was planted in his vineyard. He went to look
for fruit on it, but did not find any. So he said to the keeper of
the vineyard, ‘Look, for the past three years I have come to search
for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Therefore cut it
down! Why should it use up the soil?’</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000">‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">Sir,’ the man
replied, ‘leave it alone again this year, until I dig around it and

cut it down.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font face="Tahoma, serif"> </font></font><font face="Tahoma, serif">”

<font face="Tahoma, serif">One Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of
the synagogues, and a woman there had been disabled by a spirit for
eighteen years. She was hunched over and could not stand up straight.
When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said, <font color="#a80000">“Woman,
you are set free from your disability.”</font> Then He placed His
hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and began to
glorify God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the synagogue leader was indignant
that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. “There are six days for
work,” he told the crowd. “So come and be healed on those days
and not on the Sabbath.” </font>

<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You hypocrites!”</font>
the Lord replied. <font color="#a80000">“Does not each of you on
the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it to
water? Then should not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept
bound for eighteen long years, be released from her bondage on the
Sabbath day?”</font> </font>

were humiliated. And the whole crowd rejoiced at all the glorious
things He was doing. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus asked, <font color="#a80000">“What
is the kingdom of God like? To what can I compare it? It is like a
mustard seed that a man tossed into his garden. It grew and became a
tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.”</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Again He asked, <font color="#a80000">“To
