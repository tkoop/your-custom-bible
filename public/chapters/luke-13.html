<font >At that time some of those present told
Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their
sacrifices. To this He replied, <font color="#a80000">“Do you think
that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans,
because they suffered this fate? No, I tell you. But unless you
repent, you too will all perish. Or those eighteen who were killed
when the tower of Siloam collapsed on them: Do you think that they
were more sinful than all the others living in Jerusalem? No, I tell
you. But unless you repent, you too will all perish.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus told this parable: <font color="#a80000">“A
man had a fig tree that was planted in his vineyard. He went to look
for fruit on it, but did not find any. So he said to the keeper of
the vineyard, ‘Look, for the past three years I have come to search
for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Therefore cut it
down! Why should it use up the soil?’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >Sir,’ the man
replied, ‘leave it alone again this year, until I dig around it and
fertilize it. If it bears fruit next year, fine. But if not, you can
cut it down.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
</font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of
the synagogues, and a woman there had been disabled by a spirit for
eighteen years. She was hunched over and could not stand up straight.
When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said, <font color="#a80000">“Woman,
you are set free from your disability.”</font> Then He placed His
hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and began to
glorify God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the synagogue leader was indignant
that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. “There are six days for
work,” he told the crowd. “So come and be healed on those days
and not on the Sabbath.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >You hypocrites!”</font>
the Lord replied. <font color="#a80000">“Does not each of you on
the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it to
water? Then should not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept
bound for eighteen long years, be released from her bondage on the
Sabbath day?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus said this, all His adversaries
were humiliated. And the whole crowd rejoiced at all the glorious
things He was doing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus asked, <font color="#a80000">“What
is the kingdom of God like? To what can I compare it? It is like a
mustard seed that a man tossed into his garden. It grew and became a
tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again He asked, <font color="#a80000">“To
what can I compare the kingdom of God? It is like leaven that a woman
took and mixed into three measures of flour, until all of it was
leavened.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus traveled throughout the towns
and villages, teaching as He made His way toward Jerusalem. “Lord,”
someone asked Him, “will only a few people be saved?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“Make
every effort to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you,
will try to enter and will not be able. After the master of the house
gets up and shuts the door, you will stand outside knocking and
saying, ‘Lord, open the door for us.’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But he will reply,
‘I do not know where you are from.’ </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Then you will say,
‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >And he will answer,
‘I tell you, I do not know where you are from. Depart from me, all
you evildoers.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >There will be
weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves are thrown
out. People will come from east and west and north and south, and
will recline at the table in the kingdom of God. And indeed, some who
are last will be first, and some who are first will be last.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that very hour, some Pharisees came to
Jesus and told Him, “Leave this place and get away, because Herod
wants to kill You.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Go
tell that fox, ‘Look, I will keep driving out demons and healing
people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach My
goal.’ Nevertheless, I must keep going today and tomorrow and the
next day, for it is not admissible for a prophet to perish outside of
Jerusalem.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those sent to her, how
often I have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers
her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling! Look, your house
is left to you desolate. And I tell you that you will not see Me
again until you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the
Lord.’” </font></font>
