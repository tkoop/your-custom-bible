<font ><b>Laws about Skin Diseases</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
“When someone has a swelling or rash or bright spot on his skin
that could become an infectious skin disease, he must be brought to
Aaron the priest or to one of his sons who is a priest. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The priest is to examine the infection on
his skin, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the
sore appears to be deeper than the skin, it is a skin disease. After
the priest examines him, he must pronounce him unclean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If, however, the spot on his skin is white
and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair in it
has not turned white, the priest shall isolate the infected person
for seven days. On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine him,
and if he sees that the infection is unchanged and has not spread on
the skin, the priest must isolate him for another seven days. The
priest will examine him again on the seventh day, and if the sore has
faded and has not spread on the skin, the priest shall pronounce him
clean; it is a rash. The person must wash his clothes and be clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if the rash spreads further on his
skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he
must present himself again to the priest. The priest will reexamine
him, and if the rash has spread on the skin, the priest must
pronounce him unclean; he has a skin disease. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When anyone develops a skin disease, he
must be brought to the priest. The priest will examine him, and if
there is a white swelling on the skin that has turned the hair white,
and there is raw flesh in the swelling, it is a chronic skin disease
and the priest must pronounce him unclean. He need not isolate him,
for he is unclean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if the skin disease breaks out all
over his skin so that it covers all the skin of the infected person
from head to foot, as far as the priest can see, the priest shall
examine him, and if the disease has covered his entire body, he is to
pronounce the infected person clean. Since it has all turned white,
he is clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But whenever raw flesh appears on someone,
he will be unclean. When the priest sees the raw flesh, he must
pronounce him unclean. The raw flesh is unclean; it is a skin
disease. But if the raw flesh changes and turns white, he must go to
the priest. The priest will reexamine him, and if the infection has
turned white, the priest is to pronounce the infected person clean;
then he is clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When a boil appears on someone’s skin
and it heals, and a white swelling or a reddish-white spot develops
where the boil was, he must present himself to the priest. The priest
shall examine it, and if it appears to be beneath the skin and the
hair in it has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean;
it is a diseased infection that has broken out in the boil. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when the priest examines it, if there
is no white hair in it, and it is not beneath the skin and has faded,
the priest shall isolate him for seven days. If it spreads any
further on the skin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is an
infection. But if the spot remains unchanged and does not spread, it
is only the scar from the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him
clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When there is a burn on someone’s skin
and the raw area of the burn becomes reddish-white or white, the
priest must examine it. If the hair in the spot has turned white and
the spot appears to be deeper than the skin, it is a disease that has
broken out in the burn. The priest must pronounce him unclean; it is
a diseased infection. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if the priest examines it and there is
no white hair in the spot, and it is not beneath the skin but has
faded, the priest shall isolate him for seven days. On the seventh
day the priest is to reexamine him, and if it has spread further on
the skin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a diseased
infection. But if the spot is unchanged and has not spread on the
skin but has faded, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest is
to pronounce him clean; for it is only the scar from the burn. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If a man or woman has an infection on the
head or chin, the priest shall examine the infection, and if it
appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair in it is yellow and
thin, the priest must pronounce him unclean; it is a scaly outbreak,
an infectious disease of the head or chin. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if the priest examines the scaly
infection and it does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and
there is no black hair in it, the priest shall isolate the infected
person for seven days. On the seventh day the priest is to reexamine
the infection, and if the scaly outbreak has not spread and there is
no yellow hair in it, and it does not appear to be deeper than the
skin, then the person must shave himself except for the scaly area.
Then the priest shall isolate him for another seven days. On the
seventh day the priest shall examine the scaly outbreak, and if it
has not spread on the skin and does not appear to be deeper than the
skin, the priest is to pronounce him clean. He must wash his clothes,
and he will be clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If, however, the scaly outbreak spreads
further on the skin after his cleansing, the priest is to examine
him, and if the scaly outbreak has spread on the skin, the priest
need not look for yellow hair; the person is unclean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If, however, in his sight the scaly
outbreak is unchanged and black hair has grown in it, then it has
healed. He is clean, and the priest is to pronounce him clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When a man or a woman has white spots on
the skin, the priest shall examine them, and if the spots are dull
white, it is a harmless rash that has broken out on the skin; the
person is clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if a man loses his hair and is bald,
he is still clean. Or if his hairline recedes and he is bald on his
forehead, he is still clean. But if there is a reddish-white sore on
the bald head or forehead, it is an infectious disease breaking out
on it. The priest is to examine him, and if the swelling of the
infection on his bald head or forehead is reddish-white like a skin
disease, the man is diseased; he is unclean. The priest must
pronounce him unclean because of the infection on his head. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A diseased person must wear torn clothes
and let his hair hang loose, and he must cover his mouth and cry out,
‘Unclean, unclean!’ As long as he has the infection, he remains
unclean. He must live alone in a place outside the camp. </font>

<font >If any fabric is contaminated with
mildew—any wool or linen garment, any weave or knit of linen or
wool, or any article of leather— and if the mark in the fabric,
leather, weave, knit, or leather article is green or red, then it is
contaminated with mildew and must be shown to the priest. And the
priest is to examine the mildew and isolate the contaminated fabric
for seven days. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the seventh day the priest shall
reexamine it, and if the mildew has spread in the fabric, weave,
knit, or leather, then regardless of how it is used, it is a harmful
mildew; the article is unclean. He is to burn the fabric, weave, or
knit, whether the contaminated item is wool or linen or leather.
Since the mildew is harmful, the article must be burned up. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when the priest reexamines it, if the
mildew has not spread in the fabric, weave, knit, or leather article,
the priest is to order the contaminated article to be washed and
isolated for another seven days. After it has been washed, the priest
is to reexamine it, and if the mildewed article has not changed in
appearance, it is unclean. Even though the mildew has not spread, you
must burn it, whether the rot is on the front or back. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If the priest examines it and the mildew
has faded after it has been washed, he must cut the contaminated
section out of the fabric, leather, weave, or knit. But if it
reappears in the fabric, weave, or knit, or on any leather article,
it is spreading. You must burn the contaminated article. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If the mildew disappears from the fabric,
weave, or knit, or any leather article after washing, then it is to
be washed again, and it will be clean. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the law concerning a mildew
contamination in wool or linen fabric, weave, or knit, or any leather
article, for pronouncing it clean or unclean.” </font>
