</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">27</span>Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but his brothers did not have many children, so their whole clan did not become as numerous as the sons of Judah.
<span class="reftext">28</span>They lived in Beersheba, Moladah, Hazar-shual,

<span class="reftext">39</span>and they journeyed to the entrance of Gedor, to the east side of the valley, in search of pasture for their flocks.
<span class="reftext">40</span>There they found rich, good pasture, and the land was spacious, peaceful, and quiet; for some Hamites had lived there formerly.
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">41</span>These who were noted by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. They attacked the Hamites and Meunites there in their dwellings, devoting them to destruction<span class="fn">n</span>  even to this day. Then they settled in their place, because there was pasture for their flocks.
<span class="reftext">42</span>And five hundred of these Simeonites led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, went to Mount Seir
<span class="reftext">43</span>and struck down the remnant of the Amalekites who had escaped. And they have lived there to this day.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> LXX (see also Vulgate); Hebrew <i class="calibre6">These were of the father</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the founder</i>; also in verses 5, 12, 14, 17, 18, and possibly elsewhere<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Alternate MT reading; the other alternate (see also Vulgate) reads <i class="calibre6">Izhar</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Jabez</i> sounds like the Hebrew for <i class="calibre6">pain</i> or <i class="calibre6">distress</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Vulgate and some LXX; Hebrew does not include <i class="calibre6">and Meonothai</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Ge-harashim, for they were craftsmen</i>.
