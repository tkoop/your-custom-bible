<font ><b>Jehu Kills the Princes of Judah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah,
the youngest son of Jehoram, king in his place, since the raiders who
had come into the camp with the Arabs had killed all the older sons.
So Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah. Ahaziah was
twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem
one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of
Omri. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ahaziah also walked in the ways of the
house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor in wickedness. And he
did evil in the sight of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for
to his destruction they were his counselors after the death of his
father. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ahaziah also followed their counsel and
went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to fight against Hazael
king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram; so he
returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on
him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah
son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to visit Joram son
of Ahab, because Joram had been wounded. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Ahaziah’s downfall came from God when he
went to visit Joram. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to
meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the
house of Ahab. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So while Jehu was executing judgment on
the house of Ahab, he found the rulers of Judah and the sons of
Ahaziah’s brothers who were serving Ahaziah, and he killed them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehu looked for Ahaziah, and Jehu’s
soldiers captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. So Ahaziah was
brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “He
is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his
heart.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So no one was left from the house of
Ahaziah with the strength to rule the kingdom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw
that her son was dead, she proceeded to annihilate all the royal
heirs of the house of Judah. But Jehoshabeath daughter of King
Jehoram took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the
sons of the king who were being murdered, and she put him and his
nurse in a bedroom. Because Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King
Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest, was Ahaziah’s sister,
she hid Joash from Athaliah so that she could not kill him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Joash remained hidden with them in the
house of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land. </font>
