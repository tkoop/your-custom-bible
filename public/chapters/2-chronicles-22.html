So Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Ahaziah was twenty-two<span class="fn">b</span>  years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Ahaziah also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his <span class='spell ca'>counsellor</span><span class='spell gb'>counsellor</span><span class='spell us'>counselor</span> in wickedness.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And he did evil in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, as the house of Ahab had done, for to his destruction they were his counselors after the death of his father.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Ahaziah also followed their counsel and went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to fight against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans<span class="fn">c</span>  wounded Joram;<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">6</span>so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramah<span class="fn">e</span>  when he fought against Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah<span class="fn">f</span>  son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to visit Joram son of Ahab, because Joram had been wounded.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Ahaziah’s downfall came from God when he went to visit Joram. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son<span class="fn">g</span>  of Nimshi, whom <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
</p><p class="hdg">Jehu Kills the Princes of Judah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 9:14–29)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So while Jehu was executing <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> on the house of Ahab, he found the rulers of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s brothers who were serving Ahaziah, and he killed them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Jehu looked for Ahaziah, and Jehu’s soldiers captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. So Ahaziah was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, “He is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> with all his heart.” </p><p class="reg1"> So no one was left from the house of Ahaziah with the strength to rule the kingdom.
</p><p class="hdg">Athaliah and Joash<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 11:1–3)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to annihilate all the royal heirs of the house of Judah.
<span class="reftext">11</span>But Jehoshabeath<span class="fn">h</span>  daughter of King Jehoram took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the sons of the king who were being murdered, and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Because Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest, was Ahaziah’s sister, she hid Joash from Athaliah so that she could not kill him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And Joash remained hidden with them in the house of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">since the marauding bands of Arabs</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Some LXX manuscripts and Syriac (see also 2 Kings 8:26); Hebrew <i class="calibre6">forty-two</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Some LXX manuscripts <i class="calibre6">the archers</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Jehoram</i>, a variant of <i class="calibre6">Joram</i>; also in verses 6 and 7<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Ramah</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Ramoth</i>; see verse 5.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Some Hebrew manuscripts, LXX, Vulgate, and Syriac (see also 2 Kings 8:29); most Hebrew manuscripts <i class="calibre6">Azariah</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Or <i class="calibre6">grandson</i>; see 2 Kings 9:14.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">Jehoshabeath</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Jehosheba</i>; twice in this verse; see 2 Kings 11:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
