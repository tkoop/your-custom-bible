</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Dan and Naphtali; </p><p class="list1stline"> Gad and Asher.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy<span class="fn">a</span>  in all, including Joseph, who was already in Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,
<span class="reftext">7</span>but the Israelites were fruitful and increased rapidly; they multiplied and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.
</p><p class="hdg">Oppression by a New King<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Acts 7:15–19)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then a new king, who did not know Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
<span class="reftext">9</span>“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become too numerous and too powerful for us.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase even more; and if a war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.<span class="fn">b</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So the Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>. As a result, they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and flourished; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>They worked the Israelites ruthlessly
<span class="reftext">14</span>and made their lives bitter with hard <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> in brick and mortar, and with all kinds of work in the fields. Every service they imposed was harsh.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,
<span class="reftext">16</span>“When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them on the birthstools. If the child is a son, kill him; but if it is a daughter, let her live.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had instructed; they let the boys live.
<span class="reftext">18</span>So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>The midwives answered Pharaoh, “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before a midwife arrives.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied and became even more numerous.
<span class="reftext">21</span>And because the midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: “Every son born to the Hebrews<span class="fn">c</span>  you must throw into the Nile, but every daughter you may allow to live.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> MT (see also Genesis 46:27); DSS and LXX (see also Acts 7:14) <i class="calibre6">seventy-five</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">and take the country</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> SP, LXX, and Targum Yonaton; Hebrew does not include <i class="calibre6">to the Hebrews</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
