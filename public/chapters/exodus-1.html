<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy
in all, including Joseph, who was already in Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now Joseph and all his brothers and all
that generation died, but the Israelites were fruitful and increased
rapidly; they multiplied and became exceedingly numerous, so that the
land was filled with them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then a new king, who did not know Joseph,
came to power in Egypt. “Look,” he said to his people, “the
Israelites have become too numerous and too powerful for us. Come,
let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase even more; and
if a war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and
leave the country.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So the Egyptians appointed taskmasters
over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor. As a result,
they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. But the
more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and flourished; so
the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >They worked the Israelites ruthlessly and
made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar, and with
all kinds of work in the fields. Every service they imposed was
harsh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew
midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, “When you help the
Hebrew women give birth, observe them on the birthstools. If the
child is a son, kill him; but if it is a daughter, let her live.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The midwives, however, feared God and did
not do as the king of Egypt had instructed; they let the boys live.
So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why
have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >The midwives answered Pharaoh, “The
Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous
and give birth before a midwife arrives.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >So God was good to the midwives, and the
people multiplied and became even more numerous. And because the
midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Pharaoh commanded all his people:
“Every son born to the Hebrews you must throw into the Nile, but
every daughter you may allow to live.” </font>
