<font ><b>Solomon Anointed to Build the Temple</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David said, “Here shall be the
house of the LORD God, as well as the altar of burnt offering for
Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David gave orders to gather the
foreigners in the land of Israel, from whom he appointed stonecutters
to prepare finished stones for building the house of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >David provided a large quantity of iron to
make the nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings,
together with more bronze than could be weighed and more cedar logs
than could be counted; for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a
large quantity of cedar logs to David. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David said, “My son Solomon is young
and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD must be
exceedingly magnificent—famous and glorious throughout all lands.
Therefore I must make preparations for it.” So David made lavish
preparations before his death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David called for his son Solomon and
instructed him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >My son,” said David to Solomon, “it
was in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God, but
this word of the LORD came to me: ‘You have shed much blood and
waged great wars. You are not to build a house for My Name because
you have shed so much blood on the ground before Me. But a son will
be born to you who will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from
all his enemies on every side; for his name will be Solomon, and I
will grant to Israel peace and quiet during his reign. He is the one
who will build a house for My Name. He will be My son, and I will be
his Father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over
Israel forever.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now, my son, may the LORD be with you, and
may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as He
said you would. Above all, may the LORD give you insight and
understanding when He puts you in command over Israel, so that you
may keep the Law of the LORD your God. Then you will succeed, if you
carefully follow the statutes and ordinances that the LORD commanded
Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or
discouraged. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now behold, I have taken great pains to
provide for the house of the LORD—100,000 talents of gold,
1,000,000 talents of silver, and bronze and iron too great to be
weighed. I have also provided timber and stone, and you may add to
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You also have many workers: stonecutters,
masons, carpenters, and men skilled in every kind of work— in gold
and silver, bronze and iron—craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the
work, and may the LORD be with you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David ordered all the leaders of
Israel to help his son Solomon: “Is not the LORD your God with you,
and has He not granted you rest on every side? For He has given the
inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued
before the LORD and His people. Now set your heart and soul to seek
the LORD your God. Get started building the sanctuary of the LORD
God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and
the holy articles of God into the temple that will be built for the
Name of the LORD.” </font>
