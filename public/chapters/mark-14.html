<span class="reftext">2</span>“But not during the feast,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Anointed at Bethany<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:6–13; Luke 7:36–50; John 12:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>While Jesus was in Bethany reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper,<span class="fn">b</span>  a woman came with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke open the jar and poured it on Jesus’ head.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Some of those present, however, expressed their indignation to one another: “Why this waste of perfume?
<span class="reftext">5</span>It could have been sold for over three hundred denarii<span class="fn">c</span>  and the money given to the poor.” And they scolded her.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>But Jesus said, <span>“Leave her alone; why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful deed to Me.
<span class="reftext">7</span>The poor you will always have with you,<span class="fn">d</span>  and you can help them whenever you want. But you will not always have Me.
<span class="reftext">8</span>She has done what she could to anoint My body in advance of My burial.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:14–16; Luke 22:3–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.
<span class="reftext">11</span>They were delighted to hear this, and they promised to give him money. </p><p class="reg1"> So Judas began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus.
</p><p class="hdg">Preparing the Passover<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:17–19; Luke 22:7–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,<span class="fn">e</span>  when the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed, Jesus’ disciples asked Him, “Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So He sent two of His disciples and told them, <span>“Go into the city, and a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him,
<span class="reftext">14</span>and whichever house he enters, say to the owner, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is My guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’
<span class="reftext">15</span>And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>So the disciples left and went into the city, where they found everything as Jesus had described. And they prepared the Passover.
</p><p class="hdg">The Last Supper<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:20–30; Luke 22:14–23; 1 Corinthians 11:17–34)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And while they were reclining and eating, Jesus said, <span>“Truly I tell you, one of you who is eating with Me will betray Me.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>They began to be grieved and to ask Him one after another, “Surely not I?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>He answered, <span>“It is one of the Twelve—the one who is dipping his hand<span class="fn">f</span>  into the bowl with Me.
<span class="reftext">21</span>The Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, <span>“Take it; this is My body.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
<span class="reftext">24</span>He said to them, <span>“This is My blood of the covenant,<span class="fn">g</span>  which is poured out for many.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Truly I tell you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Zechariah 13:7–9; Matthew 26:31–35; Luke 22:31–38; John 13:36–38)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span>“You will all fall away,<span class="fn">h</span>  for it is written:</span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘I will strike the Shepherd, </p><p class="indentred"> and the sheep will be scattered.’<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Peter declared, “Even if all fall away, I never will.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">30</span>“Truly I tell you,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>But Peter kept insisting, “Even if I have to die with You, I will never deny You.” And all the others said the same thing.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Prays at Gethsemane<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:36–46; Luke 22:39–46)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Then they came to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus told His disciples, <span>“Sit here while I pray.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>He took with Him Peter, James, and John, and began to be deeply troubled and distressed.
<span class="reftext">34</span>Then He said to them, <span>“My soul is consumed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Going a little farther, He fell to the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour would pass from Him.
<span><span class="reftext">36</span>“Abba, Father,”</span> He said, <span>“all things are possible for You. Take this cup from Me. Yet not what I will, but what You will.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>Then Jesus returned and found them sleeping. <span>“Simon, are you asleep?”</span> He asked. <span>“Were you not able to keep watch for one hour?
<span class="reftext">38</span>Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Again He went away and prayed, saying the same thing.
<span class="reftext">40</span>And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping—for their eyes were heavy. And they did not know what to answer Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>When Jesus returned the third time, He said, <span>“Are you still sleeping and resting? That is enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
<span class="reftext">42</span>Rise, let us go. See, My betrayer is approaching!”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Betrayal of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:47–56; Luke 22:47–53; John 18:1–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, scribes, and elders.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him and lead Him away securely.”
<span class="reftext">45</span>Going directly to Jesus, he said, “Rabbi!” and kissed Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>Then the men seized Jesus and arrested Him.
<span class="reftext">47</span>And one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">48</span>Jesus asked the crowd, <span>“Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an outlaw?
<span class="reftext">49</span>Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts,<span class="fn">j</span>  and you did not arrest Me. But this has happened that the Scriptures would be fulfilled.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>Then everyone deserted Him and fled.
<span class="reftext">51</span>One young man who had been following Jesus was wearing a linen cloth around his body. They caught hold of him,
<span class="reftext">52</span>but he pulled free of the linen cloth and ran away naked.
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus before the Sanhedrin<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:57–68; Luke 22:66–71; John 18:19–24)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">53</span>They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders, and scribes assembled.
<span class="reftext">54</span>Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the officers and warmed himself by the fire.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">55</span>Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin<span class="fn">k</span>  were seeking testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but they did not find any.
<span class="reftext">56</span>For many bore false witness against Jesus, but their testimony was inconsistent.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">57</span>Then some men stood up and testified falsely against Him:
<span class="reftext">58</span>“We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this man-made temple, and in three days I will build another that is made without hands.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
<span class="reftext">59</span>But even their testimony was inconsistent.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">60</span>So the high priest stood up before them and questioned Jesus, “Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">61</span>But Jesus remained silent and made no reply. </p><p class="reg1"> Again the high priest questioned Him, “Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">62</span>“I am,”</span> said Jesus, <span>“and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power<span class="fn">l</span>  and coming with the clouds of heaven.”</span><span class="fn">m</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">63</span>At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “Why do we need any more witnesses?
<span class="reftext">64</span>You have heard the blasphemy. What is your verdict?” </p><p class="reg1"> And they all condemned Him as deserving of death.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">65</span>Then some of them began to spit on Him. They blindfolded Him, struck Him with their fists, and said to Him, “Prophesy!” And the officers received Him with slaps in His face.
</p><p class="hdg">Peter Denies Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 26:69–75; Luke 22:54–62; John 18:15–18)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">66</span>While Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the servant girls of the high priest came down
<span class="reftext">67</span>and saw him warming himself there. She looked at Peter and said, “You also were with Jesus the Nazarene.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">68</span>But he denied it. “I do not know or even understand what you are talking about,” he said. Then he went out to the gateway, and the rooster crowed.<span class="fn">n</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">69</span>There the servant girl saw him and again said to those standing nearby, “This man is one of them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">70</span>But he denied it again. </p><p class="reg1"> After a little while, those standing nearby said once more to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for you too are a Galilean.”<span class="fn">o</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">71</span>But he began to curse and swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak!”
<span class="reftext">72</span>And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. </p><p class="reg1"> Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken to him: <span>“Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.”</span> And he broke down and wept.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">and the Unleavened</i>; see Exodus 12:14–20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Aramaic <i class="calibre6">Simon the Potter</i> or <i class="calibre6">Simon the Jar Maker</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> A denarius was customarily a day’s wage for a laborer; see Matthew 20:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> See Deuteronomy 15:11.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">On the first day of the Unleavened</i>; see Exodus 12:14–20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the one who is dipping</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">the new covenant</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">on account of Me this night</i>; see Matthew 26:31.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Zechariah 13:7<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">49</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">55</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the whole Council</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">62</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the right hand of the Mighty One</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">62</span> <span class="footnotesbot">m</span> See Psalm 110:1 and Daniel 7:13.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">68</span> <span class="footnotesbot">n</span> NE and WH do not include <i class="calibre6">and the rooster crowed</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">70</span> <span class="footnotesbot">o</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">and your speech is similar</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
