<font ><b>The Last Supper</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Passover and the Feast of
Unleavened Bread were two days away, and the chief priests and
scribes were looking for a covert way to arrest Jesus and kill Him.
“But not during the feast,” they said, “or there may be a riot
among the people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Jesus was in Bethany reclining at
the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an
alabaster jar of expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke open
the jar and poured it on Jesus’ head. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some of those present, however, expressed
their indignation to one another: “Why this waste of perfume? It
could have been sold for over three hundred denarii and the money
given to the poor.” And they scolded her. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“Leave
her alone; why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful deed
to Me. The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them
whenever you want. But you will not always have Me. She has done what
she could to anoint My body in advance of My burial. And truly I tell
you, wherever the gospel is preached in all the world, what she has
done will also be told in memory of her.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve,
went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. They were
delighted to hear this, and they promised to give him money. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Judas began to look for an opportunity
to betray Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the first day of the Feast of
Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed, Jesus’
disciples asked Him, “Where do You want us to prepare for You to
eat the Passover?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So He sent two of His disciples and told
them, <font color="#a80000">“Go into the city, and a man carrying a
jug of water will meet you. Follow him, and whichever house he
enters, say to the owner, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is My guest
room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?’ And he will
show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations
for us there.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the disciples left and went into the
city, where they found everything as Jesus had described. And they
prepared the Passover. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When evening came, Jesus arrived with the
Twelve. And while they were reclining and eating, Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“Truly
I tell you, one of you who is eating with Me will betray Me.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They began to be grieved and to ask Him
one after another, “Surely not I?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He answered, <font color="#a80000">“It
is one of the Twelve—the one who is dipping his hand into the bowl
with Me. The Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but
woe to that man by whom He is betrayed! It would be better for him if
he had not been born.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While they were eating, Jesus took bread,
spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying,
<font color="#a80000">“Take it; this is My body.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and
gave it to them, and they all drank from it. He said to them, <font color="#a80000">“This
is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. Truly I
tell you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that
day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when they had sung a hymn, they went
out to the Mount of Olives. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“You
will all fall away, for it is written:</font> </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >I will strike the
Shepherd, </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >and the sheep will
be scattered.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But after I have
risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter declared, “Even if all fall away,
I never will.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Truly I tell
you,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“this very
night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Peter kept insisting, “Even if I
have to die with You, I will never deny You.” And all the others
said the same thing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they came to a place called
Gethsemane, and Jesus told His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“Sit
here while I pray.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He took with Him Peter, James, and John,
and began to be deeply troubled and distressed. Then He said to them,
<font color="#a80000">“My soul is consumed with sorrow to the point
of death. Stay here and keep watch.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Going a little farther, He fell to the
ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour would pass from
Him. <font color="#a80000">“Abba, Father,”</font> He said, <font color="#a80000">“all
things are possible for You. Take this cup from Me. Yet not what I
will, but what You will.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus returned and found them
sleeping. <font color="#a80000">“Simon, are you asleep?”</font>
He asked. <font color="#a80000">“Were you not able to keep watch
for one hour? Watch and pray so that you will not enter into
temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again He went away and prayed, saying the
same thing. And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping—for
their eyes were heavy. And they did not know what to answer Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus returned the third time, He
said, <font color="#a80000">“Are you still sleeping and resting?
That is enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed
into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us go. See, My betrayer is
approaching!”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one
of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd armed with swords and
clubs, sent from the chief priests, scribes, and elders. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the betrayer had arranged a signal
with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him and lead Him away
securely.” Going directly to Jesus, he said, “Rabbi!” and
kissed Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the men seized Jesus and arrested
Him. And one of the bystanders drew his sword and struck the servant
of the high priest, cutting off his ear. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus asked the crowd, <font color="#a80000">“Have
you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an
outlaw? Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and
you did not arrest Me. But this has happened that the Scriptures
would be fulfilled.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then everyone deserted Him and fled. One
young man who had been following Jesus was wearing a linen cloth
around his body. They caught hold of him, but he pulled free of the
linen cloth and ran away naked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They led Jesus away to the high priest,
and all the chief priests, elders, and scribes assembled. Peter
followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high
priest. And he sat with the officers and warmed himself by the fire. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the chief priests and the whole
Sanhedrin were seeking testimony against Jesus to put Him to death,
but they did not find any. For many bore false witness against Jesus,
but their testimony was inconsistent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then some men stood up and testified
falsely against Him: “We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this
man-made temple, and in three days I will build another that is made
without hands.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
But even their testimony was inconsistent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the high priest stood up before them
and questioned Jesus, “Have You no answer? What are these men
testifying against You?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus remained silent and made no
reply. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again the high priest questioned Him, “Are
You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >I am,”</font>
said Jesus, <font color="#a80000">“and you will see the Son of Man
sitting at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of
heaven.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, the high priest tore his clothes
and declared, “Why do we need any more witnesses? You have heard
the blasphemy. What is your verdict?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And they all condemned Him as deserving of
death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then some of them began to spit on Him.
They blindfolded Him, struck Him with their fists, and said to Him,
“Prophesy!” And the officers received Him with slaps in His face.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Peter was in the courtyard below,
one of the servant girls of the high priest came down and saw him
warming himself there. She looked at Peter and said, “You also were
with Jesus the Nazarene.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But he denied it. “I do not know or even
understand what you are talking about,” he said. Then he went out
to the gateway, and the rooster crowed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There the servant girl saw him and again
said to those standing nearby, “This man is one of them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But he denied it again. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After a little while, those standing
nearby said once more to Peter, “Surely you are one of them, for
you too are a Galilean.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But he began to curse and swear, “I do
not know this man of whom you speak!” And immediately the rooster
crowed a second time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus
had spoken to him: <font color="#a80000">“Before the rooster crows
twice, you will deny Me three times.”</font> And he broke down and
wept. </font>
