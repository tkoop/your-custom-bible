<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Evil in the Last Days</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>But understand this: In the last days terrible times will come.
<span class="reftext">2</span>For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
<span class="reftext">3</span>unloving, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, without love of good,
<span class="reftext">4</span>traitorous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
<span class="reftext">5</span>having a form of godliness but denying its power. Turn away from such as these!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>They are the kind who worm their way into households and captivate vulnerable women who are weighed down with sins and led astray by various passions,
<span class="reftext">7</span>who are always learning but never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,<span class="fn">a</span>  so also these men oppose the truth. They are depraved in mind and disqualified from the faith.
<span class="reftext">9</span>But they will not advance much further. For just like Jannes and Jambres, their folly will be plain to everyone.
</p><p class="hdg">All Scripture Is God-Breathed<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Hebrews 4:12–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>You, however, have observed my teaching, my conduct, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my perseverance,
<span class="reftext">11</span>my persecutions, and the sufferings that came upon me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Indeed, all who desire to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,
<span class="reftext">13</span>while evil men and imposters go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>But as for you, continue in the things you have learned and firmly believed, since you know from whom you have learned them.
<span class="reftext">15</span>From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
<span class="reftext">16</span>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for instruction, for conviction, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
<span class="reftext">17</span>so that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> See Jasher 79:27. <i class="calibre6">The Book of Jashar</i> or <i class="calibre6">the Book of the Upright One</i> is often cited as <i class="calibre6">Jasher</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
