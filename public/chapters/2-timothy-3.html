<font >But understand this: In the last days
terrible times will come. For men will be lovers of themselves,
lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their
parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderous,
without self-control, brutal, without love of good, traitorous,
reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
having a form of godliness but denying its power. Turn away from such
as these! </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They are the kind who worm their way into
households and captivate vulnerable women who are weighed down with
sins and led astray by various passions, who are always learning but
never able to come to a knowledge of the truth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,
so also these men oppose the truth. They are depraved in mind and
disqualified from the faith. But they will not advance much further.
For just like Jannes and Jambres, their folly will be plain to
everyone. </font>

<font >You, however, have observed my teaching,
my conduct, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my
perseverance, my persecutions, and the sufferings that came upon me
in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the
Lord rescued me from all of them. Indeed, all who desire to live
godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evil men and
imposters go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But as for you, continue in the things you
have learned and firmly believed, since you know from whom you have
learned them. From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which
are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ
Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for instruction,
for conviction, for correction, and for training in righteousness, so
that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good
work. </font>
