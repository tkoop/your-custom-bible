</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Preserve my soul, for I am godly. </p><p class="indent"> You are my God; save Your servant who trusts in You.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Be merciful to me, O Lord, </p><p class="indent"> for I call to You all day long.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Bring joy to Your servant, </p><p class="indent"> for to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>For You, O Lord, are kind and forgiving, </p><p class="indent"> rich in loving devotion to all who call on You.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>In the day of my distress I call on You, </p><p class="indent"> because You answer me.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>O Lord, there is none like You among the gods, </p><p class="indent"> nor any works like Yours.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>All the nations You have made </p><p class="indent"> will come and bow before You, O Lord, </p><p class="indent"> and they will glorify Your name.

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>The arrogant rise against me, O God; </p><p class="indent"> a band of ruthless men seeks my life, </p><p class="indent"> with no regard for You.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>But You, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, </p><p class="indent"> slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>Turn to me and have mercy; </p><p class="indent"> grant Your strength to Your servant; </p><p class="indent"> save the son of Your maidservant.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Show me a sign of Your goodness, </p><p class="indent"> that my enemies may see and be ashamed; </p><p class="indent"> for You, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em">Â </p></div>
