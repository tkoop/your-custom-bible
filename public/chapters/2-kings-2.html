<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Elijah Taken Up to Heaven</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Shortly before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> took Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal,
<span class="reftext">2</span>and Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has sent me on to Bethel.” </p><p class="reg1"> But Elisha replied, “As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” </p><p class="reg1"> So they went down to Bethel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then the sons of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said, “Do you know that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will take your master away from you today?” </p><p class="reg1">“Yes, I know,” he replied. “Do not speak of it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has sent me on to Jericho.” </p><p class="reg1"> But Elisha replied, “As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” </p><p class="reg1"> So they went to Jericho.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then the sons of the prophets at Jericho came up to Elisha and said, “Do you know that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will take your master away from you today?” </p><p class="reg1">“Yes, I know,” he replied. “Do not speak of it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>And Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has sent me on to the Jordan.” </p><p class="reg1"> But Elisha replied, “As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.” </p><p class="reg1"> So the two of them went on.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then a company of fifty of the sons of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing Elijah and Elisha as the two of them stood by the Jordan.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the waters, which parted to the right and to the left, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>After they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken away from you?” </p><p class="reg1">“Please, let me inherit a double portion of your spirit,” Elisha replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>“You have requested a difficult thing,” said Elijah. “Nevertheless, if you see me as I am taken from you, it will be yours. But if not, then it will not be so.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up into heaven in a whirlwind.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>As Elisha watched, he cried out, “My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!” And he saw Elijah no more. So taking hold of his own clothes, he tore them in two.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Elisha also picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah, and he went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Then he took the cloak of Elijah that had fallen from him and struck the waters. “Where now is <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Elijah?” he asked. </p><p class="reg1"> And when he had struck the waters, they parted to the right and to the left, and Elisha crossed over.
</p><p class="hdg">Elisha Succeeds Elijah</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>When the sons of the prophets who were facing him from Jericho saw what had happened, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” And they went to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>“Look now,” they said to Elisha, “we your servants have fifty valiant men. Please let them go and search for your master. Perhaps the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has taken him up and put him on one of the mountains or in one of the valleys.” </p><p class="reg1">“Do not send them,” Elisha replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>But when they pressed him to the point of embarrassment, he said, “Send them.” </p><p class="reg1"> And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find Elijah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, “Didn’t I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not to go?”
</p><p class="hdg">Elisha Heals the Waters of Jericho</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then the men of the city said to Elisha, “Please note, our lord, that the city’s location is good, as you can see. But the water is bad and the land is unfruitful.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>“Bring me a new bowl,” he replied, “and put some salt in it.” </p><p class="reg1"> So they brought it to him,
<span class="reftext">21</span>and Elisha went out to the spring, cast the salt into it, and said, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: ‘I have healed this water. No longer will it cause death or unfruitfulness.<span class="fn">a</span>’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And the waters there have been healthy to this day, according to the word spoken by Elisha.
</p><p class="hdg">Elisha Mocked</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>From there, Elisha went up to Bethel, and as he was walking up the road, a group of boys<span class="fn">b</span>  came out of the city and jeered at him, chanting, “Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then he turned around, looked at them, and called down a curse on them in the name of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. </p><p class="reg1"> Suddenly two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>And Elisha went on to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">barrenness</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">some small youths</i> or <i class="calibre6">some insignificant young men</i>; similarly in verse 24<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
