</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>For day after day they seek Me </p><p class="indent"> and delight to know My ways, </p><p class="indent1"> like a nation that does what is right </p><p class="indent"> and does not forsake the justice of their God. </p><p class="indent1"> They ask Me for righteous <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span>; </p><p class="indent"> they delight in the nearness of God.”
