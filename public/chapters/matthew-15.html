Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, “Why do Your disciples break the

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“And
why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?
For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who
curses his father or mother must be put to death.’ But you say that
if anyone says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have
received from me is a gift devoted to God,’ he need not honor his
father or mother with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the
sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly
about you:</font> </font>

not yet realize that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach
and then is eliminated? But the things that come out of the mouth
come from the heart, and these things defile a man. For out of the
heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft,
false testimony, and slander. These are what defile a man, but eating
with unwashed hands does not defile him.”</font> </font>

The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled

the God of Israel. </font>
