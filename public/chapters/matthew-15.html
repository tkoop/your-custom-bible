<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Tradition of the Elders<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 7:1–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,
<span class="reftext">2</span>“Why do <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> disciples break the tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Jesus replied, <span>“And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?
<span class="reftext">4</span>For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’<span class="fn">a</span>  and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.’<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But you say that if anyone says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is a gift devoted to God,’
<span class="reftext">6</span>he need not <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> his father or mother with it.<span class="fn">c</span>  Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.
<span class="reftext">7</span>You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you:</span>
</p><p class="indent1stlinered"><span class="reftext">8</span>‘These people <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> with their lips, </p><p class="indentred"> but their hearts are far from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.
</p><p class="indentred1"><span class="reftext">9</span>They worship <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> in vain; </p><p class="indentred"> they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.’<span class="fn">d</span>”
</p><p class="hdg">What Defiles a Man<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 7:14–23)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Jesus called the crowd to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and said, <span>“Listen and understand.
<span class="reftext">11</span>A man is not defiled by what enters his mouth, but by what comes out of it.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then the disciples came to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and said, “Are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> aware that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But Jesus replied, <span>“Every plant that <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> heavenly <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> has not planted will be pulled up by its roots.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Disregard them! They are blind guides.<span class="fn">e</span>  If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Peter said to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Explain this parable to us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">16</span>“Do you still not understand?”</span> Jesus asked.
<span><span class="reftext">17</span>“Do you not yet <span class='spell ca'>realize</span><span class='spell gb'>realise</span><span class='spell us'>realize</span> that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated?
<span class="reftext">18</span>But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a man.
<span class="reftext">19</span>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.
<span class="reftext">20</span>These are what defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Faith of the Canaanite Woman<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 7:24–30)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.
<span class="reftext">22</span>And a Canaanite woman from that region came to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But Jesus did not answer a word. So <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples came and urged <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>He answered, <span>“I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>The woman came and knelt before <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. “Lord, help me!” she said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>But Jesus replied, <span>“It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>“Yes, Lord,” she said, “even the dogs<span class="fn">f</span>  eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">28</span>“O woman,”</span> Jesus answered, <span>“your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that very hour.

Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> went up on a mountain and sat down.
<span class="reftext">30</span>Large crowds came to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> feet, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> healed them.
<span class="reftext">31</span>The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Then Jesus called <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and said, <span>“I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint along the way.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>The disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could we find enough bread to feed such a large crowd?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">34</span>“How many loaves do you have?”</span> Jesus asked. </p><p class="reg1">“Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Taking the seven loaves and the fish, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> gave thanks and broke them. Then <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
<span class="reftext">38</span>A total of four thousand men were fed, in addition to women and children.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> NE and TR (see also Mark 7:12); literally <i class="calibre6">he need not <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span> his father or mother</i>; SBL, NA, WH, and BYZ do not include <i class="calibre6">or mother</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Isaiah 29:13 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">blind guides of the blind</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Or <i class="calibre6">puppies</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
