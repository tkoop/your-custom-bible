<font >Then some Pharisees and scribes came to
Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, “Why do Your disciples break the
tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands before they
eat.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“And
why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?
For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Anyone who
curses his father or mother must be put to death.’ But you say that
if anyone says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have
received from me is a gift devoted to God,’ he need not honor his
father or mother with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the
sake of your tradition. You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly
about you:</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000">‘<font >These people
honor Me with their lips, </font></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >but their hearts are
far from Me. </font></font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >They worship Me in
vain; </font></font>

doctrine the precepts of men.’” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus called the crowd to Him and said,
<font color="#a80000">“Listen and understand. A man is not defiled
by what enters his mouth, but by what comes out of it.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the disciples came to Him and said,
“Are You aware that the Pharisees were offended when they heard
this?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Every
plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by
its roots. Disregard them! They are blind guides. If a blind man
leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter said to Him, “Explain this parable
to us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Do you still not
understand?”</font> Jesus asked. <font color="#a80000">“Do you
not yet realize that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach
and then is eliminated? But the things that come out of the mouth
come from the heart, and these things defile a man. For out of the
heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft,
false testimony, and slander. These are what defile a man, but eating
with unwashed hands does not defile him.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the
district of Tyre and Sidon. And a Canaanite woman from that region
came to Him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My
daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus did not answer a word. So His
disciples came and urged Him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying
out after us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He answered, <font color="#a80000">“I
was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The woman came and knelt before Him.
“Lord, help me!” she said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“It
is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Yes, Lord,” she said, “even the
dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >O woman,”</font>
Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“your faith is great! Let it
be done for you as you desire.”</font> And her daughter was healed
from that very hour. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moving on from there, Jesus went along the
Sea of Galilee. Then He went up on a mountain and sat down. Large
crowds came to Him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the
mute, and many others, and laid them at His feet, and He healed them.
The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled
restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified
the God of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and
said, <font color="#a80000">“I have compassion for this crowd,
because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to
eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint along
the way.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The disciples replied, “Where in this
desolate place could we find enough bread to feed such a large
crowd?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >How many loaves
do you have?”</font> Jesus asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Seven,” they replied, “and a few
small fish.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And He instructed the crowd to sit down on
the ground. Taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks and
broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples
gave them to the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They all ate and were satisfied, and the
disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left
over. A total of four thousand men were fed, in addition to women and
children. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He
got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan. </font>
