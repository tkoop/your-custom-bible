And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Beloved, we are now children of God, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that when Christ appears,<span class="fn">a</span>  we will be like <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, for we will see <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> is.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And everyone who has this hope in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> purifies himself, just as Christ is pure.<span class="fn">b</span>

<span class="reftext">5</span>But <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> know that Christ appeared to take away sins, and in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> there is no sin.
<span class="reftext">6</span>No one who remains in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has seen <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> or known <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.

<span class="reftext">8</span>The one <span class='spell ca'>who practises</span><span class='spell gb'>who practises</span><span class='spell us'>who practices</span> sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the very start. This is why the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of God was revealed, to destroy the works of the devil.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Anyone born of God refuses <span class='spell ca'>to practise</span><span class='spell gb'>to practise</span><span class='spell us'>to practice</span> sin, because God’s seed abides in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.
<span class="reftext">10</span>By this the children of God are distinguished from the children of the devil: Anyone who <span class='spell ca'>does not practise</span><span class='spell gb'>does not practise</span><span class='spell us'>does not practice</span> righteousness is not of God, nor is anyone who does not love his brother.

<span class="reftext">12</span>Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did Cain slay him? Because his own deeds were evil, while those of his brother were righteous.
<span class="reftext">13</span>So do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers. The one who does not love remains in death.

<span class="reftext">23</span>And this is <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> commandment: that we should believe in the name of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span>, Jesus Christ, and we should love one another just as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> commanded us.
