<font >Now I assembled these exiles at the canal
that flows to Ahava, and we camped there three days. And when I
searched among the people and priests, I found no Levites there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I summoned the leaders: Eliezer,
Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and
Meshullam, as well as the teachers Joiarib and Elnathan. And I sent
them to Iddo, the leader at Casiphia, with a message for him and his
kinsmen, the temple servants at Casiphia, that they should bring to
us ministers for the house of our God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And since the gracious hand of our God was
upon us, they brought us Sherebiah—a man of insight from the
descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel—along with his
sons and brothers, 18 men; also Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah,
from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and their sons, 20
men. They also brought 220 of the temple servants, all designated by
name. David and the officials had appointed them to assist the
Levites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And there by the Ahava Canal I proclaimed
a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask Him
for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.
For I was ashamed to ask the king for an escort of soldiers and
horsemen to protect us from our enemies on the road, since we had
told him, “The hand of our God is gracious to all who seek Him, but
His great anger is against all who forsake Him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So we fasted and petitioned our God about
this, and He granted our request. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I set apart twelve of the leading
priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their
brothers, and I weighed out to them the contribution of silver and
gold and the articles that the king, his counselors, his leaders, and
all the Israelites there had offered for the house of our God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I weighed out into their hands 650 talents
of silver, articles of silver weighing 100 talents, 100 talents of
gold, 20 gold bowls valued at 1,000 darics, and two articles of fine
polished bronze, as precious as gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I told them, “You are holy to the
LORD, and these articles are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill
offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers. Guard them carefully
until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the LORD in
Jerusalem before the leading priests, Levites, and heads of the
Israelite families.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the priests and Levites took charge of
the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to
be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the twelfth day of the first month we
set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem, and the hand of our
God was upon us to protect us from the hands of the enemies and
bandits along the way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So we arrived at Jerusalem and rested
there for three days. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the fourth day, in the house of our
God, we weighed out the silver and gold and sacred articles into the
hand of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas
was with him, along with the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and
Noadiah son of Binnui. Everything was verified by number and weight,
and the total weight was recorded at that time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the exiles who had returned from
captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls
for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, and a sin offering of 12 male
goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They also delivered the king’s edicts to
the royal satraps and governors of the region west of the Euphrates,
who proceeded to assist the people and the house of God. </font>
