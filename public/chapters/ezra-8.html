</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>from the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom; </p><p class="list1stline"> from the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel; </p><p class="list1stline"> from the descendants of David, Hattush
<span class="reftext">3</span>of the descendants of Shecaniah; </p><p class="list1stline"> from the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered 150 men;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>from the descendants of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>from the descendants of Zattu, Shecaniah son of Jahaziel,<span class="fn">a</span>  and with him 300 men;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>from the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>from the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>from the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him 80 men;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>from the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>from the descendants of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah,<span class="fn">b</span>  and with him 160 men;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">11</span>from the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him 28 men;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>from the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>from the later<span class="fn">c</span>  descendants of Adonikam, these were their names: Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men;
</p><p class="list1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>and from the descendants of Bigvai, both Uthai and Zaccur,<span class="fn">d</span>  and with them 70 men.
</p><p class="hdg">Ezra Sends for the Levites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now I assembled these exiles at the canal that flows to Ahava, and we camped there three days. And when I searched among the people and priests, I found no Levites there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then I summoned the leaders: Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan,<span class="fn">e</span>  Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, as well as the teachers Joiarib and Elnathan.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And I sent them to Iddo, the leader at Casiphia, with a message for him and his kinsmen, the temple servants<span class="fn">f</span>  at Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And since the gracious hand of our God was upon us, they brought us Sherebiah—a man of insight from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel—along with his sons and brothers, 18 men;
<span class="reftext">19</span>also Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah, from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and their sons, 20 men.
<span class="reftext">20</span>They also brought 220 of the temple servants, all designated by name. David and the officials had appointed them to assist the Levites.
</p><p class="hdg">Fasting for Protection</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>And there by the Ahava <span class='cap'>Canal</span><span class='nocap'>canal</span> I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.
<span class="reftext">22</span>For I was ashamed to ask the king for an escort of soldiers and horsemen to protect us from our enemies on the road, since we had told him, “The hand of our God is gracious to all who seek <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, but <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> great anger is against all who forsake <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> granted our request.
</p><p class="hdg">Priests to Guard the Offerings</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers,
<span class="reftext">25</span>and I weighed out to them the contribution of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his counselors, his leaders, and all the Israelites there had offered for the house of our God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>I weighed out into their hands 650 talents of silver,<span class="fn">g</span>  articles of silver weighing 100 talents,<span class="fn">h</span>  100 talents of gold,<span class="fn">i</span> 
<span class="reftext">27</span>20 gold bowls valued at 1,000 darics,<span class="fn">j</span>  and two articles of fine polished bronze, as precious as gold.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then I told them, “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are holy to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and these articles are holy. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Guard them carefully until <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> weigh them out in the chambers of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> in Jerusalem before the leading priests, Levites, and heads of the Israelite families.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>So the priests and Levites took charge of the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava <span class='cap'>Canal</span><span class='nocap'>canal</span> to go to Jerusalem, and the hand of our God was upon us to protect us from the hands of the enemies and bandits along the way.
</p><p class="hdg">Arrival in Jerusalem</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>So we arrived at Jerusalem and rested there for three days.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and sacred articles into the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, along with the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.
<span class="reftext">34</span>Everything was verified by number and weight, and the total weight was recorded at that time.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: 12 bulls for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, and a sin offering of 12 male goats. All this was a burnt offering to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>They also delivered the king’s edicts to the royal satraps<span class="fn">k</span>  and governors of the region west of the Euphrates,<span class="fn">l</span>  who proceeded to assist the people and the house of God.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Some LXX manuscripts (see also 1 Esdras 8:32); Hebrew <i class="calibre6">from the descendants of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Some LXX manuscripts (see also 1 Esdras 8:36); Hebrew <i class="calibre6">from the descendants of Shelomith, the son of Josiphiah</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the last</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> LXX, Syriac, and an alternate MT reading; the other alternate reads <i class="calibre6">Zabbud</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Elnathan</i> appears three times in verse, either as a repetition for emphasis or as a record of multiple men with this name.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the Nethinim</i>; also in verse 20<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> <i class="calibre6">650 talents</i> is approximately 24.5 tons or 22.2 metric tons of silver.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">100 talents</i> is approximately 3.77 tons or 3.42 metric tons of silver articles.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> <i class="calibre6">100 talents</i> is approximately 3.77 tons or 3.42 metric tons of gold.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Or <i class="calibre6">worth 1,000 drachmas</i>; that is, approximately 18.5 pounds or 8.4 kilograms of gold<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> A <i class="calibre6">satrap</i> was a Persian official.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">governors beyond the River</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
