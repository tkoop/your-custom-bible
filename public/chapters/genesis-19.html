19</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the two angels arrived at Sodom in the
evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When Lot saw
them, he got up to meet them, bowed facedown, and said, “My lords,
please turn aside into the house of your servant; wash your feet and
spend the night. Then you can rise early and go on your way.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">No,” they answered, “we will spend
the night in the square.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Lot insisted so strongly that they
followed him into his house. He prepared a feast for them and baked
unleavened bread, and they ate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Before they had gone to bed, all the men
of the city of Sodom, both young and old, surrounded the house. They
called out to Lot, saying, “Where are the men who came to you
tonight? Send them out to us so we can have relations with them!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Lot went outside to meet them, shutting
the door behind him. “Please, my brothers,” he pleaded, “don’t
do such a wicked thing! Look, I have two daughters who have never
slept with a man. Let me bring them to you, and you can do to them as
you please. But do not do anything to these men, for they have come
under the protection of my roof.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Get out of the way!” they replied.
And they declared, “This one came here as a foreigner, and he is
already acting like a judge! Now we will treat you worse than them.”
And they pressed in on Lot and moved in to break down the door. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the men inside reached out, pulled Lot
into the house with them, and shut the door. And they struck the men
at the entrance, young and old, with blindness, so that they wearied
themselves trying to find the door. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the two men said to Lot, “Do you
have anyone else here—a son-in-law, your sons or daughters, or
anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here,
because we are about to destroy this place. For the outcry to the
LORD against its people is so great that He has sent us to destroy
it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Lot went out and spoke to the
sons-in-law who were pledged in marriage to his daughters. “Get
up,” he said. “Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to
destroy the city!” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At daybreak the angels hurried Lot along,
saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are
here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.” But
when Lot hesitated, the men grabbed his hand and the hands of his
wife and his two daughters. And they led them safely out of the city,
because of the LORD’s compassion for them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As soon as the men had brought them out,
one of them said, “Run for your lives! Do not look back, and do not
stop anywhere on the plain! Flee to the mountains, or you will be
swept away!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Lot replied, “No, my lords, please!
Your servant has indeed found favor in your sight, and you have shown
me great kindness by sparing my life. But I cannot run to the
mountains; the disaster will overtake me, and I will die. Look, there
is a town nearby where I can flee, and it is a small place. Please
let me flee there—is it not a small place? Then my life will be
saved.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Very well,” he answered, “I will
grant this request as well, and will not demolish the town you
indicate. Hurry! Run there quickly, for I cannot do anything until
you reach it.” That is why the town was called Zoar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And by the time the sun had risen over the
land, Lot had reached Zoar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD rained down sulfur and fire
on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the heavens. Thus He
destroyed these cities and the entire plain, including all the
inhabitants of the cities and everything that grew on the ground. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Lot’s wife looked back, and she
became a pillar of salt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Early the next morning, Abraham got up and
returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD. He looked
down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain, and he
saw the smoke rising from the land like smoke from a furnace. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So when God destroyed the cities of the
plain, He remembered Abraham, and He brought Lot out of the
catastrophe that destroyed the cities where he had lived. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and
settled in the mountains—for he was afraid to stay in Zoar—where
they lived in a cave. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">One day the older daughter said to the
younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to
sleep with us, as is the custom over all the earth. Come, let us get
our father drunk with wine so we can sleep with him and preserve his
line.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So that night they got their father drunk
with wine, and the firstborn went in and slept with her father; he
was not aware when she lay down or when she got up. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The next day the older daughter said to
the younger, “Look, I slept with my father last night. Let us get
him drunk with wine again tonight so you can go in and sleep with him
and we can preserve our father’s line.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So again that night they got their father
drunk with wine, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him;
he was not aware when she lay down or when she got up. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Thus both of Lot’s daughters became
pregnant by their father. The older daughter gave birth to a son and
named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites of today. The
younger daughter also gave birth to a son, and she named him
Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites of today. </font>
