</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>So David inquired of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “Should I go and attack these Philistines?” </p><p class="reg1"> And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>But David’s men said to him, “Look, we are afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Once again, David inquired of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> answered him: “Go at once to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then David and his men went to Keilah, fought against the Philistines, and carried off their livestock, striking them with a mighty blow. So David saved the people of Keilah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the ephod with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)
</p><p class="hdg">Saul Pursues David<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 54:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>When Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, he said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he has trapped himself by entering a town with gates and bars.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Saul summoned all his troops to go to war at Keilah and besiege David and his men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>And David said, “O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, God of Israel, Your servant has heard that Saul intends to come to Keilah and destroy the city on my account.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me into his hand?<span class="fn">a</span>  Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, God of Israel, please tell Your servant.” </p><p class="reg1">“He will,” said <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” </p><p class="reg1">“They will,” said <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then David and his men, about six hundred strong, set out and departed from Keilah, moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he declined to go forth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God would not deliver David into his hand.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>While David was in Horesh in the Wilderness of Ziph, he saw that Saul had come out to take his life.
<span class="reftext">16</span>And Saul’s son Jonathan came to David in Horesh and strengthened his hand in God,
<span class="reftext">17</span>saying, “Do not be afraid, for my father Saul will never lay a hand on you. And you will be king over Israel, and I will be your second-in-command. Even my father Saul knows this is true.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>So the two of them made a covenant before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. And David remained in Horesh, while Jonathan went home.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon?
<span class="reftext">20</span>Now, O king, come down whenever your soul desires, and we will be responsible for delivering him into your hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>“May you be blessed by <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>,” replied Saul, “for you have had compassion on me.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Please go and prepare further. Investigate and watch carefully where he goes and who has seen him there, for I am told that he is extremely cunning.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Observe and find out all the places where he hides. Then come back to me with certainty, and I will go with you. If he is in the land, I will search him out among all the clans of Judah.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon,
<span class="reftext">25</span>and Saul and his men went to seek him. When David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard of this, he pursued David there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Saul was proceeding along one side of the mountain, and David and his men along the other side. Even though David was hurrying to get away, Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly, for the Philistines have raided the land!”
<span class="reftext">28</span>So Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why that place is called Sela-hammahlekoth.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En-gedi.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Some manuscripts omit this question.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Sela-hammahlekoth</i> means <i class="calibre6">Rock of Escape</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
