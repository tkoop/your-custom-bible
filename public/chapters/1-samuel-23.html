<font ><b>Saul Pursues David</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now it was reported to David, “Look, the
Philistines are fighting against Keilah and looting the threshing
floors.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David inquired of the LORD, “Should I
go and attack these Philistines?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to David, “Go and
attack the Philistines and save Keilah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But David’s men said to him, “Look, we
are afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against
the armies of the Philistines?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once again, David inquired of the LORD,
and the LORD answered him: “Go at once to Keilah, for I will
deliver the Philistines into your hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David and his men went to Keilah,
fought against the Philistines, and carried off their livestock,
striking them with a mighty blow. So David saved the people of
Keilah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought
the ephod with him when he fled to David at Keilah.) </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Saul was told that David had gone to
Keilah, he said, “God has delivered him into my hand, for he has
trapped himself by entering a town with gates and bars.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Saul summoned all his troops to go to
war at Keilah and besiege David and his men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When David learned that Saul was plotting
evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the
ephod.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David said, “O LORD, God of Israel,
Your servant has heard that Saul intends to come to Keilah and
destroy the city on my account. Will the citizens of Keilah surrender
me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O
LORD, God of Israel, please tell Your servant.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >He will,” said the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So David asked, “Will the citizens of
Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >They will,” said the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then David and his men, about six hundred
strong, set out and departed from Keilah, moving from place to place.
When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he declined to
go forth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David stayed in the wilderness
strongholds and in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Day
after day Saul searched for him, but God would not deliver David into
his hand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While David was in Horesh in the
Wilderness of Ziph, he saw that Saul had come out to take his life.
And Saul’s son Jonathan came to David in Horesh and strengthened
his hand in God, saying, “Do not be afraid, for my father Saul will
never lay a hand on you. And you will be king over Israel, and I will
be your second-in-command. Even my father Saul knows this is true.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the two of them made a covenant before
the LORD. And David remained in Horesh, while Jonathan went home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Ziphites came up to Saul at
Gibeah and said, “Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds
at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon? Now, O king,
come down whenever your soul desires, and we will be responsible for
delivering him into your hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >May you be blessed by the LORD,”
replied Saul, “for you have had compassion on me. Please go and
prepare further. Investigate and watch carefully where he goes and
who has seen him there, for I am told that he is extremely cunning.
Observe and find out all the places where he hides. Then come back to
me with certainty, and I will go with you. If he is in the land, I
will search him out among all the clans of Judah.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of
Saul. Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon in the
Arabah south of Jeshimon, and Saul and his men went to seek him. When
David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the
Wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard of this, he pursued David
there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Saul was proceeding along one side of the
mountain, and David and his men along the other side. Even though
David was hurrying to get away, Saul and his men were closing in on
David and his men to capture them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a messenger came to Saul, saying,
“Come quickly, for the Philistines have raided the land!” So Saul
broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That
is why that place is called Sela-hammahlekoth. And David went up from
there and lived in the strongholds of En-gedi. </font>
