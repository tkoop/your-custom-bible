<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the fifteenth day of the second month
after they had left the land of Egypt, the whole congregation of
Israel set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is
between Elim and Sinai. And there in the desert they all grumbled
against Moses and Aaron. “If only we had died by the LORD’s hand
in the land of Egypt!” they said. “There we sat by pots of meat
and ate our fill of bread, but you have brought us into this desert
to starve this whole assembly to death!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I
will rain down bread from heaven for you. Each day the people are to
go out and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test
whether or not they will follow My instructions. Then on the sixth
day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much
as they gather on the other days.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses and Aaron said to all the
Israelites, “This evening you will know that it was the LORD who
brought you out of the land of Egypt, and in the morning you will see
the LORD’s glory, because He has heard your grumbling against Him.
For who are we that you should grumble against us?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Moses added, “The LORD will give you
meat to eat this evening and bread to fill you in the morning, for He
has heard your grumbling against Him. Who are we? Your grumblings are
not against us but against the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses said to Aaron, “Tell the
whole congregation of Israel, ‘Come before the LORD, for He has
heard your grumbling.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And as Aaron was speaking to the whole
congregation of Israel, they looked toward the desert, and there in a
cloud the glory of the LORD appeared. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “I have
heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, ‘At twilight you
will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then
you will know that I am the LORD your God.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That evening quail came and covered the
camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
When the layer of dew had evaporated, there were thin flakes on the
desert floor, as fine as frost on the ground. When the Israelites saw
it, they asked one another, “What is it?” For they did not know
what it was. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses told them, “It is the bread
that the LORD has given you to eat. This is what the LORD has
commanded: ‘Each one is to gather as much as he needs. You may take
an omer for each person in your tent.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the Israelites did this. Some gathered
more, and some less. When they measured it by the omer, he who
gathered much had no excess, and he who gathered little had no
shortfall. Each one gathered as much as he needed to eat. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Moses said to them, “No one may
keep any of it until morning.” But they did not listen to Moses;
some people left part of it until morning, and it became infested
with maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Every morning each one gathered as much as
was needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the sixth day, they gathered twice as
much food—two omers per person —and all the leaders of the
congregation came and reported this to Moses. He told them, “This
is what the LORD has said: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of complete
rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake, and
boil what you want to boil. Then set aside whatever remains and keep
it until morning.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they set it aside until morning as
Moses had commanded, and it did not smell or contain any maggots.
“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a Sabbath to the
LORD. Today you will not find anything in the field. For six days you
may gather, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, it will not be
there.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet on the seventh day some of the people
went out to gather, but they did not find anything. Then the LORD
said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep My commandments
and instructions? Understand that the LORD has given you the Sabbath;
that is why on the sixth day He will give you bread for two days. On
the seventh day, everyone must stay where he is; no one may leave his
place.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the people rested on the seventh day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the house of Israel called the bread
manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made
with honey. Moses said, “This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Keep
an omer of manna for the generations to come, so that they may see
the bread I fed you in the wilderness when I brought you out of the
land of Egypt.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses told Aaron, “Take a jar and
fill it with an omer of manna. Then place it before the LORD to be
preserved for the generations to come.” And Aaron placed it in
front of the Testimony, to be preserved just as the LORD had
commanded Moses. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Israelites ate manna forty years,
until they came to a land where they could settle; they ate manna
until they reached the border of Canaan. (Now an omer is a tenth of
an ephah.) </font>
