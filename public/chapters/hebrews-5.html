<font face="Tahoma, serif">Every high priest is appointed from among
men to represent them in matters relating to God, to offer gifts and
sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal gently with those who are
ignorant and misguided, since he himself is beset by weakness. That
is why he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well
as for the sins of the people. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">No one takes this honor upon himself; he
must be called by God, just as Aaron was. So also Christ did not take
upon Himself the glory of becoming a high priest, but He was called
by the One who said to Him: </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">During the days of Jesus’ earthly life,
He offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the
One who could save Him from death, and He was heard because of His
reverence. Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from what He
suffered. And having been made perfect, He became the source of
eternal salvation to all who obey Him and was designated by God as
high priest in the order of Melchizedek. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">We have much to say about this, but it is
hard to explain, because you are dull of hearing. Although by this
time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to reteach you the
basic principles of God’s word. You need milk, not solid food! </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">For everyone who lives on milk is still an
infant, inexperienced in the message of righteousness. But solid food
is for the mature, who by constant use have trained their senses to
distinguish good from evil. </font>
