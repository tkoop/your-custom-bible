<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene,
Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so they could go
and anoint the body of Jesus. Very early on the first day of the
week, just after sunrise, they went to the tomb. They were asking one
another, “Who will roll away the stone from the entrance of the
tomb?” But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been
rolled away, even though it was extremely large. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When they entered the tomb, they saw a
young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they
were alarmed. But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are
looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He
is not here! See the place where they put Him. But go, tell His
disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There
you will see Him, just as He told you.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the women left the tomb and ran away,
trembling and bewildered. And in their fear they did not say a word
to anyone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Early on the first day of the week, after
Jesus had risen, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He
had driven out seven demons. She went and told those who had been
with Him, who were mourning and weeping. And when they heard that
Jesus was alive and she had seen Him, they did not believe it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After this, Jesus appeared in a different
form to two of them as they walked along in the country. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And they went back and reported it to the
rest, but they did not believe them either. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Later, as they were eating, Jesus appeared
to the Eleven and rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of
heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He
had risen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And He said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Go
into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. Whoever
believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe
will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe:
In My name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new
tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink
any deadly poison, it will not harm them; they will lay their hands
on the sick, and they will be made well.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them,
He was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And they went out and preached everywhere,
and the Lord worked through them, confirming His word by the signs
that accompanied it. </font>
