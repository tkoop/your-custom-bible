<span class="reftext">2</span>Very early on the first day of the week,<span class="fn">a</span>  just after sunrise, they went to the tomb.
<span class="reftext">3</span>They were asking one another, “Who will roll away the stone from the entrance of the tomb?”
<span class="reftext">4</span>But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, even though it was extremely large.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here! See the place where they put Him.
<span class="reftext">7</span>But go, tell His disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him, just as He told you.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So the women left the tomb and ran away, trembling and bewildered. And in their fear they did not say a word to anyone.<span class="fn">b</span>
