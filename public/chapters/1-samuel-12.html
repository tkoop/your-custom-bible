<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Samuel’s Farewell Address</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to your voice in all that you have said to me, and I have set over you a king.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Now here is the king walking before you, and I am old and <span class='spell ca'>grey</span><span class='spell gb'>grey</span><span class='spell us'>gray</span>, and my sons are here with you. I have walked before you from my youth until this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Here I am. Bear witness against me before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and before <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> anointed: Whose ox or donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated or oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe and closed my eyes? Tell me, and I will restore it<span class="fn">a</span>  to you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“You have not wronged us or oppressed us,” they replied, “nor have you taken anything from the hand of man.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Samuel said to them, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> is a witness against you, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> anointed is a witness today, that you have not found anything in my hand.” </p><p class="reg1">“He is a witness,” they replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then Samuel said to the people, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> is the <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> who<span class="fn">b</span>  appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Now present yourselves, so that I may confront you before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> with all the righteous acts <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has done for you and your fathers.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When Jacob went to Egypt,<span class="fn">c</span>  your fathers cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> sent them Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
<span class="reftext">9</span>But they forgot <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> their God, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> sold them into the hand of Sisera the commander of the army of Hazor,<span class="fn">d</span>  and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then they cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and said, ‘We have sinned, for we have forsaken <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and served the Baals and Ashtoreths. Now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, that we may serve <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> sent Jerubbaal,<span class="fn">e</span>  Barak,<span class="fn">f</span>  Jephthah, and Samuel,<span class="fn">g</span>  and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> delivered you from the hands of your enemies on every side, and you dwelt securely.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, ‘No, we must have a king to rule over us’—even though <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God was your king.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you requested. Behold, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has placed a king over you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>If you fear <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and serve <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and obey <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> voice, and if you do not rebel against the command of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God, then all will be well.<span class="fn">h</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But if you disobey <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and rebel against <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> command, then the hand of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will be against you as it was against your fathers.<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Now, therefore, stand and see this great thing that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will do before your eyes.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call on <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to send thunder and rain, so that you will know and see what a great evil you have committed in the sight of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> by asking for a king.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>So Samuel called to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and on that day <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> sent thunder and rain. </p><p class="reg1"> As a result, all the people greatly feared <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and Samuel.
<span class="reftext">19</span>They pleaded with Samuel, “Pray to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God for your servants so that we will not die! For we have added to all our sins the evil of asking for a king.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>“Do not be afraid,” Samuel replied. “Even though you have committed all this evil, do not turn aside from following <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, but serve <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> with all your heart.
<span class="reftext">21</span>Do not turn aside after worthless things that cannot profit you or deliver you, for they are empty.
<span class="reftext">22</span>Indeed, for the sake of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> great name, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will not abandon <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> people, because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was pleased to make you <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> by ceasing to pray for you. And I will continue to teach you the good and right way.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Above all, fear <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and serve <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has done for you.
<span class="reftext">25</span>But if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will be swept away.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">And I will restore it</i>; LXX <i class="calibre6">Testify against me, and I will restore it</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew; LXX <i class="calibre6"><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> is the witness who</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew; LXX includes <i class="calibre6">and the Egyptians oppressed them</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> LXX <i class="calibre6">the army of Jabin king of Hazor</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">Jerubbaal</i> is another name for <i class="calibre6">Gideon</i> and probably means <i class="calibre6">let Baal contend</i>; see Judges 6:32.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> LXX and Syriac; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Bedan</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> LXX and Syriac <i class="calibre6">Samson</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> <i class="calibre6">then all will be well</i> is implied; Literally <i class="calibre6">If you fear <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and serve Him and obey His voice, and if you do not rebel against the command of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, (then) both you and the king who reigns over you will follow <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> Hebrew; LXX <i class="calibre6">against your king</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
