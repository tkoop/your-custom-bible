<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Rulers and Prophets Condemned</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then I said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Hear now, O leaders of Jacob, </p><p class="indent"> you rulers of the house of Israel. </p><p class="indent"> Should you not know justice?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>You hate good and love evil. </p><p class="indent"> You tear the skin from my people </p><p class="indent"> and strip the flesh from their bones.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>You eat the flesh of my people </p><p class="indent"> after stripping off their skin </p><p class="indent"> and breaking their bones. </p><p class="indent1"> You chop them up like flesh for the cooking pot, </p><p class="indent"> like meat in a cauldron.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then they will cry out to the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> but He will not answer them. </p><p class="indent1"> At that time He will hide His face from them </p><p class="indent"> because of the evil they have done.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>This is what the LORD says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“As for the prophets </p><p class="indent"> who lead My people astray, </p><p class="indent1"> who proclaim peace </p><p class="indent"> while they chew with their teeth, </p><p class="indent1"> but declare war against one </p><p class="indent"> who puts nothing in their mouths:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore night will come over you without visions, </p><p class="indent"> and darkness without divination. </p><p class="indent1"> The sun will set on these prophets, </p><p class="indent"> and the daylight will turn black over them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then the seers will be ashamed </p><p class="indent"> and the diviners will be disgraced. </p><p class="indent1"> They will all cover their mouths </p><p class="indent"> because there is no answer from God.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>As for me, however, I am filled with power </p><p class="indent"> by the Spirit of the LORD, </p><p class="indent1"> with justice and courage, </p><p class="indent"> to declare to Jacob his transgression </p><p class="indent"> and to Israel his sin.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Now hear this, O leaders of the house of Jacob </p><p class="indent"> and rulers of the house of Israel, </p><p class="indent1"> who despise justice </p><p class="indent"> and pervert all that is right,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>who build Zion with bloodshed </p><p class="indent"> and Jerusalem with iniquity.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Her leaders judge for a bribe, </p><p class="indent"> her priests teach for a price, </p><p class="indent"> and her prophets practice divination for money. </p><p class="indent1"> Yet they lean upon the LORD, saying, </p><p class="indent">“Is not the LORD among us? </p><p class="indent"> No disaster can come upon us.”
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore, because of you, </p><p class="indent"> Zion will be plowed like a field, </p><p class="indent1"> Jerusalem will become a heap of rubble, </p><p class="indent"> and the temple mount a wooded ridge.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
