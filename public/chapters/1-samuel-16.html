<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Samuel Anoints David</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Samuel, “How long are you going to mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem, for I have selected from his sons a king for <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“How can I go?” Samuel asked. “Saul will hear of it and kill me!” </p><p class="reg1"> <span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> answered, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.’
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you are to do. You are to anoint for <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> the one I indicate.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>So Samuel did what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had said and went to Bethlehem. When the elders of the town met him, they trembled and asked, “Do you come in peace?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>“In peace,” he replied. “I have come to sacrifice to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” </p><p class="reg1"> Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
<span class="reftext">6</span>When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and said, “Surely here before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> anointed.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or height, for I have rejected him; <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> does not see as man does. For man sees the outward appearance, but <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> sees the heart.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel, who said, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> has not chosen this one either.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Next Jesse presented Shammah,<span class="fn">a</span>  but Samuel said, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> has not chosen this one either.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel told him, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> has not chosen any of these.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And Samuel asked him, “Are these all the sons you have?” </p><p class="reg1">“There is still the youngest,” Jesse replied, “but he is tending the sheep.” </p><p class="reg1">“Send for him,” Samuel replied. “For we will not sit down to eat until he arrives.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So Jesse sent for his youngest son and brought him in. He was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said, “Rise and anoint him, for he is the one.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> rushed upon David from that day forward. Then Samuel set out and went to Ramah.
</p><p class="hdg">David Serves Saul</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>After the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had departed from Saul, a spirit of distress<span class="fn">b</span>  from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> began to torment him.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Saul’s servants said to him, “Surely a spirit of distress from God is tormenting you.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Let our lord command your servants here to seek out someone who can skillfully play the harp. Whenever the spirit of distress from God is upon you, he is to play it, and you will be well.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>And Saul commanded his servants, “Find me someone who plays well, and bring him to me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>One of the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the harp. He is a mighty man of <span class='spell ca'>valour</span><span class='spell gb'>valour</span><span class='spell us'>valor</span>, a warrior, eloquent and handsome, and <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is with him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and one young goat, and sent them to Saul with his son David.
<span class="reftext">21</span>When David came to Saul and entered his service, Saul admired him greatly, and David became his <span class='spell ca'>armour</span><span class='spell gb'>armour</span><span class='spell us'>armor</span>-bearer.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Let David remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.”
<span class="reftext">23</span>And whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would pick up his harp and play, and Saul would become well, and the spirit of distress would depart from him.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Shammah</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Shimeah</i>, <i class="calibre6">Shimea</i>, and <i class="calibre6">Shimei</i>; see 2 Samuel 13:3, 1 Chronicles 2:13, and 2 Samuel 21:21.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">a harmful spirit</i>; similarly in verses 15, 16, and 23<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
