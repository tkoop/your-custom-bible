<font ><b>Samuel Anoints David</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the LORD said to Samuel, “How long
are you going to mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king
over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I am sending you to
Jesse of Bethlehem, for I have selected from his sons a king for
Myself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >How can I go?” Samuel asked. “Saul
will hear of it and kill me!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD answered, “Take a heifer with
you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’ Then invite
Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you are to do. You
are to anoint for Me the one I indicate.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Samuel did what the LORD had said and
went to Bethlehem. When the elders of the town met him, they trembled
and asked, “Do you come in peace?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >In peace,” he replied. “I have come
to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to
the sacrifice.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and
invited them to the sacrifice. When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab
and said, “Surely here before the LORD is His anointed.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not
consider his appearance or height, for I have rejected him; the LORD
does not see as man does. For man sees the outward appearance, but
the LORD sees the heart.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented
him to Samuel, who said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next Jesse presented Shammah, but Samuel
said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus Jesse made seven of his sons pass
before Samuel, but Samuel told him, “The LORD has not chosen any of
these.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Samuel asked him, “Are these all the
sons you have?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >There is still the youngest,” Jesse
replied, “but he is tending the sheep.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Send for him,” Samuel replied. “For
we will not sit down to eat until he arrives.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jesse sent for his youngest son and
brought him in. He was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome
appearance. And the LORD said, “Rise and anoint him, for he is the
one.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Samuel took the horn of oil and
anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and the Spirit of the
LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. Then Samuel set out and
went to Ramah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After the Spirit of the LORD had departed
from Saul, a spirit of distress from the LORD began to torment him.
Saul’s servants said to him, “Surely a spirit of distress from
God is tormenting you. Let our lord command your servants here to
seek out someone who can skillfully play the harp. Whenever the
spirit of distress from God is upon you, he is to play it, and you
will be well.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Saul commanded his servants, “Find
me someone who plays well, and bring him to me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One of the servants answered, “I have
seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the harp. He
is a mighty man of valor, a warrior, eloquent and handsome, and the
LORD is with him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said,
“Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread,
a skin of wine, and one young goat, and sent them to Saul with his
son David. When David came to Saul and entered his service, Saul
admired him greatly, and David became his armor-bearer. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Let
David remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.” And
whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would pick up his
harp and play, and Saul would become well, and the spirit of distress
would depart from him. </font>
