<font >Once again, Jesus spoke to them in
parables: <font color="#a80000">“The kingdom of heaven is like a
king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. He sent his servants
to call those he had invited to the banquet, but they refused to
come.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Again, he sent other
servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have
prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been killed, and
everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But they paid no
attention and went away, one to his field, another to his business.
The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The king was
enraged, and he sent his troops to destroy those murderers and burn
their city. Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is
ready, but those I invited were not worthy. Go therefore to the
crossroads and invite to the banquet as many as you can find.’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >So the servants went
out into the streets and gathered everyone they could find, both evil
and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But when the king
came in to see the guests, he spotted a man who was not dressed in
wedding clothes. ‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how did you get in here
without wedding clothes?’ </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >But the man was
speechless. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >Then the king told
the servants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer
darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then the Pharisees went out and conspired
to trap Jesus in His words. They sent their disciples to Him along
with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that You are
honest and that You teach the way of God in accordance with the
truth. You seek favor from no one, because You pay no attention to
external appearance. So tell us what You think: Is it lawful to pay
taxes to Caesar or not?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But Jesus knew their evil intent and said,
<font color="#a80000">“You hypocrites, why are you testing Me? Show
Me the coin used for the tax.”</font> </font>

<font >So Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“Give
to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And when they heard this, they were
amazed. So they left Him and went away. </font>

<font >That same day the Sadducees, who say there
is no resurrection, came to Jesus and questioned Him. “Teacher,”
they said, “Moses declared that if a man dies without having
children, his brother is to marry the widow and raise up offspring
for him. Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one
married and died without having children. So he left his wife to his
brother. The same thing happened to the second and third brothers,
down to the seventh. And last of all, the woman died. In the
resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For all of
them were married to her.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“You
are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of
God. In the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in
marriage. Instead, they will be like the angels in heaven. But
concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God
said to you: ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</font>

<font >And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus
had silenced the Sadducees, they themselves gathered together. One of
them, an expert in the law, tested Him with a question: “Teacher,
which commandment is the greatest in the Law?” </font>

the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with

second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law
and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”</font> </font>
