<span><span class="reftext">2</span>“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
<span class="reftext">3</span>He sent his servants to call those he had invited to the banquet, but they refused to come.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">4</span>Again, he sent other servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">5</span>But they paid no attention and went away, one to his field, another to his business.
<span class="reftext">6</span>The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">7</span>The king was enraged, and he sent his troops to destroy those murderers and burn their city.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited were not worthy.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Go therefore to the crossroads and invite to the banquet as many as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> can find.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">10</span>So the servants went out into the streets and gathered everyone they could find, both evil and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">11</span>But when the king came in to see the guests, he spotted a man who was not dressed in wedding clothes.
<span class="reftext">12</span>‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ </p><p class="calibre3"> But the man was speechless.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then the king told the servants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">14</span>For many are called, but few are chosen.”
</p><p class="hdg">Paying Taxes to Caesar<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 12:13–17; Luke 20:19–26)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then the Pharisees went out and conspired to trap Jesus in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> words.
<span class="reftext">16</span>They sent their disciples to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> are honest and that <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You seek <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> from no one, because <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> pay no attention to external appearance.
<span class="reftext">17</span>So tell us what <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> think: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>But Jesus knew their evil intent and said, <span>“<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> hypocrites, why are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> testing <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>?
<span class="reftext">19</span>Show <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> the coin used for the tax.”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> And they brought <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> a denarius.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">20</span>“Whose image is this,”</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> asked, <span>“and whose inscription?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>“Caesar’s,” they answered. </p><p class="reg1"> So Jesus told them, <span>“Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And when they heard this, they were amazed. So they left <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and went away.
</p><p class="hdg">The Sadducees and the Resurrection<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 12:18–27; Luke 20:27–40)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and questioned <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">24</span>“Teacher,” they said, “Moses declared that if a man dies without having children, his brother is to marry the widow and raise up offspring for him.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died without having children. So he left his wife to his brother.
<span class="reftext">26</span>The same thing happened to the second and third brothers, down to the seventh.
<span class="reftext">27</span>And last of all, the woman died.
<span class="reftext">28</span>In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For all of them were married to her.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>Jesus answered, <span>“<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are mistaken because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not know the <span class='cap'>Scriptures</span><span class='nocap'>scriptures</span> or the power of God.
<span class="reftext">30</span>In the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage. Instead, they will be like the angels<span class="fn">c</span>  in heaven.
<span class="reftext">31</span>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not read what God said to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>:
<span class="reftext">32</span>‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’<span class="fn">d</span>? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> teaching.
</p><p class="hdg">The Greatest Commandment<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 6:1–19; Mark 12:28–34)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they themselves gathered together.
<span class="reftext">35</span>One of them, an expert in the law, tested <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> with a question:
<span class="reftext">36</span>“Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>Jesus declared, <span>“<span class="thinq"> </span>‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">38</span>This is the first and greatest commandment.
<span class="reftext">39</span>And the second is like it: ‘Love your <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span> as yourself.’<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">40</span>All the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> and the <span class='cap'>Prophets</span><span class='nocap'>prophets</span> hang on these two commandments.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Whose Son Is the Christ?<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 12:35–37; Luke 20:41–44)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus questioned them:
<span class="reftext">42</span><span>“What do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> think about the Christ? Whose son is <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span>?”</span> </p><p class="reg1">“David’s,” they answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“How then does David in the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> call <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> ‘Lord’? For he says:</span>
</p><p class="indent1stlinered"><span class="reftext">44</span>‘The Lord said to my Lord, </p><p class="indentred">“Sit at <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> right hand </p><p class="indentred1"> until I put <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> enemies </p><p class="indentred"> under <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> feet.”<span class="thinq"> </span>’<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">45</span>So if David calls <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> ‘Lord,’ how can <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> be David’s son?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>No one was able to answer a word, and from that day on no one dared to question <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> any further.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> A denarius was customarily a day’s wage for a <span class='spell ca'>labourer</span><span class='spell gb'>labourer</span><span class='spell us'>laborer</span>; see Matthew 20:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Deuteronomy 25:5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">30</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> SBL, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">the angels of God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">32</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Exodus 3:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">37</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Deuteronomy 6:5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">39</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Leviticus 19:18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">44</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Psalm 110:1<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
