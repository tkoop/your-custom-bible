</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Judah mourns </p><p class="indent"> and her gates languish. </p><p class="indent1"> Her people wail for the land, </p><p class="indent"> and a cry goes up from Jerusalem.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>The nobles send their servants for water; </p><p class="indent"> they go to the cisterns, but find no water; </p><p class="indent"> their jars return empty. </p><p class="indent1"> They are ashamed and humiliated; </p><p class="indent"> they cover their heads.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>The ground is cracked </p><p class="indent"> because no rain has fallen on the land. </p><p class="indent1"> The farmers are ashamed; </p><p class="indent"> they cover their heads.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>O Hope of Israel, </p><p class="indent"> its <span class='cap'>Savior</span><span class='nocap'>savior</span> in times of distress, </p><p class="indent1"> why are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> like a stranger in the land, </p><p class="indent"> like a <span class='spell ca'>traveller</span><span class='spell gb'>traveller</span><span class='spell us'>traveler</span> who stays but a night?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Why are <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> like a man taken by surprise, </p><p class="indent"> like a warrior powerless to save? </p><p class="indent1"> Yet <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> are among us, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, </p><p class="indent"> and we are called by <span class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> name. </p><p class="indent1stline"> Do not forsake us!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says about this people: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Truly they love to wander; </p><p class="indent"> they have not restrained their feet. </p><p class="indent1"> So <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> does not accept them; </p><p class="indent"> He will now remember their guilt </p><p class="indent"> and call their sins to account.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me, “Do not pray for the well-being of this people.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Although they may fast, I will not listen to their cry; although they may offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will finish them off by sword and famine and plague.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>“Ah, Lord GOD!” I replied, “Look, the prophets are telling them, ‘You will not see the sword or suffer famine, but I will give you lasting peace in this place.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>“The prophets are prophesying lies in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name,” replied <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. “I did not send them or appoint them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a false vision, a worthless divination, the futility and delusion of their own minds.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Therefore this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says about the prophets who prophesy in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name: I did not send them, yet they say, ‘No sword or famine will touch this land.’ </p><p class="reg1"> By sword and famine these very prophets will meet their end!
<span class="reftext">16</span>And the people to whom they prophesy will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem because of famine and sword. There will be no one to bury them or their wives, their sons or their daughters. I will pour out their own evil upon them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>You are to speak this word to them: </p><p class="indent1stline">‘My eyes overflow with tears; </p><p class="indent"> day and night they do not cease, </p><p class="indent1"> for the virgin daughter of my people </p><p class="indent"> has been shattered by a crushing blow, </p><p class="indent"> a severely grievous wound.
