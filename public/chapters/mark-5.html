<font ><b>The Healing Touch of Jesus</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the other side of the sea, they arrived
in the region of the Gerasenes. As soon as Jesus got out of the boat,
He was met by a man with an unclean spirit, who was coming from the
tombs. This man had been living in the tombs and could no longer be
restrained, even with chains. Though he was often bound with chains
and shackles, he had broken the chains and shattered the shackles.
Now there was no one with the strength to subdue him. Night and day
in the tombs and in the mountains he kept crying out and cutting
himself with stones. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the man saw Jesus from a distance, he
ran and fell on his knees before Him. And he shouted in a loud voice,
“What do You want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg
You before God not to torture me!” For Jesus had already declared,
<font color="#a80000">“Come out of this man, you unclean spirit!”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >What is your
name?”</font> Jesus asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >My name is Legion,” he replied, “for
we are many.” And he begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out
of that region. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There on the nearby hillside a large herd
of pigs was feeding. So the demons begged Jesus, “Send us to the
pigs, so that we may enter them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He gave them permission, and the unclean
spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two
thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the
water. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Those tending the pigs ran off and
reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to
see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who
had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there, clothed and
in his right mind; and they were afraid. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Those who had seen it described what had
happened to the demon-possessed man and also to the pigs. And the
people began to beg Jesus to leave their region. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As He was getting into the boat, the man
who had been possessed by the demons begged to go with Him. But Jesus
would not allow him. <font color="#a80000">“Go home to your own
people,”</font> He said, <font color="#a80000">“and tell them how
much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy He has shown you.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the man went away and began to proclaim
throughout the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And
everyone was amazed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus had again crossed by boat to
the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him beside the sea. A
synagogue leader named Jairus arrived, and seeing Jesus, he fell at
His feet and pleaded with Him urgently, “My little daughter is near
death. Please come and place Your hands on her, so that she will be
healed and live.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd
followed and pressed around Him. And a woman was there who had
suffered from bleeding for twelve years. She had borne much agony
under the care of many physicians and had spent all she had, but to
no avail. Instead, her condition had only grown worse. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the woman heard about Jesus, she came
up through the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak. For she kept
saying, “If only I touch His garments, I will be healed.”
Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she sensed in her body that she
was healed of her affliction. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At once Jesus was aware that power had
gone out from Him. Turning to the crowd, He asked, <font color="#a80000">“Who
touched My garments?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >His disciples answered, “You can see the
crowd pressing in on You, and yet You ask, <font color="#a80000">‘Who
touched Me?’</font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But He kept looking around to see who had
done this. Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and
fell down before Him trembling in fear, and she told Him the whole
truth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Daughter,”</font>
said Jesus, <font color="#a80000">“your faith has healed you. Go in
peace and be free of your affliction.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While He was still speaking, messengers
from the house of Jairus arrived and said, “Your daughter is dead;
why bother the Teacher anymore?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Jesus overheard their conversation and
said to Jairus, <font color="#a80000">“Do not be afraid; just
believe.”</font> And He did not allow anyone to accompany Him
except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they arrived at the house of the
synagogue leader, Jesus saw the commotion and the people weeping and
wailing loudly. He went inside and asked, <font color="#a80000">“Why
all this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but asleep.”</font>
And they laughed at Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After He had put them all outside, He took
the child’s father and mother and His own companions, and went in
to see the child. Taking her by the hand, Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“Talitha
koum!”</font> which means, <font color="#a80000">“Little girl, I
say to you, get up!”</font> Immediately the girl got up and began
to walk around. She was twelve years old, and at once they were
utterly astounded. Then Jesus gave strict orders that no one should
know about this, and He told them to give her something to eat. </font>
