<span class="reftext">2</span>As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was met by a man with an unclean spirit, who was coming from the tombs.
<span class="reftext">3</span>This man had been living in the tombs and could no longer be restrained, even with chains.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Though he was often bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and shattered the shackles. Now there was no one with the strength to subdue him.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Night and day in the tombs and in the mountains he kept crying out and cutting himself with stones.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>When the man saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees before <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And he shouted in a loud voice, “What do <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> want with me, Jesus, Son of the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span> <span class='cap'>High</span><span class='nocap'>high</span> God? I beg <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> before God not to torture me!”
<span class="reftext">8</span>For Jesus had already declared, <span>“Come out of this man, you unclean spirit!”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">9</span>“What is your name?”</span> Jesus asked. </p><p class="reg1">“My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.”
<span class="reftext">10</span>And he begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of that region.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>There on the nearby hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding.
<span class="reftext">12</span>So the demons begged Jesus, “Send us to the pigs, so that we may enter them.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>He gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs, and the herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the water.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.
<span class="reftext">15</span>When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Those who had seen it described what had happened to the demon-possessed man and also to the pigs.
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the people began to beg Jesus to leave their region.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>As <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed by the demons begged to go with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But Jesus would not allow him. <span>“Go home to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> own people,”</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said, <span>“and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and what mercy <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has shown you.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>So the man went away and began to proclaim throughout the Decapolis<span class="fn">c</span>  how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed.
</p><p class="hdg">The Healing Touch of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 9:18–26; Luke 8:40–56)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>When Jesus had again crossed by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> beside the sea.
<span class="reftext">22</span>A synagogue leader named Jairus arrived, and seeing Jesus, he fell at <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> feet
<span class="reftext">23</span>and pleaded with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Please come and place <span class='youpl' data-word='Your'>Your</span>n class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> hands on her, so that she will be healed and live.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">25</span>And a woman was there who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years.
<span class="reftext">26</span>She had borne much agony under the care of many physicians and had spent all she had, but to no avail. Instead, her condition had only grown worse.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>When the woman heard about Jesus, she came up through the crowd behind <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and touched <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> cloak.
<span class="reftext">28</span>For she kept saying, “If only I touch <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> garments, I will be healed.”
<span class="reftext">29</span>Immediately her bleeding stopped, and she sensed in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>At once Jesus was aware that power had gone out from <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. Turning to the crowd, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> asked, <span>“Who touched <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> garments?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>His disciples answered, “You can see the crowd pressing in on <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span>, and yet <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> ask, <span>‘Who touched <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>?’</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>But <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> kept looking around to see who had done this.
<span class="reftext">33</span>Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> trembling in fear, and she told <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> the whole truth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">34</span>“Daughter,”</span> said Jesus, <span>“your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free of your affliction.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>While <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was still speaking, messengers from the house of Jairus arrived and said, “Your daughter is dead; why bother the <span class='cap'>Teacher</span><span class='nocap'>teacher</span> anymore?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>But Jesus overheard<span class="fn">d</span>  their conversation and said to Jairus, <span>“Do not be afraid; just believe.”</span>
<span class="reftext">37</span>And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> did not allow anyone to accompany <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>When they arrived at the house of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw the commotion and the people weeping and wailing loudly.
<span class="reftext">39</span>He went inside and asked, <span>“Why all this commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but asleep.”</span>
<span class="reftext">40</span>And they laughed at <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>. </p><p class="reg1"> After <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> had put them all outside, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> took the child’s father and mother and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own companions, and went in to see the child.
<span class="reftext">41</span>Taking her by the hand, Jesus said, <span>“Talitha koum!”</span> which means, <span>“Little girl, I say to you, get up!”</span>
<span class="reftext">42</span>Immediately the girl got up and began to walk around. She was twelve years old, and at once they were utterly astounded.
<span class="reftext">43</span>Then Jesus gave strict orders that no one should know about this, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> told them to give her something to eat.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">Gadarenes</i>; GOC <i class="calibre6">Gergesenes</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">and were drowned in the sea</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> That is, the Ten Cities<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">36</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">ignored</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
