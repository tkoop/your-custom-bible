<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Call to Maturity</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works,<span class="fn">a</span>  and of faith in God,
<span class="reftext">2</span>instruction about baptisms,<span class="fn">b</span>  the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span>.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And this we will do, if God permits.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>,
<span class="reftext">5</span>who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age—
<span class="reftext">6</span>and then have fallen away—to be restored to repentance, because they themselves are crucifying the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of God all over again and subjecting <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> to open shame.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>For land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is tended receives the blessing of God.
<span class="reftext">8</span>But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless, and its curse is imminent. In the end it will be burned.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Even though we speak like this, beloved, we are convinced of better things in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> case—things that accompany salvation.
<span class="reftext">10</span>For God is not unjust. He will not forget <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> work and the love <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have shown for <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> name as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have ministered to the saints and continue to do so.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>We want each of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will not be sluggish, but will imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Unchangeable Promise</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>When God made <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> promise to Abraham, since <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> had no one greater to swear by, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> swore by <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span><span class='bsb'>Himself</span>,
<span class="reftext">14</span>saying, “I will surely bless you and multiply your descendants.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And so Abraham, after waiting patiently, obtained the promise.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Men swear by someone greater than themselves, and their oath serves as a confirmation to end all argument.
<span class="reftext">17</span>So when God wanted to make the unchanging nature of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> purpose very clear to the heirs of the promise, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> guaranteed it with an oath.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Thus by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be strongly encouraged.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,
<span class="reftext">20</span>where Jesus our forerunner has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">from acts that lead to death</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">cleansing rites</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Genesis 22:17<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
