<font ><b>The Triumph of Faith</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, since we have been justified
through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which
we stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Not only that, but we also rejoice in our
sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;
perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not
disappoint us, because God has poured out His love into our hearts
through the Holy Spirit, whom He has given us. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For at just the right time, while we were
still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. Very rarely will anyone
die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly
dare to die. But God proves His love for us in this: While we were
still sinners, Christ died for us. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, since we have now been
justified by His blood, how much more shall we be saved from wrath
through Him! For if, when we were enemies of God, we were reconciled
to Him through the death of His Son, how much more, having been
reconciled, shall we be saved through His life! Not only that, but we
also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we
have now received reconciliation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore, just as sin entered the world
through one man, and death through sin, so also death was passed on
to all men, because all sinned. For sin was in the world before the
law was given; but sin is not taken into account when there is no
law. Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over
those who did not sin in the way that Adam transgressed. He is a
pattern of the One to come. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the gift is not like the trespass. For
if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did
God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man,
Jesus Christ, abound to the many! Again, the gift is not like the
result of the one man’s sin: The judgment that followed one sin
brought condemnation, but the gift that followed many trespasses
brought justification. For if, by the trespass of the one man, death
reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive an
abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life
through the one man, Jesus Christ! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So then, just as one trespass brought
condemnation for all men, so also one act of righteousness brought
justification and life for all men. For just as through the
disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also
through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The law came in so that the trespass would
increase; but where sin increased, grace increased all the more, so
that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through
righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. </font>
