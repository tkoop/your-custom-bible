<font ><b>The Offering of Isaac</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some time later God tested Abraham and
said to him, “Abraham!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Here I am,” he answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Take your son,” God said, “your
only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer
him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will
show you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Abraham got up early the next morning,
saddled his donkey, and took along two of his servants and his son
Isaac. He split the wood for a burnt offering and set out for the
place God had designated. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the third day Abraham looked up and saw
the place in the distance. “Stay here with the donkey,” Abraham
told his servants. “The boy and I will go over there to worship,
and then we will return to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Abraham took the wood for the burnt
offering and placed it on his son Isaac. He himself carried the fire
and the sacrificial knife, and the two of them walked on together. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My
father!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Here I am, my son,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >The fire and the wood are here,” said
Isaac, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Abraham answered, “God Himself will
provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two
walked on together. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they arrived at the place God had
designated, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood. He
bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar, atop the wood. Then
Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Just then the angel of the LORD called out
to him from heaven, “Abraham, Abraham!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Here I am,” he replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Do not lay a hand on the boy or do
anything to him,” said the angel, “for now I know that you fear
God, since you have not withheld your only son from me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Abraham looked up and saw behind him
a ram in a thicket, caught by its horns. So he went and took the ram
and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. And Abraham
called that place The LORD Will Provide. So to this day it is said,
“On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the angel of the LORD called to
Abraham from heaven a second time, saying, “By Myself I have sworn,
declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not
withheld your only son, I will surely bless you, and I will multiply
your descendants like the stars in the sky and the sand on the
seashore. Your descendants will possess the gates of their enemies.
And through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed,
because you have obeyed My voice.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Abraham went back to his servants, and
they got up and set out together for Beersheba. And Abraham settled
in Beersheba. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some time later, Abraham was told, “Milcah
has also borne sons to your brother Nahor: Uz the firstborn, his
brother Buz, Kemuel (the father of Aram), Chesed, Hazo, Pildash,
Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.
Milcah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor. Moreover,
Nahor’s concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham,
Tahash, and Maacah. </font>
