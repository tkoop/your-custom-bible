<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Offering of Isaac<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(John 3:1–21)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Some time later God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” </p><p class="reg1">“Here I am,” he answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Take your son,” God said, “your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will show you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So Abraham got up early the next morning, saddled his donkey, and took along two of his servants and his son Isaac. He split the wood for a burnt offering and set out for the place God had designated.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
<span class="reftext">5</span>“Stay here with the donkey,” Abraham told his servants. “The boy and I will go over there to worship, and then we will return to you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac. He himself carried the fire and the sacrificial knife, and the two of them walked on together.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” </p><p class="reg1">“Here I am, my son,” he replied. </p><p class="reg1">“The fire and the wood are here,” said Isaac, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Abraham answered, “God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two walked on together.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>When they arrived at the place God had designated, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood. He bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar, atop the wood.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son.
</p><p class="hdg">The LORD Provides the Sacrifice</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Just then the angel<span class="fn">a</span>  of the LORD called out to him from heaven, “Abraham, Abraham!” </p><p class="reg1">“Here I am,” he replied.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him,” said the angel, “for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your only son from me.<span class="fn">b</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then Abraham looked up and saw behind him a ram<span class="fn">c</span>  in a thicket, caught by its horns. So he went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide.<span class="fn">d</span>  So to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time,
<span class="reftext">16</span>saying, “By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your only son,
<span class="reftext">17</span>I will surely bless you, and I will multiply your descendants<span class="fn">e</span>  like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will possess the gates of their enemies.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed,<span class="fn">f</span>  because you have obeyed My voice.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Abraham went back to his servants, and they got up and set out together for Beersheba. And Abraham settled in Beersheba.
</p><p class="hdg">The Sons of Nahor</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Some time later, Abraham was told, “Milcah has also borne sons to your brother Nahor:
<span class="reftext">21</span>Uz the firstborn, his brother Buz, Kemuel (the father of Aram),
<span class="reftext">22</span>Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>And Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor.
<span class="reftext">24</span>Moreover, Nahor’s concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Angel</i>; also in verses 12 and 15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">from Me</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Most MT manuscripts; other Hebrew manuscripts, SP, LXX, and Syriac <i class="calibre6">saw one ram</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">YHWH Yireh</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Cited in Hebrews 6:14<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Cited in Acts 3:25<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
