</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>So the <span class='cap'>Twelve</span><span class='nocap'>twelve</span><span class='bsb'>Twelve</span> summoned all the disciples and said, “It is unacceptable for us to neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore, brothers, select from among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> seven men confirmed to be full of the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> and wisdom. We will appoint this responsibility to them
<span class="reftext">4</span>and will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span>, as well as Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">6</span>They presented these seven to the apostles,<span class="fn">c</span>  who prayed and laid their hands on them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>So the word of God continued to spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem grew rapidly, and a great number of priests became obedient to the faith.
</p><p class="hdg">The Arrest of Stephen</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Now Stephen, who was full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.
<span class="reftext">9</span>But resistance arose from what was called the Synagogue of the <span class='cap'>Freedmen</span><span class='nocap'>freedmen</span><span class='bsb'>Freedmen</span>, including Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and men from the provinces of Cilicia and Asia.<span class="fn">d</span>  They began to argue with Stephen,
<span class="reftext">10</span>but they could not stand up to his wisdom or the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> by whom he spoke.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then they prompted some men to say, “We heard Stephen speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So they stirred up the people, elders, and scribes and confronted Stephen. They seized him and brought him before the Sanhedrin,<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">13</span>where they presented false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law.
<span class="reftext">14</span>For we have heard him say that Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the Hellenists began to grumble against the Hebrews</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">and Nicolas, a convert of Antioch,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">—whom they set before the apostles,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">and those from Cilicia and Asia</i>; the Roman Province of Asia was located in what is now western Turkey.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Council</i>; also in verse 15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
