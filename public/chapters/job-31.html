<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Job’s Final Appeal</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>“I have made a covenant with my eyes. </p><p class="indent"> How then could I gaze with desire at a virgin?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>For what is the allotment of God from above, </p><p class="indent"> or the heritage from the Almighty on high?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Does not disaster come to the unjust </p><p class="indent"> and calamity to the workers of iniquity?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Does He not see my ways </p><p class="indent"> and count my every step?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>If I have walked in falsehood </p><p class="indent"> or my foot has rushed to deceit,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>let God weigh me with honest scales, </p><p class="indent"> that He may know my integrity.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>If my steps have turned from the path, </p><p class="indent"> if my heart has followed my eyes, </p><p class="indent"> or if impurity has stuck to my hands,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>then may another eat what I have sown, </p><p class="indent"> and may my crops be uprooted.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>If my heart has been enticed by my <span class='spell ca'>neighbour</span><span class='spell gb'>neighbour</span><span class='spell us'>neighbor</span>’s wife, </p><p class="indent"> or I have lurked at his door,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>then may my own wife grind grain for another, </p><p class="indent"> and may other men sleep with her.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>For that would be a heinous crime, </p><p class="indent"> an iniquity to be judged.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>For it is a fire that burns down to Abaddon;<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> it would root out my entire harvest.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or maidservant </p><p class="indent"> when they made a complaint against me,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>what will I do when God rises to judge? </p><p class="indent"> How will I answer when called to account?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Did not He who made me in the womb also make them? </p><p class="indent"> Did not the same One form us in the womb?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>If I have denied the desires of the poor </p><p class="indent"> or allowed the widow’s eyes to fail,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>if I have eaten my morsel alone, </p><p class="indent"> not sharing it with the fatherless—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>though from my youth I reared him as would a father, </p><p class="indent"> and from my mother’s womb I guided the widow—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>if I have seen one perish for lack of clothing, </p><p class="indent"> or a needy man without a cloak,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>if his heart has not blessed me<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> for warming him with the fleece of my sheep,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless </p><p class="indent"> because I saw that I had support in the gate,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>then may my arm fall from my shoulder </p><p class="indent"> and be torn from its socket.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>For calamity from God terrifies me, </p><p class="indent"> and His <span class='spell ca'>splendour</span><span class='spell gb'>splendour</span><span class='spell us'>splendor</span> I cannot overpower.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>If I have put my trust in gold </p><p class="indent"> or called pure gold my security,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>if I have rejoiced in my great wealth </p><p class="indent"> because my hand had gained so much,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>if I have beheld the sun<span class="fn">c</span>  in its radiance </p><p class="indent"> or the moon moving in <span class='spell ca'>splendour</span><span class='spell gb'>splendour</span><span class='spell us'>splendor</span>,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>so that my heart was secretly enticed </p><p class="indent"> and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>this would also be an iniquity to be judged, </p><p class="indent"> for I would have denied God on high.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">29</span>If I have rejoiced in my enemy’s ruin, </p><p class="indent"> or exulted when evil befell him—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>I have not allowed my mouth to sin </p><p class="indent"> by asking for his life with a curse—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>if the men of my house have not said, </p><p class="indent">‘Who is there who has not had his fill?’—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>but no stranger had to lodge on the street, </p><p class="indent"> for my door has been open to the <span class='spell ca'>traveller</span><span class='spell gb'>traveller</span><span class='spell us'>traveler</span>—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>if I have covered my transgressions like Adam<span class="fn">d</span>  </p><p class="indent"> by hiding my guilt in my heart,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">34</span>because I greatly feared the crowds </p><p class="indent"> and the contempt of the clans terrified me, </p><p class="indent1"> so that I kept silent </p><p class="indent"> and would not go outside—
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">35</span>(Oh, that I had one to hear me! </p><p class="indent"> Here is my signature. </p><p class="indent1"> Let the Almighty answer me; </p><p class="indent"> let my accuser compose an indictment.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Surely I would carry it on my shoulder </p><p class="indent"> and wear it like a crown.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">37</span>I would give account of all my steps; </p><p class="indent"> I would approach Him like a prince.)—
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">38</span>if my land cries out against me </p><p class="indent"> and its furrows weep together,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">39</span>if I have devoured its produce without payment </p><p class="indent"> or broken the spirit of its tenants,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">40</span>then let briers grow instead of wheat </p><p class="indent"> and stinkweed instead of barley.” </p><p class="reg1"> Thus conclude the words of Job.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> <i class="calibre6">Abaddon</i> means <i class="calibre6">Destruction</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">if his loins have not blessed me</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the light</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">like men</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
