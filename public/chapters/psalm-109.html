<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Song of the Slandered</p><p class="pshdg"><span class="reftext"></span>For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. </p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>O God of my praise, </p><p class="indent"> be not silent.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me; </p><p class="indent"> they speak against me with lying tongues.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>They surround me with hateful words </p><p class="indent"> and attack me without cause.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>In return for my love they accuse me, </p><p class="indent"> but I am a man of prayer.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>They repay me evil for good, </p><p class="indent"> and hatred for my love.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Set over him a wicked man; </p><p class="indent"> let an accuser stand at his right hand.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>When he is tried, let him be found guilty, </p><p class="indent"> and may his prayer be regarded as sin.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>May his days be few; </p><p class="indent"> may another take his position.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>May his children be fatherless </p><p class="indent"> and his wife a widow.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>May his children wander as beggars, </p><p class="indent"> seeking sustenance<span class="fn">b</span>  far from their ruined homes.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>May the creditor seize all he owns, </p><p class="indent"> and strangers plunder the fruits of his labor.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>May there be no one to extend kindness to him, </p><p class="indent"> and no one to favor his fatherless children.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>May his descendants be cut off; </p><p class="indent"> may their name be blotted out from the next generation.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> and the sin of his mother never be blotted out.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>May their sins always remain before the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> that He may cut off their memory from the earth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>For he never thought to show kindness, </p><p class="indent"> but pursued the poor and needy and brokenhearted, </p><p class="indent"> even to their death.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>The cursing that he loved, </p><p class="indent"> may it fall on him; </p><p class="indent1"> the blessing in which he refused to delight, </p><p class="indent"> may it be far from him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>The cursing that he wore like a coat, </p><p class="indent"> may it soak into his body like water, </p><p class="indent"> and into his bones like oil.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>May it be like a robe wrapped about him, </p><p class="indent"> like a belt tied forever around him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>May this be the LORD’s reward to my accusers, </p><p class="indent"> to those who speak evil against me.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>But You, O GOD, the Lord, </p><p class="indent"> deal kindly with me for the sake of Your name; </p><p class="indent"> deliver me by the goodness of Your loving devotion.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>For I am poor and needy; </p><p class="indent"> my heart is wounded within me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>I am fading away like a lengthening shadow; </p><p class="indent"> I am shaken off like a locust.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>My knees are weak from fasting, </p><p class="indent"> and my body grows lean and gaunt.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>I am an object of scorn to my accusers; </p><p class="indent"> when they see me, they shake their heads.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">26</span>Help me, O LORD my God; </p><p class="indent"> save me according to Your loving devotion.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Let them know that this is Your hand, </p><p class="indent"> that You, O LORD, have done it.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Though they curse, You will bless. </p><p class="indent"> When they rise up, they will be put to shame, </p><p class="indent"> but Your servant will rejoice.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>May my accusers be clothed with disgrace; </p><p class="indent"> may they wear their shame like a robe.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>With my mouth I will thank the LORD profusely; </p><p class="indent"> I will praise Him in the presence of many.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>For He stands at the right hand of the needy one, </p><p class="indent"> to save him from the condemners of his soul.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Cited in Acts 1:20<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew; LXX <i class="calibre6">may they be driven</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
