<font ><b>Jesus Our Advocate</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >My little children, I am writing these
things to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we
have an advocate before the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.
He Himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for
ours but also for the sins of the whole world. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >By this we can be sure that we have come
to know Him: if we keep His commandments. If anyone says, “I know
Him,” but does not keep His commandments, he is a liar, and the
truth is not in him. But if anyone keeps His word, the love of God
has been truly perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him:
Whoever claims to abide in Him must walk as Jesus walked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Beloved, I am not writing to you a new
commandment, but an old one, which you have had from the beginning.
This commandment is the message you have heard. Then again, I am also
writing to you a new commandment, which is true in Him and also in
you. For the darkness is fading and the true light is already
shining. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If anyone claims to be in the light but
hates his brother, he is still in the darkness. Whoever loves his
brother remains in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in
him. But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in
the darkness. He does not know where he is going, because the
darkness has blinded his eyes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I am writing to you, little children,
because your sins have been forgiven through His name. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I am writing to you, fathers, because you
know Him who is from the beginning. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I am writing to you, young men, because
you have overcome the evil one. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I have written to you, children, because
you know the Father. </font>

<font >I have written to you, fathers, because
you know Him who is from the beginning. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I have written to you, young men, because
you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have
overcome the evil one. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not love the world or anything in the
world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in
him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh, the
desires of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not from the Father
but from the world. The world is passing away, along with its
desires; but whoever does the will of God remains forever. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Children, it is the last hour; and just as
you have heard that the antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists
have appeared. This is how we know it is the last hour. They went out
from us, but they did not belong to us. For if they had belonged to
us, they would have remained with us. But their departure made it
clear that none of them belonged to us. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You, however, have an anointing from the
Holy One, and all of you know the truth. I have not written to you
because you lack knowledge of the truth, but because you have it, and
because no lie comes from the truth. Who is the liar, if it is not
the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist,
who denies the Father and the Son. Whoever denies the Son does not
have the Father, but whoever confesses the Son has the Father as
well. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for you, let what you have heard from
the beginning remain in you. If it does, you will also remain in the
Son and in the Father. And this is the promise that He Himself made
to us: eternal life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I have written these things to you about
those who are trying to deceive you. And as for you, the anointing
you received from Him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to
teach you. But just as His true and genuine anointing teaches you
about all things, so remain in Him as you have been taught. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And now, little children, remain in
Christ, so that when He appears, we may be confident and unashamed
before Him at His coming. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If you know that He is righteous, you also
know that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of Him. </font>
