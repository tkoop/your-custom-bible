<font><font face="Tahoma, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt"><b>Deuteronomy
1</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Leaving Horeb</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">These are the words that Moses spoke to
all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan—in the Arabah
opposite Suph—between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and
Dizahab. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb to
Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Seir. In the fortieth year, on the
first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites
all that the LORD had commanded him concerning them. This was after
he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and
then at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On the east side of the Jordan in the land
of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD our God said to us at Horeb: “You
have stayed at this mountain long enough. Resume your journey and go
to the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring
peoples in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the foothills, in the
Negev, and along the seacoast to the land of the Canaanites and to
Lebanon, as far as the great River Euphrates. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">See, I have placed the land before you.
Enter and possess the land that the LORD swore He would give to your
fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants after
them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time I said to you, “I cannot
carry the burden for you alone. The LORD your God has multiplied you,
so that today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky. May the
LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times over and
bless you as He has promised. But how can I bear your troubles,
burdens, and disputes all by myself? Choose for yourselves wise,
understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will
appoint them as your leaders.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And you answered me and said, “What you
propose to do is good.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise
and respected men, and appointed them as leaders over you—as
commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens, and as
officers for your tribes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time I charged your judges: “Hear
the disputes between your brothers, and judge fairly between a man
and his brother or a foreign resident. Show no partiality in judging;
hear both small and great alike. Do not be intimidated by anyone, for
judgment belongs to God. And bring to me any case too difficult for
you, and I will hear it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And at that time I commanded you all the
things you were to do. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And just as the LORD our God had commanded
us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the
Amorites, through all the vast and terrifying wilderness you have
seen. When we reached Kadesh-barnea, I said: “You have reached the
hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.
See, the LORD your God has placed the land before you. Go up and take
possession of it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has told you.
Do not be afraid or discouraged.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all of you approached me and said,
“Let us send men ahead of us to search out the land and bring us
word of what route to follow and which cities to enter.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The plan seemed good to me, so I selected
twelve men from among you, one from each tribe. They left and went up
into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied out
the land. They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands,
carried it down to us, and brought us word: “It is a good land that
the LORD our God is giving us.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But you were unwilling to go up; you
rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You grumbled in
your tents and said, “Because the LORD hates us, He has brought us
out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites
to be annihilated. Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts
melt, saying: ‘The people are larger and taller than we are; the
cities are large, with walls up to the heavens. We even saw the
descendants of the Anakim there.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I said to you: “Do not be terrified
or afraid of them! The LORD your God, who goes before you, will fight
for you, just as you saw Him do for you in Egypt and in the
wilderness, where the LORD your God carried you, as a man carries his
son, all the way by which you traveled until you reached this place.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But in spite of all this, you did not
trust the LORD your God, who went before you on the journey, in the
fire by night and in the cloud by day, to seek out a place for you to
camp and to show you the road to travel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the LORD heard your words, He grew
angry and swore an oath, saying, “Not one of the men of this evil
generation shall see the good land I swore to give your fathers,
except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him
and his descendants the land on which he has set foot, because he
followed the LORD wholeheartedly.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The LORD was also angry with me on your
account, and He said, “Not even you shall enter the land. Joshua
son of Nun, who stands before you, will enter it. Encourage him, for
he will enable Israel to inherit the land. And the little ones you
said would become captives—your children who on that day did not
know good from evil—will enter the land that I will give them, and
they will possess it. But you are to turn back and head for the
wilderness along the route to the Red Sea.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">We have sinned against the LORD,” you
replied. “We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God has
commanded us.” Then each of you put on his weapons of war, thinking
it easy to go up into the hill country. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the LORD said to me, “Tell them not
to go up and fight, for I am not with you to keep you from defeat by
your enemies.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So I spoke to you, but you would not
listen. You rebelled against the command of the LORD and
presumptuously went up into the hill country. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the Amorites who lived in the hills
came out against you and chased you like a swarm of bees. They routed
you from Seir all the way to Hormah. And you returned and wept before
the LORD, but He would not listen to your voice or give ear to you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For this reason you stayed in Kadesh for a
long time—a very long time. </font>
