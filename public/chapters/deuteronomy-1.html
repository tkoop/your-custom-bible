<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Command to Leave Horeb<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 33:1–6)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel in the wilderness east of the Jordan—in the Arabah opposite Suph—between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb<span class="fn">a</span>  to Kadesh-barnea by way of Mount Seir.
<span class="reftext">3</span>In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded him concerning them.
<span class="reftext">4</span>This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and then at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>On the east side of the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying:<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> our God said to us at Horeb: “You have stayed at this mountain long enough.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Resume <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> journey and go to the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the foothills,<span class="fn">c</span>  in the Negev, and along the seacoast to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great River Euphrates.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>See, I have placed the land before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>. Enter and possess the land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> swore <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> would give to <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants after them.”
</p><p class="hdg">Moses Appoints Leaders<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 18:13–27)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>At that time I said to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, “I cannot carry the burden for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> alone.
<span class="reftext">10</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God has multiplied <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, so that today <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are as numerous as the stars in the sky.
<span class="reftext">11</span>May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers, increase you a thousand times over and bless <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has promised.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But how can I bear your troubles, burdens, and disputes all by myself?
<span class="reftext">13</span>Choose for yourselves wise, understanding, and respected men from each of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> tribes, and I will appoint them as <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> leaders.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> answered me and said, “What you propose to do is good.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So I took the leaders of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them as leaders over <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>—as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens, and as officers for <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> tribes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>At that time I charged <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> judges: “Hear the disputes between <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> brothers, and judge fairly between a man and his brother or a foreign resident.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Show no partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be intimidated by anyone, for <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> belongs to God. And bring to me any case too difficult for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and I will hear it.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>And at that time I commanded <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> all the things <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were to do.
</p><p class="hdg">Twelve Spies Sent Out<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 13:1–33)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>And just as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God had commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites, through all the vast and terrifying wilderness <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have seen. When we reached Kadesh-barnea,
<span class="reftext">20</span>I said: “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God is giving us.
<span class="reftext">21</span>See, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God has placed the land before you. Go up and take possession of it as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of your fathers, has told you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then all of you approached me and said, “Let us send men ahead of us to search out the land and bring us word of what route to follow and which cities to enter.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>The plan seemed good to me, so I selected twelve men from among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, one from each tribe.
<span class="reftext">24</span>They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span> of Eshcol and spied out the land.
<span class="reftext">25</span>They took some of the fruit of the land in their hands, carried it down to us, and brought us word: “It is a good land that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God is giving us.”
</p><p class="hdg">Israel’s Rebellion<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 14:1–12)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>But <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were unwilling to go up; <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> rebelled against the command of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God.
<span class="reftext">27</span><span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> grumbled in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> tents and said, “Because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> hates us, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to be annihilated.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying: ‘The people are larger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the heavens. We even saw the descendants of the Anakim there.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>So I said to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>: “Do not be terrified or afraid of them!
<span class="reftext">30</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God, who goes before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, will fight for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, just as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> saw <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> do for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> in Egypt
<span class="reftext">31</span>and in the wilderness, where <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way by which <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> until <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> reached this place.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>But in spite of all this, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> did not trust <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God,
<span class="reftext">33</span>who went before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> on the journey, in the fire by night and in the cloud by day, to seek out a place for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to camp and to show <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> the road to travel.
</p><p class="hdg">Israel’s Penalty<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Numbers 14:20–35)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>When <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> heard <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> words, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> grew angry and swore an oath, saying,
<span class="reftext">35</span>“Not one of the men of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers,
<span class="reftext">36</span>except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land on which he has set foot, because he followed <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> wholeheartedly.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> was also angry with me on your account, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said, “Not even you shall enter the land.
<span class="reftext">38</span>Joshua son of Nun, who stands before you, will enter it. Encourage him, for he will enable Israel to inherit the land.
<span class="reftext">39</span>And the little ones <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> said would become captives—<span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> children who on that day did not know good from evil—will enter the land that I will give them, and they will possess it.
<span class="reftext">40</span>But <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are to turn back and head for the wilderness along the route to the Red <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span>.<span class="fn">d</span>”

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>But <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me, “Tell them not to go up and fight, for I am not with you to keep <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from defeat by <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> enemies.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>So I spoke to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, but <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> would not listen. <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> rebelled against the command of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and presumptuously went up into the hill country.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>Then the Amorites who lived in the hills came out against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and chased <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> like a swarm of bees.
