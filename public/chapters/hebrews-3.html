<font >Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the
heavenly calling, set your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high
priest whom we confess. He was faithful to the One who appointed Him,
just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >For Jesus has been counted worthy of
greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater
honor than the house itself. And every house is built by someone, but
God is the builder of everything. </font>

<font >Now Moses was faithful as a servant in all
God’s house, testifying to what would be spoken later. But Christ
is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are His house, if

exhort one another daily, as long as it is called today, so that none
