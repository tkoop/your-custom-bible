<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jesus Our Apostle and High Priest</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, set your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.
<span class="reftext">2</span>He was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honour than the house itself.
<span class="reftext">4</span>And every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house,<span class="fn">b</span>  testifying to what would be spoken later.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But Christ is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are His house, if we hold firmly<span class="fn">c</span>  to our confidence and the hope of which we boast.
</p><p class="hdg">Do Not Harden Your Hearts<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 95:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Today, if you hear His voice,
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">8</span>do not harden your hearts, </p><p class="indent1"> as you did in the rebellion, </p><p class="indent"> in the day of testing in the wilderness,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>where your fathers tested and tried Me, </p><p class="indent"> and for forty years saw My works.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore I was angry with that generation, </p><p class="indent"> and I said, </p><p class="indent1">‘Their hearts are always going astray, </p><p class="indent"> and they have not known My ways.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So I swore on oath in My anger, </p><p class="indent">‘They shall never enter My rest.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Peril of Unbelief</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>See to it, brothers, that none of you has a wicked heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God.
<span class="reftext">13</span>But exhort one another daily, as long as it is called today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance we had at first.
<span class="reftext">15</span>As it has been said: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Today, if you hear His voice, </p><p class="indent"> do not harden your hearts, </p><p class="indent1"> as you did in the rebellion.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>For who were the ones who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?
<span class="reftext">17</span>And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
<span class="reftext">18</span>And to whom did He swear that they would never enter His rest? Was it not to those who disobeyed?
<span class="reftext">19</span>So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were unable to enter.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">just as Moses in all His house</i>; SBL <i class="calibre6">just as Moses in His house</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Numbers 12:7<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> NE, WH, BYZ, and TR include <i class="calibre6">to the end</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Psalm 95:7–11 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">15</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Psalm 95:7–8<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
