<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">That night sleep escaped the king; so he
ordered the Book of Records, the Chronicles, to be brought in and
read to him. And there it was found recorded that Mordecai had
exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the eunuchs who guarded the
king’s entrance, when they had conspired to assassinate King
Xerxes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king inquired, “What honor or
dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this act?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Nothing has been done for him,”
replied the king’s attendants. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Who is in the court?” the king asked.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Haman had just entered the outer court
of the palace to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows he had
prepared for him. So the king’s attendants answered him, “Haman
is there, standing in the court.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Bring him in,” ordered the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Haman entered, and the king asked him,
“What should be done for the man whom the king is delighted to
honor?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Haman thought to himself, “Whom
would the king be delighted to honor more than me?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Haman told the king, “For the man
whom the king is delighted to honor, have them bring a royal robe
that the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself
has ridden—one with a royal crest placed on its head. Let the robe
and the horse be entrusted to one of the king’s most noble princes.
Let them array the man the king wants to honor and parade him on the
horse through the city square, proclaiming before him, ‘This is
what is done for the man whom the king is delighted to honor!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Hurry,” said the king to Haman, “and
do just as you proposed. Take the robe and the horse to Mordecai the
Jew, who is sitting at the king’s gate. Do not neglect anything
that you have suggested.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Haman took the robe and the horse,
arrayed Mordecai, and paraded him through the city square, crying out
before him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king is
delighted to honor!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Mordecai returned to the king’s
gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his
friends everything that had happened. His advisers and his wife
Zeresh said to him, “Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has
begun, is Jewish, you will not prevail against him—for surely you
will fall before him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While they were still speaking with Haman,
the king’s eunuchs arrived and rushed him to the banquet that
Esther had prepared. </font>
