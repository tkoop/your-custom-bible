<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Ravens Feed Elijah</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was among the settlers of Gilead,<span class="fn">a</span>  said to Ahab, “As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives—the God of Israel before whom I stand—there will be neither dew nor rain in these years except at my word!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Then a revelation from <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Elijah:
<span class="reftext">3</span>“Leave here, turn eastward, and hide yourself by the <span class='cap'>Brook</span><span class='nocap'>brook</span> of Cherith, east of the Jordan.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And you are to drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So Elijah did what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had told him, and he went and lived by the <span class='cap'>Brook</span><span class='nocap'>brook</span> of Cherith, east of the Jordan.
<span class="reftext">6</span>The ravens would bring him bread and meat in the morning and evening, and he would drink from the brook.
<span class="reftext">7</span>Some time later, however, the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.
</p><p class="hdg">The Widow of Zarephath</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> came to Elijah:
<span class="reftext">9</span>“Get up and go to Zarephath of Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So Elijah got up and went to Zarephath. When he arrived at the city gate, there was a widow gathering sticks. Elijah called to her and said, “Please bring me a little water in a cup, so that I may drink.”
<span class="reftext">11</span>And as she was going to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a piece of bread.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>But she replied, “As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> your God lives, I have no bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. Look, I am gathering a couple of sticks to take home and prepare a meal for myself and my son, so that we may eat it and die.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>“Do not be afraid,” Elijah said to her. “Go and do as you have said. But first make me a small cake of bread from what you have, and bring it out to me. Afterward, make some for yourself and your son,
<span class="reftext">14</span>for this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be exhausted and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> sends rain upon the face of the earth.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So she went and did according to the word of Elijah, and there was food every day for Elijah and the woman and her household.
<span class="reftext">16</span>The jar of flour was not exhausted and the jug of oil did not run dry, according to the word that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had spoken through Elijah.
</p><p class="hdg">Elijah Raises the Widow’s Son</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Later, the son of the woman who owned the house became ill, and his sickness grew worse and worse, until no breath remained in him.
<span class="reftext">18</span>“O man of God,” said the woman to Elijah, “what have you done to me? Have you come to remind me of my iniquity and cause the death of my son?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>But Elijah said to her, “Give me your son.” </p><p class="reg1"> So he took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his own bed.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Then he cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span> my God, have <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span>an class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span> also brought tragedy on this widow who has opened her home to me, by causing her son to die?”
<span class="reftext">21</span>Then he stretched himself out over the child three times and cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, “O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span> my God, please let this boy’s life return to him!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> listened to the voice of Elijah, and the child’s life returned to him, and he lived.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Then Elijah took the child, brought him down from the upper room into the house, and gave him to his mother. “Look, your son is alive,” Elijah declared.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> from your mouth is truth.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">who was from Tishbe in Gilead</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Cherith Ravine, near the Jordan</i>; also in verse 5<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
