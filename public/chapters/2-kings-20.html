<font ><b>Hezekiah’s Illness and Recovery</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In those days Hezekiah became mortally
ill. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came to him and said, “This is
what the LORD says: ‘Put your house in order, for you are about to
die; you will not recover.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall
and prayed to the LORD, saying, “Please, O LORD, remember how I
have walked before You faithfully and with wholehearted devotion; I
have done what was good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Before Isaiah had left the middle
courtyard, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, “Go back and
tell Hezekiah the leader of My people that this is what the LORD, the
God of your father David, says: ‘I have heard your prayer; I have
seen your tears. I will surely heal you. On the third day from now
you will go up to the house of the LORD. I will add fifteen years to
your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the
king of Assyria. I will defend this city for My sake and for the sake
of My servant David.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Isaiah said, “Prepare a poultice of
figs.” So they brought it and applied it to the boil, and Hezekiah
recovered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, “What
will be the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I will go up to
the house of the LORD on the third day?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Isaiah had replied, “This will be a
sign to you from the LORD that He will do what He has promised: Would
you like the shadow to go forward ten steps, or back ten steps?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >It is easy for the shadow to lengthen
ten steps,” answered Hezekiah, “but not for it to go back ten
steps.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Isaiah the prophet called out to the
LORD, and He brought the shadow back the ten steps it had descended
on the stairway of Ahaz. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Merodach-baladan son of
Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he
had heard about Hezekiah’s illness. And Hezekiah received the
envoys and showed them all that was in his treasure house—the
silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, as well as his
armory—all that was found in his storehouses. There was nothing in
his palace or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the prophet Isaiah went to King
Hezekiah and asked, “Where did those men come from, and what did
they say to you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >They came from a distant land,”
Hezekiah replied, “from Babylon.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What have they seen in your palace?”
Isaiah asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >They have seen everything in my
palace,” answered Hezekiah. “There is nothing among my treasures
that I did not show them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the
word of the LORD: The time will surely come when everything in your
palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will
be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD. And
some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, will be taken
away to be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word
of the LORD that you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “Will
there not at least be peace and security in my lifetime?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Hezekiah,
along with all his might and how he constructed the pool and the
tunnel to bring water into the city, are they not written in the Book
of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and
his son Manasseh reigned in his place. </font>
