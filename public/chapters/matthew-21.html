<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Triumphal Entry<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Zechariah 9:9–13; Mark 11:1–11; Luke 19:28–40; John 12:12–19)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent out two disciples,
<span class="reftext">2</span>saying to them, <span>“Go into the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to Me.
<span class="reftext">3</span>If anyone questions you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>“Say to the Daughter of Zion, </p><p class="indent">‘See, your King comes to you, </p><p class="indent1"> gentle and riding on a donkey, </p><p class="indent"> on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
<span class="reftext">7</span>They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>A massive crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The crowds that went ahead of Him and those that followed were shouting: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Hosanna to the Son of David!”<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent1stline">“Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!”<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent1stline">“Hosanna in the highest!”<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>When Jesus had entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The crowds replied, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Cleanses the Temple<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 11:15–19; Luke 19:45–48; John 2:12–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Jesus entered the temple courts<span class="fn">e</span>  and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
<span class="reftext">13</span>And He declared to them, <span>“It is written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer.’<span class="fn">f</span>  But you are making it ‘a den of robbers.’<span class="fn">g</span>”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The blind and the lame came to Him at the temple, and He healed them.
<span class="reftext">15</span>But the chief priests and scribes were indignant when they saw the wonders He performed and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>“Do You hear what these children are saying?” they asked. </p><p class="reg1"><span>“Yes,”</span> Jesus answered. <span>“Have you never read:</span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered"> ‘From the mouths of children and infants </p><p class="indentred"> You have ordained praise’<span class="fn">h</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where He spent the night.
</p><p class="hdg">The Barren Fig Tree<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 11:12–14; Mark 11:20–25)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>In the morning, as Jesus was returning to the city, He was hungry.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Seeing a fig tree by the road, He went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. <span>“May you never bear fruit again!”</span> He said. And immediately the tree withered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>When the disciples saw this, they marvelled and asked, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">21</span>“Truly I tell you,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.
<span class="reftext">22</span>If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus’ Authority Challenged<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 11:27–33; Luke 20:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>When Jesus returned to the temple courts and began to teach, the chief priests and elders of the people came up to Him. “By what authority are You doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave You this authority?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">24</span>“I will also ask you one question,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“and if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
<span class="reftext">25</span>What was the source of John’s baptism? Was it from heaven or from men?”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> They deliberated among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
<span class="reftext">26</span>But if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid of the people, for they all regard John as a prophet.”
<span class="reftext">27</span>So they answered, “We do not know.” </p><p class="reg1"> And Jesus replied, <span>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Two Sons</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">28</span>But what do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first one and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">29</span>‘I will not,’ he replied. But later he changed his mind and went.<span class="fn">i</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">30</span>Then the man went to the second son and told him the same thing. </p><p class="calibre3">‘I will, sir,’ he said. But he did not go.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">31</span>Which of the two did the will of his father?” </p><p class="reg1">“The first,<span class="fn">j</span>” they answered. </p><p class="reg1"> Jesus said to them, <span>“Truly I tell you, the tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you.
<span class="reftext">32</span>For John came to you in a righteous way and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.</span>
</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Wicked Tenants<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 12:1–12; Luke 20:9–18)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">33</span>Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he rented it out to some tenants and went away on a journey.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">34</span>When the harvest time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the fruit.
<span class="reftext">35</span>But the tenants seized his servants. They beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">36</span>Again, he sent other servants, more than the first group. But the tenants did the same to them.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">37</span>Finally, he sent his son to them. ‘They will respect my son,’ he said.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">38</span>But when the tenants saw the son, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and take his inheritance.’
<span class="reftext">39</span>So they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">40</span>Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those tenants?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>“He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,” they replied, “and will rent out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the fruit at harvest time.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“Have you never read in the Scriptures:</span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘The stone the builders rejected </p><p class="indentred"> has become the cornerstone. </p><p class="indentred1"> This is from the Lord, </p><p class="indentred"> and it is marvellous in our eyes’<span class="fn">k</span>?
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">43</span>Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
<span class="reftext">44</span>He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.<span class="fn">l</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>When the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they knew that Jesus was speaking about them.
<span class="reftext">46</span>Although they wanted to arrest Him, they were afraid of the crowds, because the people regarded Him as a prophet.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Zechariah 9:9<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">Hosanna</i> is a transliteration of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Hosia-na</i>, meaning <i class="calibre6">Save, we pray</i> or <i class="calibre6">Save now</i>, which became a shout of praise; see Psalm 118:25; also in verse 15.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Psalm 118:26<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">“Hosanna in the highest heaven!”</i> See Psalm 118:25 and Psalm 148:1.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i>; also in verses 15 and 23; BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">the temple of God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Isaiah 56:7<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Jeremiah 7:11<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Psalm 8:2 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">29</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> NE and WH <i class="calibre6">But he went.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> NE and WH <i class="calibre6">The latter</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">42</span> <span class="footnotesbot">k</span> Psalm 118:22–23<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">44</span> <span class="footnotesbot">l</span> Tischendorf and some early manuscripts do not include verse 44; see also Luke 20:18.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
