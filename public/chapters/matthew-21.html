<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As they approached Jerusalem and came to
Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent out two disciples,
saying to them, <font color="#a80000">“Go into the village ahead of
you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt
beside her. Untie them and bring them to Me. If anyone questions you,
tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This took place to fulfill what was spoken
through the prophet: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Say to the Daughter of Zion, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
‘<font >See, your King comes to you, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the disciples went and did as Jesus had
directed them. They brought the donkey and the colt and laid their
cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >A massive crowd spread their cloaks on the
road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the
road. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The crowds that went ahead of Him and
those that followed were shouting: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Hosanna to the Son of David!” </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Blessed is He who comes in the name of
the Lord!” </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >Hosanna in the highest!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus had entered Jerusalem, the
whole city was stirred and asked, “Who is this?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The crowds replied, “This is Jesus, the
prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus entered the temple courts and
drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the
tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
And He declared to them, <font color="#a80000">“It is written: ‘My
house will be called a house of prayer.’ But you are making it ‘a
den of robbers.’”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The blind and the lame came to Him at the
temple, and He healed them. But the chief priests and scribes were
indignant when they saw the wonders He performed and the children
shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Do you hear what these children are
saying?” they asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Yes,”</font>
Jesus answered. <font color="#a80000">“Have you never read:</font> </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

praise’?” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He left them and went out of the city
to Bethany, where He spent the night. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the morning, as Jesus was returning to
the city, He was hungry. Seeing a fig tree by the road, He went up to
it but found nothing on it except leaves. <font color="#a80000">“May
you never bear fruit again!”</font> He said. And immediately the
tree withered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the disciples saw this, they marveled
and asked, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Truly I tell
you,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“if you have
faith and do not doubt, not only will you do what was done to the fig
tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and
thrown into the sea,’ it will happen. If you believe, you will
receive whatever you ask for in prayer.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus returned to the temple courts
and began to teach, the chief priests and elders of the people came
up to Him. “By what authority are You doing these things?” they
asked. “And who gave You this authority?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >I will also ask
you one question,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“and
if you answer Me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these
things. What was the source of John’s baptism? Was it from heaven
or from men?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They deliberated among themselves and
said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why then did
you not believe him?’ But if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid
of the people, for they all regard John as a prophet.” So they
answered, “We do not know.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Neither

<font color="#a80000"><font >But what do you
think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first one and
said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’ </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >I will not,’ he
replied. But later he changed his mind and went. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Then the man went to

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font >I will, sir,’

I tell you, the tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the

did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.</font>

<font color="#a80000"><font >Listen to another
parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall

<font color="#a80000"><font >Again, he sent other
servants, more than the first group. But the tenants did the same to
them. </font></font>

“<font >He will bring those wretches to a
