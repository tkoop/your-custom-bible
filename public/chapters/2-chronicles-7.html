<span class="reftext">2</span>The priests were unable to enter the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, because the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had filled it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> above the temple, they bowed down on the <span class='spell ca'>pavement</span><span class='spell gb'>roadway</span><span class='spell us'>pavement</span> with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>: </p><p class="indent1stline">“For <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is good; </p><p class="indent"> His loving devotion endures forever.”
</p><p class="hdg">Sacrifices of Dedication<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Kings 8:62–66)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">5</span>And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>The priests stood at their posts, as did the Levites with the musical instruments of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, which King David had made for giving thanks to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and with which David had offered praise, saying, “For <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> loving devotion endures forever.” Across from the Levites, the priests sounded trumpets, and all the Israelites were standing.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard in front of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and there he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, since the bronze altar he had made could not contain all these offerings.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So at that time Solomon and all Israel with him—a very great assembly of people from Lebo-hamath to the <span class='cap'>Brook</span><span class='nocap'>brook</span> of Egypt—kept the feast<span class="fn">a</span>  for seven days.
<span class="reftext">9</span>On the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for the dedication of the altar had lasted seven days, and the feast seven days more.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, Solomon sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad of heart for the good things that <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had done for David, for Solomon, and for <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> people Israel.

<span class="reftext">12</span><span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> appeared to him at night and said to him: </p><p class="tab1stline">“I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for <span class='cap'>Myself</span><span class='nocap'>myself</span> as a house of sacrifice.
<span class="reftext">13</span>If I close the sky so there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send a plague among <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people,

<span class="reftext">18</span>then I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with your father David when I said, ‘You will never fail to have a man to rule over Israel.’
</p><p class="tab1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>But if you turn away and forsake the statutes and commandments I have set before you, and if you go off to serve and worship other gods,

I will make it an object of scorn and ridicule among all the peoples.

<span class="reftext">22</span>And others will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—because of this, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has brought all this disaster upon them.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the Feast of Tabernacles (or Booths or Shelters); see Leviticus 23:33–36.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Some LXX manuscripts, Syriac, and Arabic; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">And though this temple is now exalted</i>; see also 1 Kings 9:8.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
