<font ><b>Fire from Heaven</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Solomon had finished praying, fire
came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the
sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple. The priests
were unable to enter the house of the LORD, because the glory of the
LORD had filled it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When all the Israelites saw the fire
coming down and the glory of the LORD above the temple, they bowed
down on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they
worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >For He is good; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >His loving devotion endures forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king and all the people offered
sacrifices before the LORD. And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of
22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people
dedicated the house of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The priests stood at their posts, as did
the Levites with the musical instruments of the LORD, which King
David had made for giving thanks to the LORD and with which David had
offered praise, saying, “For His loving devotion endures forever.”
Across from the Levites, the priests sounded trumpets, and all the
Israelites were standing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Solomon consecrated the middle of the
courtyard in front of the house of the LORD, and there he offered the
burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, since the bronze
altar he had made could not contain all these offerings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So at that time Solomon and all Israel
with him—a very great assembly of people from Lebo-hamath to the
Brook of Egypt—kept the feast for seven days. On the eighth day
they held a solemn assembly, for the dedication of the altar had
lasted seven days, and the feast seven days more. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the twenty-third day of the seventh
month, Solomon sent the people away to their homes, joyful and glad
of heart for the good things that the LORD had done for David, for
Solomon, and for His people Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Solomon had finished the house of the
LORD and the royal palace, successfully carrying out all that was in
his heart to do for the house of the LORD and for his own palace, the
LORD appeared to him at night and said to him: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I have heard your prayer and have
chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice. If I close the
sky so there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the
land, or if I send a plague among My people, and if My people who are
called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and
turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive
their sin, and heal their land. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now My eyes will be open and My ears
attentive to the prayers offered in this place. For I have now chosen
and consecrated this temple so that My Name may be there forever. My
eyes and My heart will be there for all time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And as for you, if you walk before Me as
your father David walked, doing all I have commanded you, and if you
keep My statutes and ordinances, then I will establish your royal
throne, as I covenanted with your father David when I said, ‘You
will never fail to have a man to rule over Israel.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But if you turn away and forsake the
statutes and commandments I have set before you, and if you go off to
serve and worship other gods, then I will uproot Israel from the soil
I have given them, and I will banish from My presence this temple I
have sanctified for My Name. I will make it an object of scorn and
ridicule among all the peoples. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when this temple has become a heap of
rubble, all who pass by it will be appalled and say, ‘Why has the
LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’ And others
will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the LORD, the God of their
fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and have embraced
other gods, worshiping and serving them—because of this, He has
brought all this disaster upon them.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font > </font></font><font >”
