<font ><b>The Plague on the Firstborn Foretold</b></font></p>

<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will
bring upon Pharaoh and Egypt one more plague. After that, he will
allow you to leave this place. And when he lets you go, he will drive
you out completely. Now announce to the people that men and women
alike should ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD gave the people favor in the
sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, Moses himself was highly regarded
in Egypt by Pharaoh’s officials and by the people. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses declared, “This is what the
LORD says: ‘About midnight I will go throughout Egypt, and every
firstborn son in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of
Pharaoh who sits on his throne, to the firstborn of the servant girl
behind the hand mill, as well as the firstborn of all the cattle.
Then a great cry will go out over all the land of Egypt. Such an
outcry has never been heard before and will never be heard again. But
among all the Israelites, not even a dog will snarl at man or beast.’

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then you will know that the LORD makes a
distinction between Egypt and Israel. And all these officials of
yours will come and bow before me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the
people who follow you!’ After that, I will depart.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And hot with anger, Moses left Pharaoh’s
presence. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh will
not listen to you, so that My wonders may be multiplied in the land
of Egypt.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moses and Aaron did all these wonders
before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart so that he
would not let the Israelites go out of his land. </font>
