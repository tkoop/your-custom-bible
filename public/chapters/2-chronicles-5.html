</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>At that time Solomon assembled in Jerusalem the elders of Israel—all the tribal heads and family leaders of the Israelites—to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from Zion, the City of David.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So all the men of Israel came together to the king at the feast in the seventh month.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark,
<span class="reftext">5</span>and they brought up the ark and the Tent of Meeting with all its sacred furnishings. The Levitical priests carried them up.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>There, before the ark, King Solomon and the whole congregation of Israel who had assembled with him sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place,<span class="fn">b</span>  beneath the wings of the cherubim.
<span class="reftext">8</span>For the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its poles.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The poles of the ark extended far enough that their ends were visible from in front of the inner sanctuary,<span class="fn">c</span>  but not from outside the Holy Place;<span class="fn">d</span>  and they are there to this day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb,<span class="fn">e</span>  where the LORD had made a covenant with the Israelites after they had come out of Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves regardless of their divisions. And when the priests came out of the Holy Place,
<span class="reftext">12</span>all the Levitical singers—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives—stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps, and lyres, accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.
<span class="reftext">13</span>The trumpeters and singers joined together to praise and thank the LORD with one voice. They lifted up their voices, accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and musical instruments, in praise to the LORD: </p><p class="indent1stline">“For He is good; </p><p class="indent"> His loving devotion endures forever.” </p><p class="reg1"> And the temple, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud
<span class="reftext">14</span>so that the priests could not stand there to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, the Feast of Tabernacles (or Booths or Shelters); see Leviticus 23:33–36.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Holy of Holies</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Some Hebrew manuscripts and LXX <i class="calibre6">The poles extended far enough that their ends were visible from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary</i>; see 1 Kings 8:8.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">not from outside</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, Mount Sinai, or possibly a mountain in the range containing Mount Sinai<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
