<font ><b>The Ark Enters the Temple</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So all the work that Solomon had performed
for the house of the LORD was completed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Solomon brought in the items his
father David had dedicated—the silver, the gold, and all the
furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of the house of
God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time Solomon assembled in
Jerusalem the elders of Israel—all the tribal heads and family
leaders of the Israelites—to bring up the ark of the covenant of
the LORD from Zion, the City of David. So all the men of Israel came
together to the king at the feast in the seventh month. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When all the elders of Israel had arrived,
the Levites took up the ark, and they brought up the ark and the Tent
of Meeting with all its sacred furnishings. The Levitical priests
carried them up. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There, before the ark, King Solomon and
the whole congregation of Israel who had assembled with him
sacrificed so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or
numbered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the priests brought the ark of the
covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the
temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim. For
the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and
overshadowed the ark and its poles. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The poles of the ark extended far enough
that their ends were visible from in front of the inner sanctuary,
but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are there to this day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >There was nothing in the ark except the
two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD had
made a covenant with the Israelites after they had come out of Egypt.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now all the priests who were present had
consecrated themselves regardless of their divisions. And when the
priests came out of the Holy Place, all the Levitical singers—Asaph,
Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives—stood on the east
side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps,
and lyres, accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets. The
trumpeters and singers joined together to praise and thank the LORD
with one voice. They lifted up their voices, accompanied by trumpets,
cymbals, and musical instruments, in praise to the LORD: </font>

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >For He is good; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >His loving devotion endures forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the temple, the house of the LORD, was
filled with a cloud so that the priests could not stand there to
minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the
house of God. </font>
