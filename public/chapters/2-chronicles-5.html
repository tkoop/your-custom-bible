<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that time Solomon assembled in
Jerusalem the elders of Israel—all the tribal heads and family

the LORD from Zion, the City of David. So all the men of Israel came

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the priests brought the ark of the

temple, the Most Holy Place, beneath the wings of the cherubim. For
the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and

consecrated themselves regardless of their divisions. And when the
priests came out of the Holy Place, all the Levitical singers—Asaph,
Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives—stood on the east
side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps,
and lyres, accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets. The
trumpeters and singers joined together to praise and thank the LORD
