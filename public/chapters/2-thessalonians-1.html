<font face="Tahoma, serif">We are obligated to thank God for you all
the time, brothers, as is fitting, because your faith is growing more
and more, and your love for one another is increasing. That is why we
boast among God’s churches about your perseverance and faith in the
face of all the persecution and affliction you are enduring. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">All this is clear evidence of God’s
righteous judgment. And so you will be counted worthy of the kingdom
of God, for which you are suffering. After all, it is only right for
God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant
relief to you who are oppressed and to us as well. This will take
place when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty
angels in blazing fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know
God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will suffer
the penalty of eternal destruction, separated from the presence of
the Lord and the glory of His might, on the day He comes to be
glorified in His saints and regarded with wonder by all who have
believed, including you who have believed our testimony. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">To this end, we always pray for you, that
our God will count you worthy of His calling, and that He will
powerfully fulfill your every good desire and work of faith, so that
the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified in you, and you in Him,
according to the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. </font>
