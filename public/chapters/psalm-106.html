</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>Remember me, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, in Your <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> to Your people; </p><p class="indent"> visit me with Your salvation,

</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>We have sinned like our fathers; </p><p class="indent"> we have done wrong and acted wickedly.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders </p><p class="indent"> or remember Your abundant kindness; </p><p class="indent1"> but they rebelled by the sea, </p><p class="indent"> there at the Red Sea.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Yet He saved them for the sake of His name, </p><p class="indent"> to make His power known.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; </p><p class="indent"> He led them through the depths as through a desert.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>He saved them from the hand that hated them; </p><p class="indent"> He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The waters covered their foes; </p><p class="indent"> not one of them remained.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then they believed His promises </p><p class="indent"> and sang His praise.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Yet they soon forgot His works </p><p class="indent"> and failed to wait for His counsel.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>They craved intensely in the wilderness </p><p class="indent"> and tested God in the desert.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So He granted their request, </p><p class="indent"> but sent a wasting disease upon them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>In the camp they envied Moses, </p><p class="indent"> as well as Aaron, the holy one of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; </p><p class="indent"> it covered the assembly of Abiram.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then fire blazed through their company; </p><p class="indent"> flames consumed the wicked.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">19</span>At Horeb<span class="fn">c</span>  they made a calf </p><p class="indent"> and worshiped a molten image.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>They exchanged their Glory<span class="fn">d</span>  </p><p class="indent"> for the image of a grass-eating ox.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>They forgot God their Savior, </p><p class="indent"> who did great things in Egypt,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>wondrous works in the land of Ham, </p><p class="indent"> and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So He said He would destroy them—</p><p class="indent"> had not Moses His chosen one </p><p class="indent1"> stood before Him in the breach </p><p class="indent"> to divert His wrath from destroying them.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">24</span>They despised the pleasant land; </p><p class="indent"> they did not believe His promise.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>They grumbled in their tents </p><p class="indent"> and did not listen to the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>So He raised His hand and swore </p><p class="indent"> to cast them down in the wilderness,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>to disperse<span class="fn">e</span>  their offspring among the nations </p><p class="indent"> and scatter them throughout the lands.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">28</span>They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor </p><p class="indent"> and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>So they provoked <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to anger with their deeds, </p><p class="indent"> and a plague broke out among them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>But Phinehas stood and intervened, </p><p class="indent"> and the plague was restrained.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>It was credited to him as righteousness </p><p class="indent"> for endless generations to come.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">32</span>At the waters of Meribah<span class="fn">f</span>  they angered <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, </p><p class="indent"> and trouble came to Moses because of them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>For they rebelled against His Spirit,<span class="fn">g</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and Moses spoke rashly with his lips.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">34</span>They did not destroy the peoples </p><p class="indent"> as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had commanded them,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>but they mingled with the nations </p><p class="indent"> and adopted their customs.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">36</span>They worshiped their idols, </p><p class="indent"> which became a snare to them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">37</span>They sacrificed their sons </p><p class="indent"> and their daughters to demons.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">38</span>They shed innocent blood—</p><p class="indent"> the blood of their sons and daughters, </p><p class="indent1"> whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, </p><p class="indent"> and the land was polluted with blood.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">39</span>They defiled themselves by their actions </p><p class="indent"> and prostituted themselves by their deeds.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">40</span>So the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against His people, </p><p class="indent"> and He abhorred His own inheritance.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">41</span>He delivered them into the hand of the nations, </p><p class="indent"> and those who hated them ruled over them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">42</span>Their enemies oppressed them, </p><p class="indent"> and subdued them under their hand.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">43</span>Many times He rescued them, </p><p class="indent"> but they were bent on rebellion </p><p class="indent"> and sank down in their iniquity.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">44</span>Nevertheless He heard their cry; </p><p class="indent"> He took note of their distress.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">45</span>And He remembered His covenant with them, </p><p class="indent"> and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">46</span>He made them objects of compassion </p><p class="indent"> to all who held them captive.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">47</span>Save us, O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span> our God, </p><p class="indent"> and gather us from the nations, </p><p class="indent1"> that we may give thanks to Your holy name, </p><p class="indent"> that we may glory in Your praise.
