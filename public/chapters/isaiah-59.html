<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Sin Separates Us from God<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 14:1–7; Psalm 53:1–6; Romans 3:9–20)</span></p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">1</span>Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, </p><p class="indent"> nor His ear too dull to hear.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>But your iniquities have built barriers </p><p class="indent"> between you and your God, </p><p class="indent1"> and your sins have hidden His face from you, </p><p class="indent"> so that He does not hear.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For your hands are stained with blood, </p><p class="indent"> and your fingers with iniquity; </p><p class="indent1"> your lips have spoken lies, </p><p class="indent"> and your tongue mutters injustice.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">4</span>No one calls for justice; </p><p class="indent"> no one pleads his case honestly. </p><p class="indent1"> They rely on empty pleas; they tell lies; </p><p class="indent"> they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>They hatch the eggs of vipers </p><p class="indent"> and weave a spider’s web. </p><p class="indent1"> Whoever eats their eggs will die; </p><p class="indent"> crack one open, and a viper is hatched.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Their cobwebs cannot be made into clothing, </p><p class="indent"> and they cannot cover themselves with their works. </p><p class="indent1"> Their deeds are sinful deeds, </p><p class="indent"> and acts of violence are in their hands.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>Their feet run to evil; </p><p class="indent"> they are swift to shed innocent blood. </p><p class="indent1"> Their thoughts are sinful thoughts; </p><p class="indent"> ruin and destruction<span class="fn">a</span>  lie in their wake.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>The way of peace they have not known,<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> and there is no justice in their tracks. </p><p class="indent1"> They have turned them into crooked paths; </p><p class="indent"> no one who treads on them will know peace.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>Therefore justice is far from us, </p><p class="indent"> and righteousness does not reach us. </p><p class="indent1"> We hope for light, but there is darkness; </p><p class="indent"> for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Like the blind, we feel our way along the wall, </p><p class="indent"> groping like those without eyes. </p><p class="indent1"> We stumble at midday as in the twilight; </p><p class="indent"> among the vigorous we are like the dead.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>We all growl like bears </p><p class="indent"> and moan like doves. </p><p class="indent1"> We hope for justice, but find none, </p><p class="indent"> for salvation, but it is far from us.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>For our transgressions are multiplied before You, </p><p class="indent"> and our sins testify against us. </p><p class="indent1"> Our transgressions are indeed with us, </p><p class="indent"> and we know our iniquities:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>rebelling and denying the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> turning away from our God, </p><p class="indent1"> speaking oppression and revolt, </p><p class="indent"> conceiving and uttering lies from the heart.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>So justice is turned away, </p><p class="indent"> and righteousness stands at a distance. </p><p class="indent1"> For truth has stumbled in the public square, </p><p class="indent"> and honesty cannot enter.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Truth is missing, </p><p class="indent"> and whoever turns from evil becomes prey. </p><p class="indent1stline"> The LORD looked and was displeased<span class="fn">c</span>  </p><p class="indent"> that there was no justice.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>He saw that there was no man; </p><p class="indent"> He was amazed that there was no one to intercede. </p><p class="indent1"> So His own arm brought salvation, </p><p class="indent"> and His own righteousness sustained Him.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>He put on righteousness like a breastplate, </p><p class="indent"> and the helmet of salvation on His head; </p><p class="indent1"> He put on garments of vengeance </p><p class="indent"> and wrapped Himself in a cloak of zeal.
</p><p class="hdg">The Covenant of the Redeemer</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>So He will repay according to their deeds: </p><p class="indent"> fury to His enemies, </p><p class="indent"> retribution to His foes, </p><p class="indent"> and recompense to the islands.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So shall they fear the name of the LORD </p><p class="indent"> where the sun sets, </p><p class="indent"> and His glory where it rises. </p><p class="indent1"> For He will come like a raging flood, </p><p class="indent"> driven by the breath of the LORD.<span class="fn">e</span>
