<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Belshazzar’s Feast</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Later, King Belshazzar held a great feast
for a thousand of his nobles, and he drank wine with them. Under the
influence of the wine, Belshazzar gave orders to bring in the gold
and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the
temple in Jerusalem, so that the king could drink from them, along
with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Thus they brought in the gold vessels that
had been taken from the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and
the king drank from them, along with his nobles, his wives, and his
concubines. As they drank the wine, they praised their gods of gold
and silver, bronze and iron, wood and stone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At that moment the fingers of a human hand
appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in
the royal palace. As the king watched the hand that was writing, his
face grew pale and his thoughts so alarmed him that his hips gave way
and his knees knocked together. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The king called out for the enchanters,
astrologers, and diviners to be brought in, and he said to these wise
men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this inscription and tells me its
interpretation will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed
around his neck, and he will be made the third highest ruler in the
kingdom.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So all the king’s wise men came in, but
they could not read the inscription or interpret it for him. Then
King Belshazzar became even more terrified, his face grew even more
pale, and his nobles were bewildered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Hearing the outcry of the king and his
nobles, the queen entered the banquet hall. “O king, may you live
forever!” she said. “Do not let your thoughts terrify you, or
your face grow pale. There is a man in your kingdom who has the
spirit of the holy gods in him. In the days of your father he was
found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like that of the
gods. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar,
appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and
diviners. Your own father, the king, did this because Daniel, the one
he named Belteshazzar, was found to have an extraordinary spirit, as
well as knowledge, understanding, and the ability to interpret
dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems. Summon Daniel,
therefore, and he will give you the interpretation.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Daniel was brought before the king, who
asked him, “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king
brought from Judah? I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in
you, and that you have insight, intelligence, and extraordinary
wisdom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the wise men and enchanters were
brought before me to read this inscription and interpret it for me,
but they could not give its interpretation. But I have heard about
you, that you are able to give interpretations and solve difficult
problems. Therefore, if you can read this inscription and give me its
interpretation, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain
placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler
in the kingdom.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In response, Daniel said to the king, “You
may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone
else. Nevertheless, I will read the inscription for the king and
interpret it for him. As for you, O king, the Most High God gave your
father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness, glory and honor.
Because of the greatness that He bestowed on him, the people of every
nation and language trembled in fear before him. He killed whom he
wished and kept alive whom he wished; he exalted whom he wished and
humbled whom he wished. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when his heart became arrogant and his
spirit was hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne,
and his glory was taken from him. He was driven away from mankind,
and his mind was like that of a beast. He lived with the wild donkeys
and ate grass like an ox, and his body was drenched with the dew of
heaven until he acknowledged that the Most High God rules over the
kingdom of mankind, setting over it whom He wishes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But you his son, O Belshazzar, have not
humbled your heart, even though you knew all this. Instead, you have
exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. The vessels from His
house were brought to you, and as you drank wine from them with your
nobles, wives, and concubines, you praised your gods of silver and
gold, bronze and iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or
understand. But you have failed to glorify the God who holds in His
hand your very breath and all your ways. Therefore He sent the hand
that wrote the inscription. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now this is the inscription that was
written: </font>
</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; text-transform: uppercase; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">MENE, MENE, TEKEL, PARSIN. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And this is the interpretation of the
message: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.4cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">MENE means that God has numbered the days
of your reign and brought it to an end. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">TEKEL means that you have been weighed on
the scales and found deficient. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">PERES means that your kingdom has been
divided and given over to the Medes and Persians.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Belshazzar gave the command, and they
clothed Daniel in purple, placed a gold chain around his neck, and
proclaimed him the third highest ruler in the kingdom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">That very night Belshazzar king of the
Chaldeans was slain, and Darius the Mede received the kingdom at the
age of sixty-two. </font>
