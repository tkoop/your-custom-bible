<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Uproar in Thessalonica</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
<span class="reftext">2</span>As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the <span class='cap'>Scriptures</span><span class='nocap'>scriptures</span>,
<span class="reftext">3</span>explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I am proclaiming to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> is the Christ,” he declared.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few leading women.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The Jews, however, became jealous. So they brought in some troublemakers from the marketplace, formed a mob, and sent the city into an uproar. They raided Jason’s house in search of Paul and Silas, hoping to bring them out to the people.
<span class="reftext">6</span>But when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting, “These men who have turned the world upside down have now come here,
<span class="reftext">7</span>and Jason has welcomed them into his home. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, named Jesus!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>On hearing this, the crowd and city officials were greatly disturbed.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And they collected bond from Jason and the others, and then released them.
</p><p class="hdg">The Character of the Bereans</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>As soon as night had fallen, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went into the Jewish synagogue.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Now the Bereans were more noble-minded than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the <span class='cap'>Scriptures</span><span class='nocap'>scriptures</span> every day to see if these teachings were true.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">12</span>As a result, many of them believed, along with quite a few prominent Greek women and men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that Paul was also proclaiming the word of God in Berea, they went there themselves to incite and agitate the crowds.
<span class="reftext">14</span>The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy remained in Berea.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then returned with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul in Athens</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was deeply disturbed in his spirit to see that the city was full of idols.
<span class="reftext">17</span>So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and God-fearing Gentiles, and in the marketplace with those he met each day.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Some Epicurean and <span class='cap'>Stoic</span><span class='nocap'>stoic</span> philosophers also began to debate with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others said, “He seems to be advocating foreign gods.” They said this because Paul was proclaiming the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So they took Paul and brought him to the Areopagus,<span class="fn">b</span>  where they asked him, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
<span class="reftext">20</span>For you are bringing some strange notions to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Now all the Athenians and foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing more than hearing and articulating new ideas.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Address in the Areopagus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then Paul stood up in the meeting<span class="fn">c</span>  of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that in every way <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are very religious.
<span class="reftext">23</span>For as I walked around and examined <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: </p><p class="reg1"></p><div class="inscrip1"> TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.</div> <p class="calibre3"></p><p class="reg1"> Therefore what <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> worship as something unknown, I now proclaim to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples made by human hands.
<span class="reftext">25</span>Nor is <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> served by human hands, as if <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> needed anything, because <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> gives everyone life and breath and everything else.
<span class="reftext">26</span>From one man<span class="fn">d</span>  <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>God intended that they would seek <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and perhaps reach out for <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and find <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, though <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is not far from each one of us.
<span class="reftext">28</span>‘For in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> we live and move and have our being.’<span class="fn">e</span>  As some of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> own poets have said, ‘We are <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> offspring.’<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Therefore, being offspring of God, we should not think that the <span class='cap'>Divine</span><span class='nocap'>divine</span> <span class='cap'>Being</span><span class='nocap'>being</span> is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by man’s skill and imagination.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Although God overlooked the ignorance of earlier times, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> now commands all people everywhere to repent.
<span class="reftext">31</span>For <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has set a day when <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will judge the world with justice by the Man <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> from the dead.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some began to mock him, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this topic.”
<span class="reftext">33</span>At that, Paul left the Areopagus.
<span class="reftext">34</span>But some<span class="fn">g</span>  joined him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others who were with them.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">with great eagerness, every day examining the Writings, whether these things were so.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Ares Hill</i> or <i class="calibre6">Mars Hill</i>; also in verse 22 and added for clarity in verse 33<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">in the middle</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">From one</i>; BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">From one blood</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> This is probably a quote from the Cretan philosopher Epimenides of Knossos.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> This is probably a quote from the poem “Phainomena” by the Cilician philosopher Aratus.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">34</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">some men</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
