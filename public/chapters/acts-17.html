<font ><b>The Character of the Bereans</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they had passed through Amphipolis
and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish
synagogue. As was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue, and on
three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining
and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead.
“This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ,” he declared.
Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with
a large number of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few leading women. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Jews, however, became jealous. So they
brought in some troublemakers from the marketplace, formed a mob, and
sent the city into an uproar. They raided Jason’s house in search
of Paul and Silas, hoping to bring them out to the people. But when
they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers
before the city officials, shouting, “These men who have turned the
world upside down have now come here, and Jason has welcomed them
into his home. They are all defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that
there is another king, named Jesus!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On hearing this, the crowd and city
officials were greatly disturbed. And they collected bond from Jason
and the others, and then released them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As soon as night had fallen, the brothers
sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went into
the Jewish synagogue. Now the Bereans were more noble-minded than the
Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and
examined the Scriptures every day to see if these teachings were
true. As a result, many of them believed, along with quite a few
prominent Greek women and men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when the Jews from Thessalonica
learned that Paul was also proclaiming the word of God in Berea, they
went there themselves to incite and agitate the crowds. The brothers
immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy remained in
Berea. Those who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then
returned with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon
as possible. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Paul was waiting for them in Athens,
he was deeply disturbed in his spirit to see that the city was full
of idols. So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and
God-fearing Gentiles, and in the marketplace with those he met each
day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also
began to debate with him. Some of them asked, “What is this babbler
trying to say?” Others said, “He seems to be advocating foreign
gods.” They said this because Paul was proclaiming the good news of
Jesus and the resurrection. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they took Paul and brought him to the
Areopagus, where they asked him, “May we know what this new
teaching is that you are presenting? For you are bringing some
strange notions to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now all the Athenians and foreigners who
lived there spent their time doing nothing more than hearing and
articulating new ideas. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Paul stood up in the meeting of the
Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that in every way you are
very religious. For as I walked around and examined your objects of
worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: </font>
</p>
<p class="western" align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
<span style="text-transform: uppercase"><font >TO
AN UNKNOWN GOD.</font></span></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore what you worship as something
unknown, I now proclaim to you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The God who made the world and everything
in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples
made by human hands. Nor is He served by human hands, as if He needed
anything, because He Himself gives everyone life and breath and
everything else. From one man He made every nation of men, that they
should inhabit the whole earth; and He determined their appointed
times and the boundaries of their lands. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >God intended that they would seek Him and
perhaps reach out for Him and find Him, though He is not far from
each one of us. ‘For in Him we live and move and have our being.’
As some of your own poets have said, ‘We are His offspring.’
Therefore, being offspring of God, we should not think that the
Divine Being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by
man’s skill and imagination. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Although God overlooked the ignorance of
earlier times, He now commands all people everywhere to repent. For
He has set a day when He will judge the world with justice by the Man
He has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising
Him from the dead.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they heard about the resurrection of
the dead, some began to mock him, but others said, “We want to hear
you again on this topic.” At that, Paul left the Areopagus. But
some joined him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, a
woman named Damaris, and others who were with them. </font>
