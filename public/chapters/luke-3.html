<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Mission of John the Baptist<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 40:1–5; Matthew 3:1–12; Mark 1:1–8; John 1:19–28)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
<span class="reftext">2</span>during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>He went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,
<span class="reftext">4</span>as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: </p><p class="indent1stline">“A voice of one calling in the wilderness, </p><p class="indent">‘Prepare the way for the Lord, </p><p class="indent"> make straight paths for <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Every valley shall be filled in, </p><p class="indent"> and every mountain and hill made low. </p><p class="indent1"> The crooked ways shall be made straight, </p><p class="indent"> and the rough ways smooth.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>And all humanity will see God’s salvation.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
<span class="reftext">8</span>Produce fruit, then, in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
<span class="reftext">9</span>The axe lies ready at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>The crowds asked him, “What then should we do?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>John replied, “Whoever has two tunics should share with him who has none, and whoever has food should do the same.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>“Collect no more than you are authorized,” he answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?” </p><p class="reg1">“Do not take money by force or false accusation,” he said. “Be content with your wages.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John could be the Christ.
<span class="reftext">16</span>John answered all of them: “I <span class='spell ca'>baptize</span><span class='spell gb'>baptise</span><span class='spell us'>baptize</span> you with water,<span class="fn">b</span>  but <span class='cap'>One</span><span class='nocap'>one</span> more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.<span class="fn">c</span>  He will <span class='spell ca'>baptize</span><span class='spell gb'>baptise</span><span class='spell us'>baptize</span> you with the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> and with fire.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">17</span>His winnowing fork is in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> hand to clear <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> threshing floor and to gather the wheat into <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> barn; but <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>With these and many other exhortations, John proclaimed the good news to the people.
<span class="reftext">19</span>But when he rebuked Herod the tetrarch regarding his brother’s wife Herodias and all the evils he had done,
<span class="reftext">20</span>Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.
