<font ><b>Curtains for the Tabernacle</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >You are to construct the tabernacle
itself with ten curtains of finely spun linen, each with blue,
purple, and scarlet yarn, and cherubim skillfully worked into them.
Each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide
—all curtains the same size. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Five of the curtains are to be joined
together, and the other five joined as well. Make loops of blue
material on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and do the
same for the end curtain in the second set. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty
loops on the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops line up
opposite one another. Make fifty gold clasps as well, and join the
curtains together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle will be a
unit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are to make curtains of goat hair for
the tent over the tabernacle—eleven curtains in all. Each of the
eleven curtains is to be the same size—thirty cubits long and four
cubits wide. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Join five of the curtains into one set and
the other six into another. Then fold the sixth curtain over double
at the front of the tent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make fifty loops along the edge of the end
curtain in the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the
corresponding curtain in the second set. Make fifty bronze clasps and
put them through the loops to join the tent together as a unit. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the overlap that remains of the
tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over shall hang down
over the back of the tabernacle. And the tent curtains will be a
cubit longer on either side, and the excess will hang over the sides
of the tabernacle to cover it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Also make a covering for the tent out of
ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of fine leather. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are to construct upright frames of
acacia wood for the tabernacle. Each frame is to be ten cubits long
and a cubit and a half wide. Two tenons must be connected to each
other for each frame. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this
way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Construct twenty frames for the south side
of the tabernacle, with forty silver bases under the twenty
frames—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the second side of the tabernacle, the
north side, make twenty frames and forty silver bases—two bases
under each frame. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make six frames for the rear of the
tabernacle, the west side, and two frames for the two back corners of
the tabernacle, coupled together from bottom to top and fitted into a
single ring. These will serve as the two corners. So there are to be
eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are also to make five crossbars of
acacia wood for the frames on one side of the tabernacle, five for
those on the other side, and five for those on the rear side of the
tabernacle, to the west. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The central crossbar in the middle of the
frames shall extend from one end to the other. Overlay the frames
with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the
crossbars with gold. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So you are to set up the tabernacle
according to the pattern shown you on the mountain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet
yarn, and finely spun linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it.
Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood, overlaid with
gold and standing on four silver bases. And hang the veil from the
clasps and place the ark of the Testimony behind the veil. So the
veil will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Put the mercy seat on the ark of the
Testimony in the Most Holy Place. And place the table outside the
veil on the north side of the tabernacle, and put the lampstand
opposite the table, on the south side. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the entrance to the tent, you are to
make a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and
finely spun linen. Make five posts of acacia wood for the curtain,
overlay them with gold hooks, and cast five bronze bases for them. </font>
