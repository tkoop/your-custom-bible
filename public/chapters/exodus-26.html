<span class="reftext">2</span>Each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide<span class="fn">a</span> —all curtains the same size.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Five of the curtains are to be joined together, and the other five joined as well.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Make loops of blue material on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and do the same for the end curtain in the second set.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops line up opposite one another.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Make fifty gold clasps as well, and join the curtains together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle will be a unit.
</p><p class="hdg">The Eleven Curtains of Goat Hair<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 36:14–19)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>You are to make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven curtains in all.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Each of the eleven curtains is to be the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Join five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another. Then fold the sixth curtain over double at the front of the tent.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Make fifty bronze clasps and put them through the loops to join the tent together as a unit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>As for the overlap that remains of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over shall hang down over the back of the tabernacle.
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the tent curtains will be a cubit<span class="fn">c</span>  longer on either side, and the excess will hang over the sides of the tabernacle to cover it.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Also make a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of fine leather.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Frames and Bases<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 36:20–34)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>You are to construct upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Two tenons<span class="fn">f</span>  must be connected to each other for each frame. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Construct twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle,
<span class="reftext">19</span>with forty silver bases under the twenty frames—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>For the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, make twenty frames
<span class="reftext">21</span>and forty silver bases—two bases under each frame.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Make six frames for the rear of the tabernacle, the west side,
<span class="reftext">23</span>and two frames for the two back corners of the tabernacle,
<span class="reftext">24</span>coupled together from bottom to top and fitted into a single ring. These will serve as the two corners.
<span class="reftext">25</span>So there are to be eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>You are also to make five crossbars of acacia wood for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
<span class="reftext">27</span>five for those on the other side, and five for those on the rear side of the tabernacle, to the west.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>The central crossbar in the middle of the frames shall extend from one end to the other.
<span class="reftext">29</span>Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>So you are to set up the tabernacle according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.
</p><p class="hdg">The Veil<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 36:35–36)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Make a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it.
<span class="reftext">32</span>Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood, overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases.
<span class="reftext">33</span>And hang the veil from the clasps and place the ark of the <span class='cap'>Testimony</span><span class='nocap'>testimony</span><span class='bsb'>Testimony</span><span class="fn">g</span>  behind the veil. So the veil will separate the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span><span class='bsb'>Place</span> from the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span><span class='bsb'>Most</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span><span class='bsb'>Place</span>.<span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Put the mercy seat on the ark of the <span class='cap'>Testimony</span><span class='nocap'>testimony</span><span class='bsb'>Testimony</span> in the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span><span class='bsb'>Most</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span><span class='bsb'>Holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span><span class='bsb'>Place</span>.
<span class="reftext">35</span>And place the table outside the veil on the north side of the tabernacle, and put the lampstand opposite the table, on the south side.
</p><p class="hdg">The Curtain for the Entrance<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 36:37–38)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>For the entrance to the tent, you are to make a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen.
<span class="reftext">37</span>Make five posts of acacia wood for the curtain, overlay them with gold hooks, and cast five bronze bases for them.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Each of the ten curtains was approximately 42 feet long and 6 feet wide (12.8 meters long and 1.8 meters wide).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Each of the eleven curtains was approximately 45 feet long and 6 feet wide (13.7 meters long and 1.8 meters wide).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">A cubit</i> is approximately 18 inches or 45.7 centimeters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Possibly the hides of large aquatic mammals<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Each frame was approximately 15 feet long and 2.25 feet wide (4.6 meters long and 68.6 centimeters wide).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> That is, projecting pieces of wood made for insertion into another piece; similarly in verse 19.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> That is, <i class="calibre6">the ark of the covenant</i>; also in verse 34<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">33</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Holy of Holies</i>; also in verse 34<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
