<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Babylon Is Fallen<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Isaiah 21:1–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After this I saw another angel descending from heaven with great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And he cried out in a mighty voice: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!<span class="fn">a</span>  </p><p class="indent"> She has become a lair for demons </p><p class="indent1"> and a haunt for every unclean spirit, </p><p class="indent"> every unclean bird, </p><p class="indent"> and every detestable beast.<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>All the nations have drunk<span class="fn">c</span>  the wine </p><p class="indent"> of the passion of her immorality. </p><p class="indent1"> The kings of the earth were immoral with her, </p><p class="indent"> and the merchants of the earth have grown wealthy </p><p class="indent"> from the extravagance of her luxury.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then I heard another voice from heaven say: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Come out of her, My people,<span class="fn">d</span>  </p><p class="indent"> so that you will not share in her sins </p><p class="indent"> or contract any of her plagues.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>For her sins are piled up to heaven, </p><p class="indent"> and God has remembered her iniquities.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Give back to her as she has done to others; </p><p class="indent"> pay her back double for what she has done; </p><p class="indent"> mix her a double portion in her own cup.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>As much as she has glorified herself and lived in luxury, </p><p class="indent"> give her the same measure of torment and grief. </p><p class="indent1"> In her heart she says, ‘I sit as queen; </p><p class="indent"> I am not a widow and will never see grief.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore her plagues will come in one day—</p><p class="indent"> death and grief and famine—</p><p class="indent1"> and she will be consumed by fire, </p><p class="indent"> for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.”
</p><p class="hdg">Lament over Babylon</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail at the sight of the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">10</span>In fear of her torment, they will stand at a distance and cry out: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Woe, woe to the great city, </p><p class="indent"> the mighty city of Babylon! </p><p class="indent1"> For in a single hour </p><p class="indent"> your judgment has come.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, because there is no one left to buy their cargo—
<span class="reftext">12</span>cargo of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; of fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet; of all kinds of citron wood and every article of ivory, precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble;
<span class="reftext">13</span>of cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, and frankincense; of wine, olive oil, fine flour, and wheat; of cattle, sheep, horses, and chariots; of slaves and souls of men.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And they will say:<span class="fn">f</span>  </p><p class="indent1stline">“The fruit of your soul’s desire </p><p class="indent"> has departed from you; </p><p class="indent1"> all your luxury and splendour have vanished, </p><p class="indent"> never to be seen again.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The merchants who sold these things and grew their wealth from her will stand at a distance, in fear of her torment. They will weep and mourn,
<span class="reftext">16</span>saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Woe, woe to the great city, </p><p class="indent"> clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, </p><p class="indent"> adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>For in a single hour </p><p class="indent"> such fabulous wealth has been destroyed!” </p><p class="reg1"> Every shipmaster, passenger, and sailor, and all who make their living from the sea, will stand at a distance
<span class="reftext">18</span>and cry out at the sight of the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her. “What city was ever like this great city?” they will exclaim.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then they will throw dust on their heads as they weep and mourn and cry out: </p><p class="indent1stline">“Woe, woe to the great city, </p><p class="indent"> where all who had ships on the sea </p><p class="indent"> were enriched by her wealth! </p><p class="indent1"> For in a single hour </p><p class="indent"> she has been destroyed.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">20</span>Rejoice over her, O heaven, </p><p class="indent"> O saints and apostles and prophets, </p><p class="indent1"> because God has pronounced for you </p><p class="indent"> His judgment against her.
</p><p class="hdg">The Doom of Babylon</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then a mighty angel picked up a stone the size of a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying: </p><p class="indent1stline">“With such violence </p><p class="indent"> the great city of Babylon will be cast down, </p><p class="indent"> never to be seen again.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>And the sound of harpists and musicians, </p><p class="indent"> of flute players and trumpeters, </p><p class="indent"> will never ring out in you again. </p><p class="indent1"> Nor will any craftsmen of any trade </p><p class="indent"> be found in you again, </p><p class="indent1"> nor the sound of a millstone </p><p class="indent"> be heard in you again.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>The light of a lamp </p><p class="indent"> will never shine in you again, </p><p class="indent1"> and the voices of a bride and bridegroom </p><p class="indent"> will never call out in you again. </p><p class="indent1"> For your merchants were the great ones of the earth, </p><p class="indent"> because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>And there was found in her the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who had been slain on the earth.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> See Isaiah 21:9 and Revelation 14:8.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> NE, WH, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">a haunt for every unclean spirit and every unclean and detestable bird.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> SBL and WH <i class="calibre6">have fallen by</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> See Jeremiah 51:45.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">9</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">when they see the smoke of her burning</i>; also in verse 18<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">And:</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
