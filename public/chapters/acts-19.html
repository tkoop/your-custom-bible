<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Holy Spirit Received at Ephesus</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed
through the interior and came to Ephesus. There he found some
disciples and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you
became believers?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">No,” they answered, “we have not
even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Into what, then, were you baptized?”
Paul asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">The baptism of John,” they replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Paul explained: “John’s baptism was a
baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the One
coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On hearing this, they were baptized into
the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul laid his hands on them, the
Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
There were about twelve men in all. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Paul went into the synagogue and
spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the
kingdom of God. But when some of them stubbornly refused to believe
and publicly maligned the Way, Paul took his disciples and left the
synagogue to conduct daily discussions in the lecture hall of
Tyrannus. This continued for two years, so that everyone who lived in
the province of Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the word of the
Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">God did extraordinary miracles through the
hands of Paul, so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched
him were taken to the sick, and the diseases and evil spirits left
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now there were some itinerant Jewish
exorcists who tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those
with evil spirits. They would say, “I bind you by Jesus, whom Paul
proclaims.” Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing
this. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Eventually, one of the evil spirits
answered them, “Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are
you?” Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them and
overpowered them all. The attack was so violent that they ran out of
the house naked and wounded. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This became known to all the Jews and
Greeks living in Ephesus, and fear came over all of them. So the name
of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. Many who had believed now
came forward, confessing and disclosing their deeds. And a number of
those who had practiced magic arts brought their books and burned
them in front of everyone. When the value of the books was
calculated, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. So the word of
the Lord powerfully continued to spread and prevail. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After these things had happened, Paul
resolved in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through
Macedonia and Achaia. “After I have been there,” he said, “I
must see Rome as well.” He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and
Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed for a time in the province of
Asia. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">About that time there arose a great
disturbance about the Way. It began with a silversmith named
Demetrius who made silver shrines of Artemis, bringing much business
to the craftsmen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Demetrius assembled the craftsmen, along
with the workmen in related trades. “Men,” he said, “you know
that this business is our source of prosperity. And you can see and
hear that not only in Ephesus, but in nearly the whole province of
Asia, Paul has persuaded a great number of people to turn away. He
says that man-made gods are no gods at all. There is danger not only
that our business will fall into disrepute, but also that the temple
of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited and her majesty
deposed—she who is worshiped by all the province of Asia and the
whole world.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the men heard this, they were enraged
and began shouting, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” Soon the
whole city was in disarray. They rushed together into the theatre,
dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling
companions from Macedonia. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Paul wanted to go before the assembly, but
the disciples would not allow him. Even some of Paul’s friends who
were officials of the province of Asia sent word to him, begging him
not to venture into the theatre. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile the assembly was in turmoil.
Some were shouting one thing and some another, and most of them did
not even know why they were there. The Jews in the crowd pushed
Alexander forward to explain himself, and he motioned for silence so
he could make his defense to the people. But when they realized that
he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great
is Artemis of the Ephesians!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Finally the city clerk quieted the crowd
and declared, “Men of Ephesus, doesn’t everyone know that the
city of Ephesus is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of
her image, which fell from heaven? Since these things are undeniable,
you ought to be calm and not do anything rash. For you have brought
these men here, though they have neither robbed our temple nor
blasphemed our goddess. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen
have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open and proconsuls
are available. Let them bring charges against one another there. But
if you are seeking anything beyond this, it must be settled in a
legal assembly. For we are in jeopardy of being charged with rioting
for today’s events, and we have no justification to account for
this commotion.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After he had said this, he dismissed the
assembly. </font>
