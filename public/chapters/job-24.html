</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Men move boundary stones; </p><p class="indent"> they pasture stolen flocks.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>They drive away the donkey of the fatherless </p><p class="indent"> and take the widow’s ox in pledge.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>They push the needy off the road </p><p class="indent"> and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert, </p><p class="indent"> the poor go to work foraging for food; </p><p class="indent"> the wasteland is food for their children.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>They gather fodder in the fields </p><p class="indent"> and glean the vineyards of the wicked.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Without clothing, they spend the night naked; </p><p class="indent"> they have no covering against the cold.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Drenched by mountain rains, </p><p class="indent"> they huddle against the rocks for want of shelter.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">9</span>The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast; </p><p class="indent"> the nursing child of the poor is seized for a debt.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Without clothing, they wander about naked. </p><p class="indent"> They carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>They crush olives within their walls; </p><p class="indent"> they tread the winepresses, but go thirsty.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>From the city, men groan, </p><p class="indent"> and the souls of the wounded cry out, </p><p class="indent"> yet God charges no one with wrongdoing.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then there are those who rebel against the light, </p><p class="indent"> not knowing its ways or staying on its paths.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When daylight is gone, the murderer rises </p><p class="indent"> to kill the poor and needy; </p><p class="indent"> in the night he is like a thief.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight. </p><p class="indent"> Thinking, ‘No eye will see me,’ he covers his face.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">16</span>In the dark they dig through houses; </p><p class="indent"> by day they shut themselves in, </p><p class="indent"> never to experience the light.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>For to them, deep darkness is their morning; </p><p class="indent"> surely they are friends with the terrors of darkness!
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>They are but foam on the surface of the water; </p><p class="indent"> their portion of the land is cursed, </p><p class="indent"> so that no one turns toward their vineyards.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>As drought and heat consume the melting snow, </p><p class="indent"> so Sheol steals those who have sinned.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>The womb forgets them; </p><p class="indent"> the worm feeds on them; </p><p class="indent1"> they are remembered no more. </p><p class="indent"> So injustice is like a broken tree.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>They prey on the barren and childless, </p><p class="indent"> and show no kindness to the widow.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">22</span>Yet by <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> power, God drags away the mighty; </p><p class="indent"> though rising up, they have no assurance of life.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>He gives them a sense of security, </p><p class="indent"> but <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> eyes are on their ways.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>They are exalted for a moment, </p><p class="indent"> then they are gone; </p><p class="indent1"> they are brought low and gathered up like all others; </p><p class="indent"> they are cut off like heads of grain.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>If this is not so, then who can prove me a liar </p><p class="indent"> and reduce my words to nothing?”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
