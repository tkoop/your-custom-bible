26</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Paul’s Testimony to Agrippa</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Agrippa said to Paul, “You have
permission to speak for yourself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Paul stretched out his hand and began
his defense: “King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand
before you today to defend myself against all the accusations of the
Jews, especially since you are acquainted with all the Jewish customs
and controversies. I beg you, therefore, to listen to me patiently. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Surely all the Jews know how I have lived
from the earliest days of my youth, among my own people and in
Jerusalem. They have known me for a long time and can testify, if
they are willing, that I lived as a Pharisee, adhering to the
strictest sect of our religion. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And now I stand on trial because of my
hope in the promise that God made to our fathers, the promise our
twelve tribes are hoping to realize as they earnestly serve God day
and night. It is because of this hope, O king, that I am accused by
the Jews. Why would any of you consider it incredible that God raises
the dead? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So then, I too was convinced that I ought
to do all I could to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. And that
is what I did in Jerusalem. With authority from the chief priests I
put many of the saints in prison, and when they were condemned to
death, I cast my vote against them. I frequently had them punished in
the synagogues, and I tried to make them blaspheme. In my raging fury
against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In this pursuit I was on my way to
Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.
About noon, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven,
brighter than the sun, shining around me and my companions. We all
fell to the ground, and I heard a voice say to me in Hebrew, <font color="#a80000">‘Saul,
Saul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the
goads.’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">Who are You, Lord?’ I asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am Jesus, whom
you are persecuting,’</font> the Lord replied. <font color="#a80000">‘But
get up and stand on your feet. For I have appeared to you to appoint
you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen from Me and
what I will show you. I will rescue you from your own people and from
the Gentiles. I am sending you to them to open their eyes, so that
they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to
God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance
among those sanctified by faith in Me.’</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So then, King Agrippa, I was not
disobedient to the heavenly vision. First to those in Damascus and
Jerusalem, then to everyone in the region of Judea, and then to the
Gentiles, I declared that they should repent and turn to God,
performing deeds worthy of their repentance. For this reason the Jews
seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But I have had God’s help to this day,
and I stand here to testify to small and great alike. I am saying
nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen: that
the Christ would suffer, and as the first to rise from the dead,
would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At this stage of Paul’s defense, Festus
exclaimed in a loud voice, “You are insane, Paul! Your great
learning is driving you to madness!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Paul answered, “I am not insane,
most excellent Festus; I am speaking words of truth and sobriety. For
the king knows about these matters, and I can speak freely to him. I
am confident that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was
not done in a corner. King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I
know you do.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Agrippa said to Paul, “Can you
persuade me in such a short time to become a Christian?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Short time or long,” Paul replied, “I
wish to God that not only you but all who hear me this day may become
what I am, except for these chains.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the king and the governor rose, along
with Bernice and those seated with them. On their way out, they said
to one another, “This man has done nothing worthy of death or
imprisonment.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man
could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.” </font>
