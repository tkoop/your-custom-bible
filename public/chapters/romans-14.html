<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Law of Liberty<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 7:1–6; Luke 6:37–42)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> on his opinions.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For one person has faith to eat all things, while another, who is weak, eats only vegetables.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The one who eats everything must not belittle the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted him.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>One person regards a certain day above the others, while someone else considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.
<span class="reftext">6</span>He who observes a special day does so to the Lord;<span class="fn">b</span>  he who eats does so to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>For none of us lives to himself alone, and none of us dies to himself alone.
<span class="reftext">8</span>If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
<span class="reftext">9</span>For this reason Christ died and returned to life, that He might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Why, then, do you judge your brother? Or why do you belittle your brother? For we will all stand before God’s <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> seat.
<span class="reftext">11</span>It is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">“As surely as I live, </p><p class="indent"> says the Lord, </p><p class="indent1"> every knee will bow before Me; </p><p class="indent"> every tongue will confess to God.”<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.
</p><p class="hdg">The Law of Love<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Ezekiel 14:1–11; 1 Corinthians 8:1–13)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore let us stop judging one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother’s way.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I am convinced and fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.
<span class="reftext">15</span>If your brother is distressed by what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother, for whom Christ died.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Do not allow what you consider good, then, to be spoken of as evil.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For whoever serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>So then, let us pursue what leads to peace and to mutual edification.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to let his eating be a stumbling block.
<span class="reftext">21</span>It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything to cause your brother to stumble.<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Keep your belief about such matters between yourself and God.<span class="fn">e</span>  Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.
<span class="reftext">23</span>But the one who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that is not from faith is sin.<span class="fn">f</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">without quarreling over disputable matters</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">he who does not regard the day, to the Lord he does not regard it;</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">will give praise to God</i> or <i class="calibre6">will acknowledge God</i>; Isaiah 45:23 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">21</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> SBL, BYZ, and TR include <i class="calibre6">or to be hindered or weakened</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Keep the faith that you have to yourself before God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Some manuscripts place the text of Romans 16:25–27 here.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
