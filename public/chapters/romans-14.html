<font><font face="Tahoma, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt"><b>Romans
14</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Law of Liberty</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Accept him whose faith is weak, without
passing judgment on his opinions. For one person has faith to eat all
things, while another, who is weak, eats only vegetables. The one who
eats everything must not belittle the one who does not, and the one
who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God
has accepted him. Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To
his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is
able to make him stand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">One person regards a certain day above the
others, while someone else considers every day alike. Each one should
be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes a special day
does so to the Lord; he who eats does so to the Lord, for he gives
thanks to God; and he who abstains does so to the Lord and gives
thanks to God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For none of us lives to himself alone, and
none of us dies to himself alone. If we live, we live to the Lord,
and if we die, we die to the Lord. So whether we live or die, we
belong to the Lord. For this reason Christ died and returned to life,
that He might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Why, then, do you judge your brother? Or
why do you belittle your brother? For we will all stand before God’s
judgment seat. It is written: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">As surely as I live, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">says the Lord, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">every knee will bow before Me; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">every tongue will confess to God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So then, each of us will give an account
of himself to God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore let us stop judging one another.
Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle
in your brother’s way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I am convinced and fully persuaded in the
Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards
something as unclean, then for him it is unclean. If your brother is
distressed by what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not
by your eating destroy your brother, for whom Christ died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do not allow what you consider good, then,
to be spoken of as evil. For the kingdom of God is not a matter of
eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy
Spirit. For whoever serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and
approved by men. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So then, let us pursue what leads to peace
and to mutual edification. Do not destroy the work of God for the
sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to let his
eating be a stumbling block. It is better not to eat meat or drink
wine or to do anything to cause your brother to stumble. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Keep your belief about such matters
between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn
himself by what he approves. But the one who has doubts is condemned
if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that
is not from faith is sin. </font>
