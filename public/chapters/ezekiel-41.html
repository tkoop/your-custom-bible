<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the man brought me into the outer
sanctuary and measured the side pillars to be six cubits wide on each
side. The width of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sides of the
entrance were five cubits on each side. He also measured the length
of the outer sanctuary to be forty cubits, and the width to be twenty
cubits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And he went into the inner sanctuary and
measured the side pillars at the entrance to be two cubits wide. The
entrance was six cubits wide, and the walls on each side were seven
cubits wide. Then he measured the room adjacent to the inner
sanctuary to be twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. And he
said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Next he measured the wall of the temple to
be six cubits thick, and the width of each side room around the
temple was four cubits. The side rooms were arranged one above
another in three levels of thirty rooms each. There were ledges all
around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side
rooms, so that the supports would not be fastened into the wall of
the temple itself. The side rooms surrounding the temple widened at
each successive level, because the structure surrounding the temple
ascended by stages corresponding to the narrowing of the temple wall
as it rose upward. And so a stairway went up from the lowest story to
the highest, through the middle one. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I saw that the temple had a raised base
all around it, forming the foundation of the side rooms. It was the
full length of a rod, six long cubits. The outer wall of the side
rooms was five cubits thick, and the open area between the side rooms
of the temple and the outer chambers was twenty cubits wide all
around the temple. The side rooms opened into this area, with one
entrance on the north and another on the south. The open area was
five cubits wide all around. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the building that faced the temple
courtyard on the west was seventy cubits wide, and the wall of the
building was five cubits thick all around, with a length of ninety
cubits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then he measured the temple to be a
hundred cubits long, and the temple courtyard and the building with
its walls were also a hundred cubits long. The width of the temple
courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a
hundred cubits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Next he measured the length of the
building facing the temple courtyard at the rear of the temple,
including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits. The
outer sanctuary, the inner sanctuary, and the porticoes facing the
court, as well as the thresholds and the beveled windows and the
galleries all around with their three levels opposite the threshold,
were overlaid with wood on all sides. They were paneled from the
ground to the windows, and the windows were covered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In the space above the outside of the
entrance to the inner sanctuary on all the walls, spaced evenly
around the inner and outer sanctuary, were alternating carved
cherubim and palm trees. Each cherub had two faces: the face of a man
was toward the palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion
was toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved all the
way around the temple. Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the
wall of the outer sanctuary from the floor to the space above the
entrance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The outer sanctuary had a rectangular
doorframe, and the doorframe of the sanctuary was similar. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">There was an altar of wood three cubits
high and two cubits square. Its corners, base, and sides were of
wood. And the man told me, “This is the table that is before the
LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Both the outer sanctuary and the inner
sanctuary had double doors, and each door had two swinging panels.
There were two panels for one door and two for the other. Cherubim
and palm trees like those on the walls were carved on the doors of
the outer sanctuary, and there was a wooden canopy outside, on the
front of the portico. There were beveled windows and palm trees on
the sidewalls of the portico. The side rooms of the temple also had
canopies. </font>
