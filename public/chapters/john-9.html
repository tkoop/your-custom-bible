9</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Spiritual Blindness</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now as Jesus was passing by, He saw a man
blind from birth, and His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned,
this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jesus answered, <font color="#a80000">“Neither
this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works
of God would be displayed in him. While it is daytime, we must do the
works of Him who sent Me. Night is coming, when no one can work.
While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jesus had said this, He spit on the
ground, made some mud, and applied it to the man’s eyes. Then He
told him, <font color="#a80000">“Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam”</font>
(which means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came back
seeing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At this, his neighbors and those who had
formerly seen him begging began to ask, “Isn’t this the man who
used to sit and beg?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Some claimed that he was, but others said,
“No, he just looks like him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But the man kept saying, “I am the one.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">How then were your eyes opened?” they
asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He answered, “The man they call Jesus
made some mud and anointed my eyes, and He told me to go to Siloam
and wash. So I went and washed and received my sight.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Where is He?” they asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I do not know,” he answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They brought to the Pharisees the man who
had been blind. Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and
opened his eyes was a Sabbath. So the Pharisees also asked him how he
had received his sight. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The man answered, “He put mud on my
eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Because of this, some of the Pharisees
said, “This man is not from God, for He does not keep the Sabbath.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But others said, “How can a sinful man
perform such signs?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And there was division among them. So once
again they asked the man who had been blind, “What do you say about
Him, since it was your eyes He opened?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">He is a prophet,” the man replied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Jews still did not believe that the
man had been blind and had received his sight until they summoned his
parents and asked, “Is this your son, the one you say was born
blind? So how is it that he can now see?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">His parents answered, “We know he is our
son, and we know he was born blind. But how he can now see or who
opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is old enough to speak
for himself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">His parents said this because they were
afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already determined that anyone
who confessed Jesus as the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.
That was why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So a second time they called for the man
who had been blind and said, “Give glory to God! We know that this
man is a sinner.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He answered, “Whether He is a sinner I
do not know. There is one thing I do know: I was blind, but now I
see!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">What did He do to you?” they asked.
“How did He open your eyes?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He replied, “I already told you, and you
did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to
become His disciples?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they heaped insults on him and said,
“You are His disciple; we are disciples of Moses. We know that God
spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">That is remarkable indeed!” the man
said. “You do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes.
We know that God does not listen to sinners, but He does listen to
the one who worships Him and does His will. Never before has anyone
heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. If this man were not
from God, He could do no such thing.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They replied, “You were born in utter
sin, and you are instructing us?” And they threw him out. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jesus heard that they had thrown him
out, He found the man and said, <font color="#a80000">“Do you
believe in the Son of Man?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Who is He, Sir?” he replied. “Tell
me so that I may believe in Him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">You have already
seen Him,”</font> Jesus answered. <font color="#a80000">“He is
the One speaking with you.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Lord, I believe,” he said. And he
worshiped Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus declared, <font color="#a80000">“For
judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind may see and
those who see may become blind.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Some of the Pharisees who were with Him
heard this, and they asked Him, “Are we blind too?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">If you were
blind,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“you would
not be guilty of sin. But since you claim you can see, your guilt
remains.”</font> </font>
