<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals the Man Born Blind</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now as Jesus was passing by, He saw a man blind from birth,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a><span class="reftext">2</span>and His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Jesus answered, <span>“Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God would be displayed in him.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a><span class="reftext">4</span>While it is daytime, we must do<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">a</a></span>  the works of Him who sent Me. Night is coming, when no one can work.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a><span class="reftext">5</span>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>When Jesus had said this, He spit on the ground, made some mud, and applied it to the man’s eyes.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a><span class="reftext">7</span>Then He told him, <span>“Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam”</span> (which means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came back seeing.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>At this, his neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging began to ask, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Some claimed that he was, but others said, “No, he just looks like him.” </p><p class="reg1"> But the man kept saying, “I am the one.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>“How then were your eyes opened?” they asked.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>He answered, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and anointed my eyes, and He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and received my sight.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>“Where is He?” they asked. </p><p class="reg1">“I do not know,” he answered.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a></p><p class="hdg">The Pharisees Investigate the Healing</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a><span class="reftext">14</span>Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened his eyes was a Sabbath.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a><span class="reftext">15</span>So the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. </p><p class="reg1"> The man answered, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Because of this, some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for He does not keep the Sabbath.” </p><p class="reg1"> But others said, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” </p><p class="reg1"> And there was division among them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a><span class="reftext">17</span>So once again they asked the man who had been blind, “What do you say about Him, since it was your eyes He opened?” </p><p class="reg1">“He is a prophet,” the man replied.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>The Jews still did not believe that the man had been blind and had received his sight until they summoned his parents
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a><span class="reftext">19</span>and asked, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? So how is it that he can now see?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>His parents answered, “We know he is our son, and we know he was born blind.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="21"></a><span class="reftext">21</span>But how he can now see or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already determined that anyone who confessed Jesus as the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="23"></a><span class="reftext">23</span>That was why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="24"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So a second time they called for the man who had been blind and said, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>He answered, “Whether He is a sinner I do not know. There is one thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see!”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="26"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>“What did He do to you?” they asked. “How did He open your eyes?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="27"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>He replied, “I already told you, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become His disciples?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="28"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then they heaped insults on him and said, “You are His disciple; we are disciples of Moses.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="29"></a><span class="reftext">29</span>We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="30"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>“That is remarkable indeed!” the man said. “You do not know where He is from, and yet He opened my eyes.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="31"></a><span class="reftext">31</span>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but He does listen to the one who worships Him and does His will.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="32"></a><span class="reftext">32</span>Never before has anyone heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="33"></a><span class="reftext">33</span>If this man were not from God, He could do no such thing.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="34"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>They replied, “You were born in utter sin, and you are instructing us?” And they threw him out.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="35"></a></p><p class="hdg">Spiritual Blindness</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, He found the man and said, <span>“Do you believe in the Son of Man<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">b</a></span>?”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="36"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">36</span>“Who is He, Sir?” he replied. “Tell me so that I may believe in Him.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="37"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span><span>“You have already seen Him,”</span> Jesus answered. <span>“He is the One speaking with you.”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="38"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>“Lord, I believe,” he said. And he worshiped Jesus.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="39"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>Then Jesus declared, <span>“For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind may see and those who see may become blind.”</span><span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">c</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="40"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard this, and they asked Him, “Are we blind too?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="41"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">41</span>“If you were blind,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“you would not be guilty of sin. But since you claim you can see, your guilt remains.”</span></p></div><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">I must do</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">the Son of God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">39</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">so that those not seeing may see and those seeing may become blind.</i> Some manuscripts do not include <i class="calibre6"><span class="fnv">38</span>“Lord, I believe.”... <span class="fnv">39</span>Then Jesus declared</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
