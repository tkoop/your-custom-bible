<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">These are the nations that the LORD left
to test all the Israelites who had not known any of the wars in
Canaan, if only to teach warfare to the subsequent generations of
Israel, especially to those who had not known it formerly: the five
rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the
Hivites who lived in the mountains of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon
to Lebo-hamath. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">These nations were left to test the
Israelites, to find out whether they would keep the commandments of
the LORD, which He had given their fathers through Moses. Thus the
Israelites continued to live among the Canaanites, Hittites,
Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. And they took the
daughters of these people in marriage, gave their own daughters to
their sons, and served their gods. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the Israelites did evil in the sight of
the LORD; they forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the
Asherahs. Then the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He
sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram-naharaim,
and the Israelites served him eight years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But when the Israelites cried out to the
LORD, He raised up Othniel son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz as
a deliverer to save them. The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and
he became Israel’s judge and went out to war. And the LORD
delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Aram into the hand of Othniel,
who prevailed against him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the land had rest for forty years,
until Othniel son of Kenaz died. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Once again the Israelites did evil in the
sight of the LORD. So He gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel,
because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. After enlisting
the Ammonites and Amalekites to join forces with him, Eglon attacked
and defeated Israel, taking possession of the City of Palms. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Israelites served Eglon king of Moab
eighteen years. And again they cried out to the LORD, and He raised
up Ehud son of Gera, a left-handed Benjamite, as their deliverer. So
they sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Ehud had made for himself a
double-edged sword a cubit long. He strapped it to his right thigh
under his cloak and brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who
was an obese man. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After Ehud had finished presenting the
tribute, he ushered out those who had carried it. But upon reaching
the idols near Gilgal, he himself turned back and said, “I have a
secret message for you, O king.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Silence,” said the king, and all his
attendants left him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Ehud approached him while he was
sitting alone in the coolness of his upper room. “I have a word
from God for you,” Ehud said, and the king rose from his seat. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Ehud reached with his left hand,
pulled the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into Eglon’s
belly. Even the handle sank in after the blade, and Eglon’s fat
closed in over it, so that Ehud did not withdraw the sword from his
belly. And Eglon’s bowels emptied. Then Ehud went out through the
porch, closing and locking the doors of the upper room behind him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After Ehud was gone, Eglon’s servants
came in and found the doors of the upper room locked. “He must be
relieving himself in the cool room,” they said. So they waited
until they became worried and saw that he had still not opened the
doors of the upper room. Then they took the key and opened the
doors—and there was their lord lying dead on the floor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ehud, however, had escaped while the
servants waited. He passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On arriving in Seirah, he blew the ram’s
horn throughout the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites came down
with him from the hills, and he became their leader. “Follow me,”
he told them, “for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites
into your hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they followed him down and seized the
fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to
cross over. At that time they struck down about ten thousand
Moabites, all robust and valiant men. Not one of them escaped. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Moab was subdued under the hand of
Israel that day, and the land had rest for eighty years. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath. And
he too saved Israel, striking down six hundred Philistines with an
oxgoad. </font>
