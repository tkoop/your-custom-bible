<font ><b>Taming the Tongue</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Not many of you should become teachers, my
brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more
strictly. We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in
what he says, he is a perfect man, able to control his whole body. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When we put bits into the mouths of horses
to make them obey us, we can guide the whole animal. Consider ships
as well. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds,
they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot is
inclined. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the same way, the tongue is a small
part of the body, but it boasts of great things. Consider how small a
spark sets a great forest ablaze. The tongue also is a fire, a world
of wickedness among the parts of the body. It pollutes the whole
person, sets the course of his life on fire, and is itself set on
fire by hell. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and
creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man, but
no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly
poison. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >With the tongue we bless our Lord and
Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in Godâ€™s
likeness. Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My
brothers, this should not be! Can both fresh water and salt water
flow from the same spring? My brothers, can a fig tree grow olives,
or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh
water. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Who is wise and understanding among you?
Let him show it by his good conduct, by deeds done in the humility
that comes from wisdom. But if you harbor bitter jealousy and selfish
ambition in your hearts, do not boast in it or deny the truth. Such
wisdom does not come from above, but is earthly, unspiritual,
demonic. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be
disorder and every evil practice. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But the wisdom from above is first of all
pure, then peace-loving, gentle, accommodating, full of mercy and
good fruit, impartial, and sincere. Peacemakers who sow in peace reap
the fruit of righteousness. </font>
