<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Taming the Tongue<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 64:1–10)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.
<span class="reftext">2</span>We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to control his whole body.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can guide the whole animal.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Consider ships as well. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot is inclined.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it boasts of great things. Consider how small a spark sets a great forest ablaze.
<span class="reftext">6</span>The tongue also is a fire, a world of wickedness among the parts of the body. It pollutes the whole person, sets the course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man,
<span class="reftext">8</span>but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>With the tongue we bless our Lord and <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span>, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God’s likeness.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be!
<span class="reftext">11</span>Can both fresh water and salt water<span class="fn">b</span>  flow from the same spring?
<span class="reftext">12</span>My brothers, can a fig tree grow olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring<span class="fn">c</span>  produce fresh water.
</p><p class="hdg">The Wisdom from Above</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show it by his good conduct, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.
<span class="reftext">14</span>But if you <span class='spell ca'>harbour</span><span class='spell gb'>harbour</span><span class='spell us'>harbor</span> bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast in it or deny the truth.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Such wisdom does not come from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
<span class="reftext">16</span>For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every evil practice.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peace-loving, gentle, accommodating, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and sincere.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Peacemakers who sow in peace reap the fruit of righteousness.<span class="fn">d</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">Gehenna</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Can both fresh and bitter</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Neither can salt</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">But the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those making peace.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
