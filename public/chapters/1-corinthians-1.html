</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Grace and peace to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from God our <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span> and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span class="reftext">5</span>For in <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have been enriched in every way, in all speech and all knowledge,
<span class="reftext">6</span>because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not lack any spiritual gift as <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<span class="reftext">8</span>He will sustain <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to the end, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

</p><p class="hdg">Unity in the Church<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 133:1–3; Ephesians 4:1–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>I appeal to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> agree together, so that there may be no divisions among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may be united in mind and conviction.
<span class="reftext">11</span>My brothers, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">12</span>What I mean is this: Individuals among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are saying, “I follow Paul,” “I follow Apollos,” “I follow Cephas,”<span class="fn">a</span>  or “I follow Christ.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>? Were <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> baptized into the name of Paul?
<span class="reftext">14</span>I thank God that I did not <span class='spell ca'>baptize</span><span class='spell gb'>baptise</span><span class='spell us'>baptize</span> any of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> except Crispus and Gaius,
<span class="reftext">15</span>so no one can say that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were baptized into my name.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that I do not remember if I baptized anyone else.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For Christ did not send me to <span class='spell ca'>baptize</span><span class='spell gb'>baptise</span><span class='spell us'>baptize</span>, but to preach the gospel, not with words of wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
</p><p class="hdg">The Message of the Cross</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
<span class="reftext">19</span>For it is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; </p><p class="indent"> the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
<span class="reftext">21</span>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Jews demand signs and Greeks search for wisdom,
<span class="reftext">23</span>but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">24</span>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>For the foolishness of God is wiser than man’s wisdom,<span class="fn">d</span>  and the weakness of God is stronger than man’s strength.
</p><p class="hdg">Wisdom from God</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Brothers, consider the time of <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> calling: Not many of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> were wise by human standards; not many were powerful; not many were of noble birth.
<span class="reftext">27</span>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.
<span class="reftext">28</span>He chose the lowly and despised things of the world, and the things that are not, to nullify the things that are,
<span class="reftext">29</span>so that no one may boast in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> presence.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>It is because of <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God: our righteousness, holiness, and redemption.
<span class="reftext">31</span>Therefore, as it is written: “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”<span class="fn">e</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, Peter<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Isaiah 29:14 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">to Greeks</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">25</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">than men</i>; twice in this verse<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">31</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Jeremiah 9:24<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
