<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>The Message of the Cross</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ
Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes, </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">To the church of God in Corinth, to those
sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all
those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their
Lord and ours: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Grace and peace to you from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I always thank my God for you because of
the grace He has given you in Christ Jesus. For in Him you have been
enriched in every way, in all speech and all knowledge, because our
testimony about Christ was confirmed in you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Therefore you do not lack any spiritual
gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ. He
will sustain you to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day
of our Lord Jesus Christ. God, who has called you into fellowship
with His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree together, so that there
may be no divisions among you and that you may be united in mind and
conviction. My brothers, some from Chloe’s household have informed
me that there are quarrels among you. What I mean is this:
Individuals among you are saying, “I follow Paul,” “I follow
Apollos,” “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for
you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul? I thank God that I did
not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, so no one can say
that you were baptized into my name. Yes, I also baptized the
household of Stephanas; beyond that I do not remember if I baptized
anyone else. For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the
gospel, not with words of wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied
of its power. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the message of the cross is
foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved
it is the power of God. For it is written: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">the intelligence of the intelligent I will
frustrate.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Where is the wise man? Where is the
scribe? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made
foolish the wisdom of the world? For since in the wisdom of God the
world through its wisdom did not know Him, God was pleased through
the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Jews demand signs and Greeks search for
wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and
foolishness to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and
Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the foolishness of God is wiser than
man’s wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man’s
strength. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Brothers, consider the time of your
calling: Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were
powerful; not many were of noble birth. But God chose the foolish
things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of
the world to shame the strong. He chose the lowly and despised things
of the world, and the things that are not, to nullify the things that
are, so that no one may boast in His presence. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">It is because of Him that you are in
Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God: our
righteousness, holiness, and redemption. Therefore, as it is written:
“Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.” </font>
