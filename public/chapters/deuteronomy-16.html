<font >Observe the month of Abib and celebrate
the Passover to the LORD your God, because in the month of Abib the
LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are to offer to the LORD your God the
Passover sacrifice from the herd or flock in the place the LORD will
choose as a dwelling for His Name. You must not eat leavened bread
with it; for seven days you are to eat with it unleavened bread, the
bread of affliction, because you left the land of Egypt in haste—so
that you may remember for the rest of your life the day you left the
land of Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">

for seven days, and none of the meat you sacrifice in the evening of
the first day shall remain until morning. </font>

<font >You are not to sacrifice the Passover
animal in any of the towns that the LORD your God is giving you. You
must only offer the Passover sacrifice at the place the LORD your God
will choose as a dwelling for His Name. Do this in the evening as the
sun sets, at the same time you departed from Egypt. And you shall
roast it and eat it in the place the LORD your God will choose, and
in the morning you shall return to your tents. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">

bread, and on the seventh day you shall hold a solemn assembly to the
LORD your God, and you must not do any work. </font>

<font >You are to count off seven weeks from the
time you first put the sickle to the standing grain. And you shall
celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the LORD your God with a freewill
offering that you give in proportion to how the LORD your God has
blessed you, and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in the
place He will choose as a dwelling for His Name—you, your sons and
daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levite within
your gates, as well as the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widows
among you. </font>

Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of
your threshing floor and your winepress. And you shall rejoice in
your feast—you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and

fatherless, and the widows among you. </font>

your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of
your hands, so that your joy will be complete. </font>

<font >Three times a year all your men are to
appear before the LORD your God in the place He will choose: at the
Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of
Tabernacles. No one should appear before the LORD empty-handed.
Everyone must appear with a gift as he is able, according to the
blessing the LORD your God has given you. </font>

for yourselves a sacred pillar, which the LORD your God hates. </font>
