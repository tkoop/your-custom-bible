<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now you, son of man, take a brick,
place it before you, and draw on it the city of Jerusalem. Then lay
siege against it: Construct a siege wall, build a ramp to it, set up
camps against it, and place battering rams around it on all sides.
Then take an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between
yourself and the city. Turn your face toward it so that it is under
siege, and besiege it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then lie down on your left side and place
the iniquity of the house of Israel upon yourself. You are to bear
their iniquity for the number of days you lie on your side. For I
have assigned to you 390 days, according to the number of years of
their iniquity. So you shall bear the iniquity of the house of
Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When you have completed these days, lie
down again, but on your right side, and bear the iniquity of the
house of Judah. I have assigned to you 40 days, a day for each year.
You must turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm
bared, and prophesy against it. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now behold, I will tie you up with ropes
so you cannot turn from side to side until you have finished the days
of your siege. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But take wheat, barley, beans, lentils,
millet, and spelt; put them in a single container and make them into
bread for yourself. This is what you are to eat during the 390 days
you lie on your side. You are to weigh out twenty shekels of food to
eat each day, and you are to eat it at set times. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You are also to measure out a sixth of a
hin of water to drink, and you are to drink it at set times. And you
shall eat the food as you would a barley cake, after you bake it over
dried human excrement in the sight of the people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said, “This is how the
Israelites will eat their defiled bread among the nations to which I
will banish them.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ah, Lord GOD,” I said, “I have
never defiled myself. From my youth until now I have not eaten
anything found dead or mauled by wild beasts. No unclean meat has
ever entered my mouth.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Look,” He replied, “I will let you
use cow dung instead of human excrement, and you may bake your bread
over that.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then He told me, “Son of man, I am going
to cut off the supply of food in Jerusalem. They will anxiously eat
bread rationed by weight, and in despair they will drink water by
measure. So they will lack food and water; they will be appalled at
the sight of one another wasting away in their iniquity. </font>
