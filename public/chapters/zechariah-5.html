<font ><b>The Flying Scroll and the Woman in a
Basket</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Again I lifted up my eyes and saw before
me a flying scroll. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What do you see?” asked the angel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >I see a flying scroll,” I replied,
“twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he told me, “This is the curse that
is going out over the face of all the land, for according to one side
of the scroll, every thief will be removed; and according to the
other side, every perjurer will be removed. I will send it out,
declares the LORD of Hosts, and it will enter the house of the thief
and the house of him who swears falsely by My name. It will remain
inside his house and destroy it, down to its timbers and stones.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the angel who was speaking with me
came forward and told me, “Now lift up your eyes and see what is
approaching.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >What is it?” I asked. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And he replied, “A measuring basket is
going forth.” Then he continued, “This is their iniquity in all
the land.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And behold, the cover of lead was raised,
and there was a woman sitting inside the basket. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >This is Wickedness,” he said. And he
shoved her down into the basket, pushing down the lead cover over its
opening. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I lifted up my eyes and saw two women
approaching, with the wind in their wings. Their wings were like
those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and
earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Where are they taking the basket?” I
asked the angel who was speaking with me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >To build a house for it in the land of
Shinar,” he told me. “And when it is ready, the basket will be
set there on its pedestal.” </font>
