</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then he told me, “This is the curse that is going out over the face of all the land, for according to one side of the scroll, every thief will be removed; and according to the other side, every perjurer will be removed.
<span class="reftext">4</span>I will send it out, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of him who swears falsely by <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> name.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then I lifted up my eyes and saw two women approaching, with the wind in their wings. Their wings were like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between <span class='nocap'>Heaven</span><span class='cap'>heaven</span><span class='bsb'>heaven</span> and <span class='nocap'>Earth</span><span class='cap'>Earth</span><span class='bsb'>earth</span>.
