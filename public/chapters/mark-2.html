And when the people heard that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was home,
<span class="reftext">2</span>they gathered in such large numbers that there was no more room, not even outside the door, as Jesus spoke the word to them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then a paralytic was brought to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, carried by four men.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Since they were unable to get to Jesus through the crowd, they uncovered the roof above <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, made an opening, and lowered the paralytic on his mat.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When Jesus saw their faith, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> said to the paralytic, <span>“Son, your sins are forgiven.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>But some of the scribes were sitting there and thinking in their hearts,
<span class="reftext">7</span>“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>At once Jesus knew in <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> spirit that they were thinking this way within themselves. <span>“Why are <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> thinking these things in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> hearts?”</span> He asked.
<span><span class="reftext">9</span>“Which is easier: to say to a paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk’?
<span class="reftext">10</span>But so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may know that the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span> of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...”</span> He said to the paralytic,
<span><span class="reftext">11</span>“I tell you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>And immediately the man got up, picked up his mat, and walked out in front of them all. As a result, they were all astounded and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Calls Levi<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 9:9–13; Luke 5:27–32)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Once again Jesus went out beside the sea. All the people came to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> taught them there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>As <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> was walking along, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth. <span>“Follow <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>,”</span> <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> told him, and Levi got up and followed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>While Jesus was dining at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples—for there were many who followed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.
<span class="reftext">16</span>When the scribes who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with these people, they asked <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples, “Why does <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> eat<span class="fn">a</span>  with tax collectors and sinners?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>On hearing this, Jesus told them, <span>“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</span>

So people came to Jesus and asked, “Why don’t <span class='youpl' data-word='Your'>Your</span>n class='cap'>Your</span><span class='nocap'>your</span> disciples fast like John’s disciples and those of the Pharisees?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Jesus replied, <span>“How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is with them? As long as <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is with them, they cannot fast.
<span class="reftext">20</span>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.</span>

If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, and a worse tear will result.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">22</span>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Lord of the Sabbath<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Samuel 21:1–7; Matthew 12:1–8; Luke 6:1–5)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>One Sabbath Jesus was passing through the grainfields, and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> disciples began to pick the heads of grain as they walked along.
<span class="reftext">24</span>So the Pharisees said to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>, “Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Have <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?
<span class="reftext">26</span>During the high priesthood of Abiathar, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread,<span class="fn">c</span>  which was lawful only for the priests. And he gave some to his companions as well.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Then Jesus declared, <span>“The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
<span class="reftext">28</span>Therefore, the <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span> of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”</span></p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">and drink</i>; see Luke 5:30.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Tischendorf does not include <i class="calibre6">Instead, new wine is poured into new wineskins</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Bread of the Presence</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
