<font ><b>The Lord of the Sabbath</b></font></p>

<font >A few days later Jesus went back to
Capernaum. And when the people heard that He was home, they gathered
in such large numbers that there was no more room, not even outside
the door, as Jesus spoke the word to them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a paralytic was brought to Him,
carried by four men. Since they were unable to get to Jesus through
the crowd, they uncovered the roof above Him, made an opening, and
lowered the paralytic on his mat. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the
paralytic, <font color="#a80000">“Son, your sins are forgiven.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But some of the scribes were sitting there
and thinking in their hearts, “Why does this man speak like this?
He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At once Jesus knew in His spirit that they
were thinking this way within themselves. <font color="#a80000">“Why
are you thinking these things in your hearts?”</font> He asked.
<font color="#a80000">“Which is easier: to say to a paralytic,
‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat,
and walk’? But so that you may know that the Son of Man has
authority on earth to forgive sins...”</font> He said to the
paralytic, <font color="#a80000">“I tell you, get up, pick up your
mat, and go home.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And immediately the man got up, picked up
his mat, and walked out in front of them all. As a result, they were
all astounded and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen
anything like this!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once again Jesus went out beside the sea.
All the people came to Him, and He taught them there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As He was walking along, He saw Levi son
of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth. <font color="#a80000">“Follow
Me,”</font> He told him, and Levi got up and followed Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Jesus was dining at Levi’s house,
many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Him and His
disciples—for there were many who followed Him. When the scribes
who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with these people, they asked His
disciples, “Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On hearing this, Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“It
is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come
to call the righteous, but sinners.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees
were often fasting. So people came to Jesus and asked, “Why don’t
Your disciples fast like John’s disciples and those of the
Pharisees?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“How
can the guests of the bridegroom fast while He is with them? As long
as He is with them, they cannot fast. But the time will come when the
bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >No one sews a patch
of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will
pull away from the old, and a worse tear will result. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >And no one pours new
wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins,
and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, new wine
is poured into new wineskins.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >One Sabbath Jesus was passing through the
grainfields, and His disciples began to pick the heads of grain as
they walked along. So the Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why are
they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Have
you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry
and in need? During the high priesthood of Abiathar, he entered the
house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which was lawful only for
the priests. And he gave some to his companions as well.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus declared, <font color="#a80000">“The
Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. Therefore, the Son
of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”</font> </font>
