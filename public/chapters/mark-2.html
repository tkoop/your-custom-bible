<font face="Tahoma, serif">A few days later Jesus went back to
Capernaum. And when the people heard that He was home, they gathered
in such large numbers that there was no more room, not even outside
the door, as Jesus spoke the word to them. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then a paralytic was brought to Him,
carried by four men. Since they were unable to get to Jesus through
the crowd, they uncovered the roof above Him, made an opening, and
lowered the paralytic on his mat. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the
paralytic, <font color="#a80000">“Son, your sins are forgiven.”</font>
</font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But some of the scribes were sitting there
and thinking in their hearts, “Why does this man speak like this?
He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">At once Jesus knew in His spirit that they
were thinking this way within themselves. <font color="#a80000">“Why
are you thinking these things in your hearts?”</font> He asked.
<font color="#a80000">“Which is easier: to say to a paralytic,
‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat,
and walk’? But so that you may know that the Son of Man has
authority on earth to forgive sins...”</font> He said to the
paralytic, <font color="#a80000">“I tell you, get up, pick up your
mat, and go home.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And immediately the man got up, picked up
his mat, and walked out in front of them all. As a result, they were
all astounded and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen
anything like this!” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">As He was walking along, He saw Levi son
of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth. <font color="#a80000">“Follow
Me,”</font> He told him, and Levi got up and followed Him. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">While Jesus was dining at Levi’s house,
many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Him and His
disciples—for there were many who followed Him. When the scribes
who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with these people, they asked His
disciples, “Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On hearing this, Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“It
is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come
to call the righteous, but sinners.”</font> </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees
were often fasting. So people came to Jesus and asked, “Why don’t
Your disciples fast like John’s disciples and those of the
Pharisees?” </font>

bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.</font> </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">One Sabbath Jesus was passing through the
grainfields, and His disciples began to pick the heads of grain as
they walked along. So the Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why are
they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?” </font>

the priests. And he gave some to his companions as well.”</font> </font>
