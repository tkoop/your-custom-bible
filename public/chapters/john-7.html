<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jesus Teaches at the Feast</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After this, Jesus <span class='spell ca'>travelled</span><span class='spell gb'>travelled</span><span class='spell us'>traveled</span> throughout Galilee. He did not want to travel in Judea, because the Jews there were trying to kill Him.
<span class="reftext">2</span>However, the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles<span class="fn">a</span>  was near.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So Jesus’ brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go to Judea, so that Your disciples there may see the works You are doing.
<span class="reftext">4</span>For no one who wants to be known publicly acts in secret. Since You are doing these things, show Yourself to the world.”
<span class="reftext">5</span>For even His own brothers did not believe in Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore Jesus told them, <span>“Although your time is always at hand, My time has not yet come.
<span class="reftext">7</span>The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify that its works are evil.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Go up to the feast on your own. I am not<span class="fn">b</span>  going up to this feast, because My time has not yet come.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Having said this, Jesus remained in Galilee.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But after His brothers had gone up to the feast, He also went—not publicly, but in secret.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>So the Jews were looking for Him at the feast and asking, “Where is He?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Many in the crowds were whispering about Him. Some said, “He is a good man.” </p><p class="reg1"> But others replied, “No, He deceives the people.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Yet no one would speak publicly about Him for fear of the Jews.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>About halfway through the feast, Jesus went up to the temple courts<span class="fn">c</span>  and began to teach.
<span class="reftext">15</span>The Jews were amazed and asked, “How did this man attain such learning without having studied?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">16</span>“My teaching is not My own,”</span> Jesus replied. <span>“It comes from Him who sent Me.
<span class="reftext">17</span>If anyone desires to do His will, he will know whether My teaching is from God or whether I speak on My own.
<span class="reftext">18</span>He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is a man of truth; in Him there is no falsehood.
<span class="reftext">19</span>Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps it. Why are you trying to kill Me?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>“You have a demon,” the crowd replied. “Who is trying to kill You?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Jesus answered them, <span>“I did one miracle, and you are all amazed.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But because Moses gave you circumcision, you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath (not that it is from Moses, but from the patriarchs.)
<span class="reftext">23</span>If a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses will not be broken, why are you angry with Me for making the whole man well on the Sabbath?
<span class="reftext">24</span>Stop judging by outward appearances, and start judging justly.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Is Jesus the Christ?</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then some of the people of Jerusalem began to say, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill?
<span class="reftext">26</span>Yet here He is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying anything to Him. Have the rulers truly <span class='spell ca'>recognized</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognized</span> that this is the Christ?
<span class="reftext">27</span>But we know where this man is from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where He is from.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, <span>“You know Me, and you know where I am from. I have not come of My own accord, but He who sent Me is true. You do not know Him,
<span class="reftext">29</span>but I know Him, because I am from Him and He sent Me.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>So they tried to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
<span class="reftext">31</span>Many in the crowd, however, believed in Him and said, “When the Christ comes, will He perform more signs than this man?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>When the Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus, they and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him.
<span class="reftext">33</span>So Jesus said, <span>“I am with you only a little while longer, and then I am going to the One who sent Me.
<span class="reftext">34</span>You will look for Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>At this, the Jews said to one another, “Where does He intend to go that we will not find Him? Will He go where the Jews are dispersed among the Greeks,<span class="fn">d</span>  and teach the Greeks?
<span class="reftext">36</span>What does He mean by saying, <span>‘You will look for Me, but you will not find Me,’</span> and, <span>‘Where I am, you cannot come’</span>?”
</p><p class="hdg">Living Water</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and called out in a loud voice, <span>“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink.
<span class="reftext">38</span>Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said: ‘Streams of living water will flow from within him.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</span>
<span class="reftext">39</span>He was speaking about the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were later to receive. For the Spirit had not yet been given,<span class="fn">e</span>  because Jesus had not yet been glorified.
</p><p class="hdg">Division over Jesus</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>On hearing these words, some of the people said, “This is truly the Prophet.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>Others declared, “This is the Christ.” </p><p class="reg1"> But still others asked, “How can the Christ come from Galilee?
<span class="reftext">42</span>Doesn’t the Scripture say that the Christ will come from the line of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?<span class="fn">f</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">43</span>So there was division in the crowd because of Jesus.
<span class="reftext">44</span>Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on Him.
</p><p class="hdg">The Unbelief of the Jewish Leaders</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">45</span>Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring Him in?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>“Never has anyone spoken like this man!” the officers answered.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>“Have you also been deceived?” replied the Pharisees.
<span class="reftext">48</span>“Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Him?
<span class="reftext">49</span>But this crowd that does not know the law, they are under a curse.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who himself was one of them, asked,
<span class="reftext">51</span>“Does our law convict a man without first hearing from him to determine what he has done?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">52</span>“Aren’t you also from Galilee?” they replied. “Look into it, and you will see that no prophet comes out of Galilee.”<span class="fn">g</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">53</span>Then each went to his own home.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, Sukkot, the autumn feast of pilgrimage to Jerusalem; also translated as <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Booths</i> or <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Shelters</i> and originally called <i class="calibre6">the Feast of Ingathering</i> (see Exodus 23:16 and Exodus 34:22).<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> NE, WH, BYZ, and TR <i class="calibre6">I am not yet</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i>; also in verse 28<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">35</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Will He go to the Diaspora among the Greeks</i>; the Jewish people living outside the land of Israel since the Babylonian exile were referred to as <i class="calibre6">the Diaspora</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">39</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the Spirit was not yet</i>; BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">the Holy Spirit was not yet</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">42</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> See Micah 5:2.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">52</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> Early manuscripts do not include John 7:53 through John 8:11.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
