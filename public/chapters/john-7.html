<font >After this, Jesus traveled throughout
Galilee. He did not want to travel in Judea, because the Jews there
were trying to kill Him. However, the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was
near. So Jesus’ brothers said to Him, “Leave here and go to
Judea, so that Your disciples there may see the works You are doing.
For no one who wants to be known publicly acts in secret. Since You
are doing these things, show Yourself to the world.” For even His
own brothers did not believe in Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore Jesus told them, <font color="#a80000">“Although
your time is always at hand, My time has not yet come. The world
cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify that its works
are evil. Go up to the feast on your own. I am not going up to this
feast, because My time has not yet come.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Having said this, Jesus remained in
Galilee. But after His brothers had gone up to the feast, He also
went—not publicly, but in secret. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the Jews were looking for Him at the
feast and asking, “Where is He?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Many in the crowds were whispering about
Him. Some said, “He is a good man.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But others replied, “No, He deceives the
people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Yet no one would speak publicly about Him
for fear of the Jews. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >About halfway through the feast, Jesus
went up to the temple courts and began to teach. The Jews were amazed
and asked, “How did this man attain such learning without having
studied?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >My teaching is
not My own,”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“It
comes from Him who sent Me. If anyone desires to do His will, he will
know whether My teaching is from God or whether I speak on My own. He
who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory, but He who seeks
the glory of the One who sent Him is a man of truth; in Him there is
no falsehood. Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you
keeps it. Why are you trying to kill Me?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >You have a demon,” the crowd replied.
“Who is trying to kill You?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus answered them, <font color="#a80000">“I
did one miracle, and you are all amazed. But because Moses gave you
circumcision, you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath (not that it is
from Moses, but from the patriarchs.) If a boy can be circumcised on
the Sabbath so that the law of Moses will not be broken, why are you
angry with Me for making the whole man well on the Sabbath? Stop
judging by outward appearances, and start judging justly.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then some of the people of Jerusalem began
to say, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill? Yet here He
is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying anything to Him. Have
the rulers truly recognized that this is the Christ? But we know
where this man is from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where
He is from.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple
courts, cried out, <font color="#a80000">“You know Me, and you know
where I am from. I have not come of My own accord, but He who sent Me
is true. You do not know Him, but I know Him, because I am from Him
and He sent Me.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they tried to seize Him, but no one
laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. Many in the
crowd, however, believed in Him and said, “When the Christ comes,
will He perform more signs than this man?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the Pharisees heard the crowd
whispering these things about Jesus, they and the chief priests sent
officers to arrest Him. So Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“I am
with you only a little while longer, and then I am going to the One
who sent Me. You will look for Me, but you will not find Me; and
where I am, you cannot come.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At this, the Jews said to one another,
“Where does He intend to go that we will not find Him? Will He go
where the Jews are dispersed among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
What does He mean by saying, <font color="#a80000">‘You will look
for Me, but you will not find Me,’</font> and, <font color="#a80000">‘Where
I am, you cannot come’</font>?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On the last and greatest day of the feast,
Jesus stood up and called out in a loud voice, <font color="#a80000">“If
anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. Whoever believes in
Me, as the Scripture has said: ‘Streams of living water will flow
from within him.’</font><font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"><font color="#880000"> </font></font><font color="#a80000">”</font>
He was speaking about the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were
later to receive. For the Spirit had not yet been given, because
Jesus had not yet been glorified. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On hearing these words, some of the people
said, “This is truly the Prophet.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Others declared, “This is the Christ.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But still others asked, “How can the
Christ come from Galilee? Doesn’t the Scripture say that the Christ
will come from the line of David and from Bethlehem, the village
where David lived?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So there was division in the crowd because
of Jesus. Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid a hand on
Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the officers returned to the chief
priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring Him
in?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Never has anyone spoken like this man!”
the officers answered. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Have you also been deceived?” replied
the Pharisees. “Have any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in
Him? But this crowd that does not know the law, they are under a
curse.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier
and who himself was one of them, asked, “Does our law convict a man
without first hearing from him to determine what he has done?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Aren’t you also from Galilee?” they
replied. “Look into it, and you will see that no prophet comes out
of Galilee.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then each went to his own home. </font>
