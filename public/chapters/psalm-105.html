</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Remember the wonders He has done, </p><p class="indent"> His marvels, and the <span class='spell ca'>judgments</span><span class='spell gb'>judgements</span><span class='spell us'>judgments</span> He has pronounced,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>O offspring of His servant Abraham, </p><p class="indent"> O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.

</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>He remembers His covenant forever, </p><p class="indent"> the word He ordained for a thousand generations—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>the covenant He made with Abraham, </p><p class="indent"> and the oath He swore to Isaac.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, </p><p class="indent"> to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>“I will give you the land of Canaan </p><p class="indent"> as the portion of your inheritance.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">12</span>When they were few in number, </p><p class="indent"> few indeed, and strangers in the land,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>they wandered from nation to nation, </p><p class="indent"> from one kingdom to another.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>He let no man oppress them; </p><p class="indent"> He rebuked kings on their behalf:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>“Do not touch My anointed ones! </p><p class="indent"> Do no harm to My prophets!”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>He called down famine on the land </p><p class="indent"> and cut off all their supplies<span class="fn">a</span>  of food.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>He sent a man before them—</p><p class="indent"> Joseph, sold as a slave.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>They bruised his feet with shackles </p><p class="indent"> and placed his neck in irons,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>until his prediction came true </p><p class="indent"> and the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> proved him right.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>The king sent and released him; </p><p class="indent"> the ruler of peoples set him free.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">21</span>He made him master of his household, </p><p class="indent"> ruler over all his substance,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>to instruct<span class="fn">b</span>  his princes as he pleased </p><p class="indent"> and teach his elders wisdom.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">23</span>Then Israel entered Egypt; </p><p class="indent"> Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> made His people very fruitful, </p><p class="indent"> more numerous than their foes,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>whose hearts He turned to hate His people, </p><p class="indent"> to conspire against His servants.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>He sent Moses His servant, </p><p class="indent"> and Aaron, whom He had chosen.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>They performed His miraculous signs among them, </p><p class="indent"> and wonders in the land of Ham.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>He sent darkness, and it became dark—</p><p class="indent"> yet they defied His words.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">29</span>He turned their waters to blood </p><p class="indent"> and caused their fish to die.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Their land teemed with frogs, </p><p class="indent"> even in their royal chambers.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">31</span>He spoke, and insects swarmed—</p><p class="indent"> gnats throughout their country.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>He gave them hail for rain, </p><p class="indent"> with lightning throughout their land.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>He struck their vines and fig trees </p><p class="indent"> and shattered the trees of their country.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">34</span>He spoke, and the locusts came—</p><p class="indent"> young locusts without number.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>They devoured every plant in their land </p><p class="indent"> and consumed the produce of their soil.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">36</span>Then He struck all the firstborn in their land, </p><p class="indent"> the firstfruits of all their <span class='spell ca'>vigour</span><span class='spell gb'>vigour</span><span class='spell us'>vigor</span>.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">37</span>He brought Israel out with silver and gold, </p><p class="indent"> and none among His tribes stumbled.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">38</span>Egypt was glad when they departed, </p><p class="indent"> for the dread of Israel had fallen on them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">39</span>He spread a cloud as a covering </p><p class="indent"> and a fire to light up the night.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">40</span>They asked, and He brought quail </p><p class="indent"> and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">41</span>He opened a rock, and water gushed out; </p><p class="indent"> it flowed like a river in the desert.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">42</span>For He remembered His holy promise </p><p class="indent"> to Abraham His servant.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">43</span>He brought forth His people with rejoicing, </p><p class="indent"> His chosen with shouts of joy.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">44</span>He gave them the lands of the nations, </p><p class="indent"> that they might inherit the fruit of others’ <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">45</span>that they might keep His statutes </p><p class="indent"> and obey His laws. </p><p class="indent1stline"> Hallelujah!<span class="fn">d</span> </p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">staff</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> LXX and Syriac; MT <i class="calibre6">to bind</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> LXX and Syriac; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">for had they not defied His words?</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">45</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Hallelu YAH</i>, meaning <i class="calibre6">Praise <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span></i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
