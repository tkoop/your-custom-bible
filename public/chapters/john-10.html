<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jesus the Good Shepherd<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 23:1–6; Ezekiel 34:11–24)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">1</span>“Truly, truly, I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the gate, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.
<span class="reftext">2</span>But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen for his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">4</span>When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.
<span class="reftext">5</span>But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will flee from him because they do not <span class='spell ca'>recognize</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognize</span> his voice.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Jesus spoke to them using this illustration, but they did not understand what <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was telling them.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> said to them again, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, I am the gate for the sheep.
<span class="reftext">8</span>All who came before <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span><span class="fn">a</span>  were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
<span class="reftext">9</span>I am the gate. If anyone enters through <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture.
<span class="reftext">10</span>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">11</span>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> life for the sheep.
<span class="reftext">12</span>The hired hand is not the shepherd, and the sheep are not his own. When he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf pounces on them and scatters the flock.
<span class="reftext">13</span>The man runs away because he is a hired servant and is unconcerned for the sheep.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">14</span>I am the good shepherd. I know <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> sheep and <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> sheep know <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>,
<span class="reftext">15</span>just as the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> knows <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> and I know the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>. And I lay down <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> life for the sheep.
<span class="reftext">16</span>I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them in as well, and they will listen to <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> voice. Then there will be one flock and one shepherd.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">17</span>The reason the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> loves <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> is that I lay down <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> life in order to take it up again.
<span class="reftext">18</span>No one takes it from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, but I lay it down of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> own accord.

This charge I have received from <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Again there was division among the Jews because of Jesus’ message.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and insane. Why would <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> listen to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>But others replied, “These are not the words of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus at the Feast of Dedication</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>At that time the <span class='cap'>Feast</span><span class='nocap'>feast</span><span class='bsb'>Feast</span> of Dedication<span class="fn">b</span>  took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,
<span class="reftext">23</span>and Jesus was walking in the temple courts<span class="fn">c</span>  in Solomon’s Colonnade.
<span class="reftext">24</span>So the Jews gathered around <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> and demanded, “How long will <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> keep us in suspense? If <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> are the Christ, tell us plainly.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">25</span>“I already told <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“but <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> did not believe.

<span class="reftext">26</span>But because <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are not <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> sheep, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> refuse to believe.
<span class="reftext">27</span>My sheep listen to <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> voice; I know them, and they follow <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>.
<span class="reftext">28</span>I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them out of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> hand.
<span class="reftext">29</span>My <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> who has given them to <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span> is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span><span class='bsb'>My</span> <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>’s hand.
<span class="reftext">30</span>I and the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> are one.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>At this, the Jews again picked up stones to stone <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span class="reftext">32</span>But Jesus responded, <span>“I have shown <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> many good works from the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>. For which of these do <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> stone <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>“We are not stoning <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>, who are a man, declare <span class='cap'>Yourself</span><span class='nocap'>yourself</span><span class='bsb'>Yourself</span> to be God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Is it not written in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span><span class='bsb'>Law</span>: ‘I have said <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are gods’<span class="fn">d</span>?
<span class="reftext">35</span>If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and the <span class='cap'>Scripture</span><span class='nocap'>scripture</span><span class='bsb'>Scripture</span> cannot be broken—

<span class="reftext">38</span>But if I am doing them, even though <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> do not believe <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, believe the works themselves, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may know and understand that the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span> is in <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, and I am in the <span class='cap'>Father</span><span class='nocap'>father</span><span class='bsb'>Father</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>At this, they tried again to seize <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, but <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> escaped their grasp.
