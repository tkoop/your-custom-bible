<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Jesus the Good Shepherd<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 23:1–6; Ezekiel 34:11–24)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">1</span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the gate, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber.
<span class="reftext">2</span>But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen for his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">4</span>When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.
<span class="reftext">5</span>But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will flee from him because they do not <span class='spell ca'>recognize</span><span class='spell gb'>recognise</span><span class='spell us'>recognize</span> his voice.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Jesus spoke to them using this illustration, but they did not understand what He was telling them.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So He said to them again, <span>“Truly, truly, I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.
<span class="reftext">8</span>All who came before Me<span class="fn">a</span>  were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
<span class="reftext">9</span>I am the gate. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture.
<span class="reftext">10</span>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in all its fullness.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">11</span>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
<span class="reftext">12</span>The hired hand is not the shepherd, and the sheep are not his own. When he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf pounces on them and scatters the flock.
<span class="reftext">13</span>The man runs away because he is a hired servant and is unconcerned for the sheep.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">14</span>I am the good shepherd. I know My sheep and My sheep know Me,
<span class="reftext">15</span>just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.
<span class="reftext">16</span>I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them in as well, and they will listen to My voice. Then there will be one flock and one shepherd.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">17</span>The reason the Father loves Me is that I lay down My life in order to take it up again.
<span class="reftext">18</span>No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from My Father.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Again there was division among the Jews because of Jesus’ message.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and insane. Why would you listen to Him?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>But others replied, “These are not the words of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus at the Feast of Dedication</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>At that time the Feast of Dedication<span class="fn">b</span>  took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,
<span class="reftext">23</span>and Jesus was walking in the temple courts<span class="fn">c</span>  in Solomon’s Colonnade.
<span class="reftext">24</span>So the Jews gathered around Him and demanded, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">25</span>“I already told you,”</span> Jesus replied, <span>“but you did not believe. The works I do in My Father’s name testify on My behalf.
<span class="reftext">26</span>But because you are not My sheep, you refuse to believe.
<span class="reftext">27</span>My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me.
<span class="reftext">28</span>I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them out of My hand.
<span class="reftext">29</span>My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all. No one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand.
<span class="reftext">30</span>I and the Father are one.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>At this, the Jews again picked up stones to stone Him.
<span class="reftext">32</span>But Jesus responded, <span>“I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone Me?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>“We are not stoning You for any good work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because You, who are a man, declare Yourself to be God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Is it not written in your Law: ‘I have said you are gods’<span class="fn">d</span>?
<span class="reftext">35</span>If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture cannot be broken—
<span class="reftext">36</span>then what about the One whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world? How then can you accuse Me of blasphemy for stating that I am the Son of God?</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">37</span>If I am not doing the works of My Father, then do not believe Me.
<span class="reftext">38</span>But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works themselves, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I am in the Father.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">39</span>At this, they tried again to seize Him, but He escaped their grasp.
</p><p class="hdg">John’s Testimony Confirmed</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had first been baptizing, and He stayed there.
<span class="reftext">41</span>Many came to Him and said, “Although John never performed a sign, everything he said about this man was true.”
<span class="reftext">42</span>And many in that place believed in Jesus.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> BYZ <i class="calibre6">All who came</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">22</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, Hanukkah, the historic celebration of the Maccabean Revolt and rededication of the temple<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the temple</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">34</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Psalm 82:6<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
