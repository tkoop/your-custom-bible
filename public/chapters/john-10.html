<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >Truly, truly, I
tell you, whoever does not enter the sheepfold by the gate, but
climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber. But the one who
enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens
the gate for him, and the sheep listen for his voice. He calls his
own sheep by name and leads them out. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >When he has brought
out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him
because they know his voice. But they will never follow a stranger;
in fact, they will flee from him because they do not recognize his
voice.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Jesus spoke to them using this
illustration, but they did not understand what He was telling them.
So He said to them again, <font color="#a80000">“Truly, truly, I
tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who came before Me were
thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the
gate. If anyone enters through Me, he will be saved. He will come in
and go out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill
and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it in all
its fullness.</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >I am the good
shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. The
hired hand is not the shepherd, and the sheep are not his own. When
he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then
the wolf pounces on them and scatters the flock. The man runs away
because he is a hired servant and is unconcerned for the sheep. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >I am the good
shepherd. I know My sheep and My sheep know Me, just as the Father
knows Me and I know the Father. And I lay down My life for the sheep.
I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them in as
well, and they will listen to My voice. Then there will be one flock
and one shepherd. </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >The reason the
Father loves Me is that I lay down My life in order to take it up
again. No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord. I
have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This
charge I have received from My Father.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Again there was division among the Jews
because of Jesus’ message. Many of them said, “He is
demon-possessed and insane. Why would you listen to Him?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >But others replied, “These are not the
words of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the
blind?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >At that time the Feast of Dedication took
place in Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the
temple courts in Solomon’s Colonnade. So the Jews gathered around
Him and demanded, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You
are the Christ, tell us plainly.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >I already told
you,”</font> Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“but you did
not believe. The works I do in My Father’s name testify on My
behalf. But because you are not My sheep, you refuse to believe. My
sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me. I give
them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them
out of My hand. My Father who has given them to Me is greater than
all. No one can snatch them out of My Father’s hand. I and the
Father are one.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >At this, the Jews again picked up stones
to stone Him. But Jesus responded, <font color="#a80000">“I have
shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you
stone Me?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font >We are not stoning You for any good
work,” said the Jews, “but for blasphemy, because You, who are a
man, declare Yourself to be God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Is
it not written in your Law: ‘I have said you are gods’? If he
called them gods to whom the word of God came—and the Scripture
cannot be broken— then what about the One whom the Father
sanctified and sent into the world? How then can you accuse Me of
blasphemy for stating that I am the Son of God?</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font >If I am not doing
the works of My Father, then do not believe Me. But if I am doing
them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works
themselves, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in
Me, and I am in the Father.” </font></font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >At this, they tried again to seize Him,
but He escaped their grasp. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to
the place where John had first been baptizing, and He stayed there.
Many came to Him and said, “Although John never performed a sign,
everything he said about this man was true.” And many in that place
believed in Jesus. </font>
