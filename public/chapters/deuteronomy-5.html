<span class="reftext">24</span>and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> said, “Behold, <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God has shown us <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> glory and greatness, and we have heard <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> voice out of the fire.

<span class="reftext">25</span>But now, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us, and we will die, if we hear the voice of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God any longer.
