<font >Then Moses summoned all Israel and said to
them: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Hear, O Israel, the statutes and
ordinances that I declare in your hearing this day. Learn them and
observe them carefully. The LORD our God made a covenant with us at
Horeb. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He did not make this covenant with our
fathers, but with all of us who are alive here today. The LORD spoke
with you face to face out of the fire on the mountain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time I was standing between the
LORD and you to declare to you the word of the LORD, because you were
afraid of the fire and would not go up the mountain. And He said: “I
am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out
of the house of slavery. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >You shall not make for yourself an idol in
the form of anything in the heavens above, on the earth below, or in
the waters beneath. You shall not bow down to them or worship them;
for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
the fathers on their children to the third and fourth generations of
those who hate Me, but showing loving devotion to a thousand
generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >You shall not take the name of the LORD
your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave anyone unpunished who
takes His name in vain. </font>

<font >Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it
holy, as the LORD your God has commanded you. Six days you shall
labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the
LORD your God, on which you must not do any work—neither you, nor
your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your ox
or donkey or any of your livestock, nor the foreigner within your
gates, so that your manservant and maidservant may rest as you do.
Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and that the
LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an
outstretched arm. That is why the LORD your God has commanded you to
keep the Sabbath day. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD spoke these commandments in a
loud voice to your whole assembly out of the fire, the cloud, and the
deep darkness on the mountain; He added nothing more. And He wrote
them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when you heard the voice out of the
darkness while the mountain was blazing with fire, all the heads of
your tribes and your elders approached me, and you said, “Behold,
the LORD our God has shown us His glory and greatness, and we have
heard His voice out of the fire. Today we have seen that a man can
live even if God speaks with him. But now, why should we die? For
this great fire will consume us, and we will die, if we hear the
voice of the LORD our God any longer. For who of all flesh has heard
the voice of the living God speaking out of the fire, as we have, and
survived? Go near and listen to all that the LORD our God says. Then
you can tell us everything the LORD our God tells you; we will listen
and obey.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD heard the words you spoke to
me, and He said to me, “I have heard the words that these people
have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken.
If only they had such a heart to fear Me and keep all My commandments
always, so that it might be well with them and with their children
forever. Go and tell them: ‘Return to your tents.’ But you stand
here with Me, that I may speak to you all the commandments and
statutes and ordinances you are to teach them to follow in the land
that I am giving them to possess.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So be careful to do as the LORD your God
has commanded you; you are not to turn aside to the right or to the
left. You must walk in all the ways that the LORD your God has
commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days
in the land that you will possess. </font>
