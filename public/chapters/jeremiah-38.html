<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son
of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchijah
heard that Jeremiah had been telling all the people: “This is what
the LORD says: Whoever stays in this city will die by sword and
famine and plague, but whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans will live;
he will retain his life like a spoil of war, and he will live. This
is what the LORD says: This city will surely be delivered into the
hands of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the officials said to the king, “This
man ought to die, for he is discouraging the warriors who remain in
this city, as well as all the people, by speaking such words to them;
this man is not seeking the well-being of these people, but their
ruin.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Here he is,” replied King Zedekiah.
“He is in your hands, since the king can do nothing to stop you.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they took Jeremiah and dropped him into
the cistern of Malchiah, the king’s son, which was in the courtyard
of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah with ropes into the cistern,
which had no water but only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Ebed-melech the Cushite, a court
official in the royal palace, heard that Jeremiah had been put into
the cistern. While the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin,
Ebed-melech went out from the king’s palace and said to the king,
“My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they
have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have dropped him into the
cistern, where he will starve to death, for there is no more bread in
the city.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the king commanded Ebed-melech the
Cushite, “Take thirty men from here with you and pull Jeremiah the
prophet out of the cistern before he dies.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Ebed-melech took the men with him and
went to the king’s palace, to a place below the storehouse. From
there he took old rags and worn-out clothes and lowered them with
ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Ebed-melech the Cushite cried out to
Jeremiah, “Put these worn-out rags and clothes under your arms to
pad the ropes.” Jeremiah did so, and they pulled him up with the
ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the
courtyard of the guard. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the
prophet and received him at the third entrance to the house of the
LORD. “I am going to ask you something,” said the king to
Jeremiah. “Do not hide anything from me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">If I tell you,” Jeremiah replied,
“you will surely put me to death. And even if I give you advice,
you will not listen to me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But King Zedekiah swore secretly to
Jeremiah, “As surely as the LORD lives, who has given us this life,
I will not kill you, nor will I deliver you into the hands of these
men who are seeking your life.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is
what the LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you indeed
surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then you will live,
this city will not be burned down, and you and your household will
survive. But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of
Babylon, then this city will be delivered into the hands of the
Chaldeans. They will burn it down, and you yourself will not escape
their grasp.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I
am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeans, for the
Chaldeans may deliver me into their hands to abuse me.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">They will not hand you over,”
Jeremiah replied. “Obey the voice of the LORD in what I am telling
you, that it may go well with you and you may live. But if you refuse
to surrender, this is the word that the LORD has shown me: All the
women who remain in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought
out to the officials of the king of Babylon, and those women will
say: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
‘<font face="Tahoma, serif">They misled you and overcame you—</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">those trusted friends of yours. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Your feet sank into the mire, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">and they deserted you.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">All your wives and children will be
brought out to the Chaldeans. And you yourself will not escape their
grasp, for you will be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city
will be burned down.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Zedekiah warned Jeremiah, “Do not
let anyone know about this conversation, or you will die. If the
officials hear that I have spoken with you, and they come and demand
of you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what he said to you;
do not hide it from us, or we will kill you,’ then tell them, ‘I
was presenting to the king my petition that he not return me to the
house of Jonathan to die there.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When all the officials came to Jeremiah
and questioned him, he relayed to them the exact words the king had
commanded him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had
overheard the conversation. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of
the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured. </font>
