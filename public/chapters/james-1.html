<font >To the twelve tribes of the Dispersion: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Greetings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Consider it pure joy, my brothers, when
you encounter trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing
of your faith develops perseverance. Allow perseverance to finish its
work, so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should
ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it
will be given to him. But he must ask in faith, without doubting,
because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by
the wind. That man should not expect to receive anything from the
Lord. He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The brother in humble circumstances should
exult in his high position. But the one who is rich should exult in
his low position, because he will pass away like a flower of the
field. For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant;
its flower falls and its beauty is lost. So too, the rich man will
fade away in the midst of his pursuits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Blessed is the man who perseveres under
trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown
of life that God has promised to those who love Him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When tempted, no one should say, “God is
tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt
anyone. But each one is tempted when by his own evil desires he is
lured away and enticed. Then after desire has conceived, it gives
birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the
Father of the heavenly lights, with whom there is no change or
shifting shadow. He chose to give us birth through the word of truth,
that we would be a kind of firstfruits of His creation. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >My beloved brothers, understand this:
Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger,
for man’s anger does not bring about the righteousness that God
desires. Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and every expression
of evil, and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save
your souls. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Be doers of the word, and not hearers
only. Otherwise, you are deceiving yourselves. For anyone who hears
the word but does not carry it out is like a man who looks at his
face in a mirror, and after observing himself goes away and
immediately forgets what he looks like. But the one who looks
intently into the perfect law of freedom, and continues to do so—not
being a forgetful hearer, but an effective doer—he will be blessed
in what he does. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If anyone considers himself religious and
yet does not bridle his tongue, he deceives his heart and his
religion is worthless. Pure and undefiled religion before our God and
Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their distress, and
to keep oneself from being polluted by the world. </font>
