Some time later I obtained leave from the king
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a><span class="reftext">7</span>to return to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah by providing him a room in the courts of the house of God.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>And I was greatly displeased and threw all of Tobiah’s household goods out of the room.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a><span class="reftext">9</span>Then I ordered that the rooms be purified, and I had the articles of the house of God restored to them, along with the grain offerings and frankincense.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a><span class="reftext">11</span>So I rebuked the officials and asked, “Why has the house of God been neglected?” </p><p class="reg1"> Then I gathered the Levites and singers together and stationed them at their posts,

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a><span class="reftext">16</span>Additionally, men of Tyre who lived there were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then I rebuked the nobles of Judah and asked, “What is this evil you are doing—profaning the Sabbath day?

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Once or twice, the merchants and those who sell all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem,

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a><span class="reftext">22</span>Then I instructed the Levites to purify themselves and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. </p><p class="reg1"> Remember me for this as well, O my God, and show me mercy according to Your abundant loving devotion.
