<font ><b>The Temple Cleansed</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At that time the Book of Moses was read
aloud in the hearing of the people, and in it they found the passage
stating that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of
God, because they had not met the Israelites with food and water, but
had hired Balaam to call down a curse against them (although our God
had turned the curse into a blessing). </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As soon as the people heard this law, they
excluded from Israel all of foreign descent. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now before this, Eliashib the priest, a
relative of Tobiah, had been put in charge of the storerooms of the
house of our God and had prepared for Tobiah a large room where they
had previously stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the
temple articles, and the tithes of grain, new wine, and oil
prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, along with the
contributions for the priests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While all this was happening, I was not in
Jerusalem, because I had returned to Artaxerxes king of Babylon in
the thirty-second year of his reign. Some time later I obtained leave
from the king to return to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that
Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah by providing him a room in the
courts of the house of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And I was greatly displeased and threw all
of Tobiah’s household goods out of the room. Then I ordered that
the rooms be purified, and I had the articles of the house of God
restored to them, along with the grain offerings and frankincense. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I also learned that because the portions
for the Levites had not been given to them, all the Levites and
singers responsible for performing the service had gone back to their
own fields. So I rebuked the officials and asked, “Why has the
house of God been neglected?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I gathered the Levites and singers
together and stationed them at their posts, and all Judah brought a
tenth of the grain, new wine, and oil into the storerooms. I
appointed as treasurers over the storerooms Shelemiah the priest,
Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites, with Hanan son of
Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, to assist them, because they were
considered trustworthy. They were responsible for distributing the
supplies to their fellow Levites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Remember me for this, O my God, and do not
blot out my deeds of loving devotion for the house of my God and for
its services. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In those days I saw people in Judah
treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading
it on donkeys, along with wine, grapes, and figs. All kinds of goods
were being brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned
them against selling food on that day. Additionally, men of Tyre who
lived there were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise and
selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I rebuked the nobles of Judah and
asked, “What is this evil you are doing—profaning the Sabbath
day? Did not your forefathers do the same things, so that our God
brought all this disaster on us and on this city? And now you are
rekindling His wrath against Israel by profaning the Sabbath!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the evening shadows began to fall on
the gates of Jerusalem, just before the Sabbath, I ordered that the
gates be shut and not opened until after the Sabbath. I posted some
of my servants at the gates so that no load could enter on the
Sabbath day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Once or twice, the merchants and those who
sell all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem, but I warned them,
“Why are you camping in front of the wall? If you do it again, I
will lay hands on you.” From that time on, they did not return on
the Sabbath. Then I instructed the Levites to purify themselves and
guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Remember me for this as well, O my God,
and show me mercy according to Your abundant loving devotion. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In those days I also saw Jews who had
married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. Half of their children
spoke the language of Ashdod or of the other peoples, but could not
speak the language of Judah. I rebuked them and called down curses on
them. I beat some of these men and pulled out their hair. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I made them take an oath before God
and said, “You must not give your daughters in marriage to their
sons or take their daughters as wives for your sons or for
yourselves! Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in matters like this?
There was not a king like him among many nations, and he was loved by
his God, who made him king over all Israel—yet foreign women drew
him into sin. Must we now hear that you too are doing all this
terrible evil and acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying
foreign women?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Even one of the sons of Jehoiada son of
Eliashib the high priest had become a son-in-law to Sanballat the
Horonite. Therefore I drove him away from me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Remember them, O my God, because they have
defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the
Levites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus I purified the priests and Levites
from everything foreign, and I assigned specific duties to each of
the priests and Levites. I also arranged for contributions of wood at
the appointed times, and for the firstfruits. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Remember me, O my God, with favor. </font>
