<font >Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came and
tested Jesus by asking Him to show them a sign from heaven. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But He replied, <font color="#a80000">“When
evening comes, you say, ‘The weather will be fair, for the sky is
red,’ and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky
is red and overcast.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of
the sky, but not the signs of the times. A wicked and adulterous
generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign
of Jonah.”</font> Then He left them and went away. </font>

<font >When they crossed to the other side, the
disciples forgot to take bread. <font color="#a80000">“Watch out!”</font>
Jesus told them. <font color="#a80000">“Beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees and Sadducees.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They discussed this among themselves and
concluded, “It is because we did not bring any bread.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Aware of their conversation, Jesus said,
<font color="#a80000">“You of little faith, why are you debating
among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand?
Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how
many basketfuls you gathered? Or the seven loaves for the four
thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? How do you not
understand that I was not telling you about bread? But beware of the
leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then they understood that He was not
telling them to beware of the leaven used in bread, but of the
teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. </font>

<font >When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea
Philippi, He questioned His disciples: <font color="#a80000">“Who
do people say the Son of Man is?”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They replied, “Some say John the
Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the
prophets.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font color="#a80000">“<font >But what about
you?”</font> Jesus asked. <font color="#a80000">“Who do you say I

<font >Simon Peter answered, “You are the
Christ, the Son of the living God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Jesus replied, <font color="#a80000">“Blessed
are you, Simon son of Jonah! For this was not revealed to you by
flesh and blood, but by My Father in heaven. And I tell you that you
are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of
Hades will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the
kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in
heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”</font>
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then He admonished the disciples not to
tell anyone that He was the Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >From that time on Jesus began to show His
disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the
hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and that He must be
killed and on the third day be raised to life. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke
Him. “Far be it from You, Lord!” he said. “This shall never

<font >But Jesus turned and said to Peter, <font color="#a80000">“Get
behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me. For you do not
have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.”</font> </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jesus told His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“If
anyone wants to come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his
cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it,
but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. What will it
profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or
what can a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of Man will
come in His Father’s glory with His angels, and then He will repay
each one according to what he has done.</font> </font>
