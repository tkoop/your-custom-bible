</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>But He replied, <span>“When evening comes, you say, ‘The weather will be fair, for the sky is red,’
<span class="reftext">3</span>and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but not the signs of the times.<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>A wicked and adulterous generation demands a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.”</span> Then He left them and went away.

<span><span class="reftext">6</span>“Watch out!”</span> Jesus told them. <span>“Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>They discussed this among themselves and concluded, “It is because we did not bring any bread.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Aware of their conversation, Jesus said, <span>“You of little faith, why are you debating among yourselves about having no bread?
<span class="reftext">9</span>Do you still not understand? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?
<span class="reftext">10</span>Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?
<span class="reftext">11</span>How do you not understand that I was not telling you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then they understood that He was not telling them to beware of the leaven used in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">15</span>“But what about you?”</span> Jesus asked. <span>“Who do you say I am?”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Jesus replied, <span>“Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah!<span class="fn">b</span>  For this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by My Father in heaven.
<span class="reftext">18</span>And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
<span class="reftext">19</span>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>Then He admonished the disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. “Far be it from You, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to You!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>But Jesus turned and said to Peter, <span>“Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me. For you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.”</span>

<span class="reftext">25</span>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.
<span class="reftext">26</span>What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
