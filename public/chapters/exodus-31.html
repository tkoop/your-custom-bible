<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “See, I
have called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe
of Judah. And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill,
ability, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship, to design
artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze, to cut gemstones for
settings, and to carve wood, so that he may be a master of every
craft. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, I have selected Oholiab son of
Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, as his assistant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I have also given skill to all the
craftsmen, that they may fashion all that I have commanded you: the
Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony and the mercy seat upon it,
and all the other furnishings of the tent— the table with its
utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of
incense, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the
basin with its stand— as well as the woven garments, both the holy
garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve
as priests, in addition to the anointing oil and fragrant incense for
the Holy Place. They are to make them according to all that I have
commanded you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “Tell the
Israelites, ‘Surely you must keep My Sabbaths, for this will be a
sign between Me and you for the generations to come, so that you may
know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you. Keep the Sabbath, for it
is holy to you. Anyone who profanes it must surely be put to death.
Whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from among his
people. For six days work may be done, but the seventh day is a
Sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on
the Sabbath day must surely be put to death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Israelites must keep the Sabbath,
celebrating it as a permanent covenant for the generations to come.
It is a sign between Me and the Israelites forever; for in six days
the LORD made the heavens and the earth, but on the seventh day He
rested and was refreshed.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the LORD had finished speaking with
Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of the Testimony,
tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God. </font>
