<font >Remind the believers to submit to rulers
and authorities, to be obedient and ready for every good work, to
malign no one, and to be peaceable and gentle, showing full

<font >But when the kindness of God our Savior
and His love for mankind appeared, He saved us, not by the righteous
deeds we had done, but according to His mercy, through the washing of
new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit. This is the Spirit He
poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that,
having been justified by His grace, we would become heirs with the
hope of eternal life. This saying is trustworthy. And I want you to
emphasize these things, so that those who have believed God will take
care to devote themselves to good deeds. These things are excellent
and profitable for the people. </font>

must also learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet
the pressing needs of others, so that they will not be unfruitful. </font>
