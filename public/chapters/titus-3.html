<font >Remind the believers to submit to rulers
and authorities, to be obedient and ready for every good work, to
malign no one, and to be peaceable and gentle, showing full
consideration to everyone. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For at one time we too were foolish,
disobedient, misled, and enslaved to all sorts of desires and
pleasuresâ€”living in malice and envy, being hated and hating one
another. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when the kindness of God our Savior
and His love for mankind appeared, He saved us, not by the righteous
deeds we had done, but according to His mercy, through the washing of
new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit. This is the Spirit He
poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that,
having been justified by His grace, we would become heirs with the
hope of eternal life. This saying is trustworthy. And I want you to
emphasize these things, so that those who have believed God will take
care to devote themselves to good deeds. These things are excellent
and profitable for the people. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But avoid foolish controversies,
genealogies, arguments, and quarrels about the law, because these
things are pointless and worthless. </font>

<font >Reject a divisive man after a first and
second admonition, knowing that such a man is corrupt and sinful; he
is self-condemned. </font>

<font >As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to
you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have
decided to winter there. Do your best to equip Zenas the lawyer and
Apollos, so that they will have everything they need. And our people
must also learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet
the pressing needs of others, so that they will not be unfruitful. </font>
