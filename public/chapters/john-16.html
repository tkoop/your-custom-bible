<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">I have told you
these things so that you will not fall away. They will put you out of
the synagogues. In fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you
will think he is offering a service to God. They will do these things
because they have not known the Father or Me. But I have told you
these things so that when their hour comes, you will remember that I
told you about them. I did not tell you these things from the
beginning, because I was with you. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Now, however, I am
going to Him who sent Me; yet none of you asks Me, ‘Where are You
going?’ Instead, your hearts are filled with sorrow because I have
told you these things. But I tell you the truth, it is for your
benefit that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not
come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you. </font></font>

He will convict the world in regard to sin and righteousness and
judgment: in regard to sin, because they do not believe in Me; in
regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you
will no longer see Me; and in regard to judgment, because the prince
of this world has been condemned. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">I still have much to
tell you, but you cannot yet bear to hear it. However, when the
Spirit of truth comes, He will guide you into all truth. For He will
not speak on His own, but He will speak what He hears, and He will
declare to you what is to come. He will glorify Me by taking from
what is Mine and disclosing it to you. Everything that belongs to the
Father is Mine. That is why I said that the Spirit will take from
what is Mine and disclose it to you. </font></font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then some of His disciples asked one

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Aware that they wanted to question Him,
Jesus said to them, <font color="#a80000">“Are you asking one
another why I said, ‘In a little while you will not see Me, and
then after a little while you will see Me’? Truly, truly, I tell
you, you will weep and wail while the world rejoices. You will
grieve, but your grief will turn to joy. A woman has pain in
childbirth because her time has come; but when she brings forth her
child, she forgets her anguish because of her joy that a child has
been born into the world. So also you have sorrow now, but I will see
you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away
your joy.</font> </font>

no longer ask Me anything. Truly, truly, I tell you, whatever you ask
the Father in My name, He will give you. Until now you have not asked
for anything in My name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy
may be complete. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">I have spoken these
things to you in figures of speech. An hour is coming when I will no
longer speak to you this way, but will tell you plainly about the
Father. In that day you will ask in My name. I am not saying that I
will ask the Father on your behalf. For the Father Himself loves you,
because you have loved Me and have believed that I came from God. I
came from the Father and entered the world. In turn, I will leave the
world and go to the Father.” </font></font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">His disciples said, “See, now You are

<font color="#a80000">“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Do you finally
believe?”</font> Jesus replied. <font color="#a80000">“Look, an
hour is coming and has already come when you will be scattered, each
to his own home, and you will leave Me all alone. Yet I am not alone,
because the Father is with Me. I have told you these things so that
in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But
take courage; I have overcome the world!”</font> </font>
