<font >Therefore, since Christ suffered in His
body, arm yourselves with the same resolve, because anyone who has
suffered in his body is done with sin. Consequently, he does not live
out his remaining time on earth for human passions, but for the will
of God. For you have spent enough time in the past carrying out the
same desires as the Gentiles: living in debauchery, lust,
drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and detestable idolatry. </font>

<font >Because of this, they consider it strange
of you not to plunge with them into the same flood of reckless
indiscretion, and they heap abuse on you. But they will have to give
an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. That
is why the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so
that they might be judged as men in the flesh, but live according to
God in the spirit. </font>

be clear-minded and sober, so that you can pray. Above all, love one
another deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. Show
hospitality to one another without complaining. </font>

<font >As good stewards of the manifold grace of
God, each of you should use whatever gift he has received to serve
one another. If anyone speaks, he should speak as one conveying the
words of God. If anyone serves, he should serve with the strength God

Christ, to whom be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen. </font>

<font >If you are insulted for the name of
Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests
on you. Indeed, none of you should suffer as a murderer or thief or
wrongdoer, or even as a meddler. But if you suffer as a Christian, do
not be ashamed, but glorify God that you bear that name. For it is
time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins
with us, what will the outcome be for those who disobey the gospel of
God? And, </font>
