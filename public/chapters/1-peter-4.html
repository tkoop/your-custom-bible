<span class="reftext">2</span>Consequently, he does not live out his remaining time on <span class='nocap'>Earth</span><span class='cap'>Earth</span><span class='bsb'>earth</span> for human passions, but for the will of God.
<span class="reftext">3</span>For you have spent enough time in the past carrying out the same desires as the Gentiles: living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing, and detestable idolatry.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Because of this, they consider it strange of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> not to plunge with them into the same flood of reckless indiscretion, and they heap abuse on <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">5</span>But they will have to give an account to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
<span class="reftext">6</span>That is why the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead,<span class="fn">b</span>  so that they might be judged as men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear-minded and sober, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> can pray.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Above all, love one another deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Show hospitality to one another without complaining.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>As good stewards of the manifold grace of God, each of you should use whatever gift he has received to serve one another.
<span class="reftext">11</span>If anyone speaks, he should speak as one conveying the words of God. If anyone serves, he should serve with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
</p><p class="hdg">Suffering as Christians</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial that has come upon <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, as though something strange were happening to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">13</span>But rejoice that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> share in the sufferings of Christ, so that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> may be overjoyed at the revelation of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> glory.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are insulted for the name of Christ, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are blessed, because the <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span><span class='bsb'>Spirit</span> of glory and of God rests on <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Indeed, none of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> should suffer as a murderer or thief or wrongdoer, or even as a meddler.
<span class="reftext">16</span>But if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but glorify God that you bear that name.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For it is time for <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span> to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who disobey the gospel of God?
