<font ><b>Paul’s Trial before Festus</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Three days after his arrival in the
province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem, where the chief
priests and Jewish leaders presented their case against Paul. They
urged Festus to grant them a concession against Paul by summoning him
to Jerusalem, because they were preparing an ambush to kill him along
the way. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Festus replied, “Paul is being held
in Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon. So if this man has
done anything wrong, let some of your leaders come down with me and
accuse him there.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After spending no more than eight or ten
days with them, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day he sat on
the judgment seat and ordered that Paul be brought in. When Paul
arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him,
bringing many serious charges that they could not prove. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Paul made his defense: “I have
committed no offense against the law of the Jews or against the
temple or against Caesar.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a
favor, said to Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to
stand trial before me on these charges?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Paul replied, “I am standing before the
judgment seat of Caesar, where I ought to be tried. I have done
nothing wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well. If,
however, I am guilty of anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to
die. But if there is no truth to their accusations against me, no one
has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Festus conferred with his council and
replied, “You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After several days had passed, King
Agrippa and Bernice came down to Caesarea to pay their respects to
Festus. Since they were staying several days, Festus laid out Paul’s
case before the king: “There is a certain man whom Felix left in
prison. While I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the
Jews presented their case and requested a judgment against him. I
told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand a man over before
he has had an opportunity to face his accusers and defend himself
against their charges. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So when they came here with me, I did not
delay. The next day I sat on the judgment seat and ordered that the
man be brought in. But when his accusers rose to speak, they did not
charge him with any of the crimes I had expected. They only had some
contentions with him regarding their own religion and a certain Jesus
who had died, but whom Paul affirmed to be alive. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Since I was at a loss as to how to
investigate these matters, I asked if he was willing to go to
Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges. But when Paul appealed
to be held over for the decision of the Emperor, I ordered that he be
held until I could send him to Caesar.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Agrippa said to Festus, “I would
like to hear this man myself.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Tomorrow you will hear him,” Festus
declared. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with
great pomp and entered the auditorium, along with the commanders and
leading men of the city. And Festus ordered that Paul be brought in. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and all
who are present with us, you see this man. The whole Jewish community
has petitioned me about him, both here and in Jerusalem, crying out
that he ought not to live any longer. But I found he had done nothing
worthy of death, and since he has now appealed to the Emperor, I
decided to send him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I have nothing definite to write to our
sovereign one about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of
you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this
inquiry I may have something to write. For it seems unreasonable to
me to send on a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.”
