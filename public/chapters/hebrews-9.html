<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Earthly Tabernacle<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Exodus 40:1–33; Acts 7:44–47)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now the first covenant<span class="fn">a</span>  had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary.
<span class="reftext">2</span>A tabernacle was prepared. In its first room were the lampstand, the table, and the consecrated bread.<span class="fn">b</span>  This was called the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span>.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Behind the second curtain was a room called the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span>,<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">4</span>containing the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. Inside the ark were the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Above the ark were the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy seat.<span class="fn">d</span>  But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>When everything had been prepared in this way, the priests entered regularly into the first room to perform their sacred duties.
<span class="reftext">7</span>But only the high priest entered the second room, and then only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>By this arrangement the <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> was showing that the way into the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span><span class="fn">e</span>  had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.
<span class="reftext">9</span>It is an illustration for the present time, because the gifts and sacrifices being offered were unable to cleanse the conscience of the worshiper.
<span class="reftext">10</span>They consist only in food and drink and special washings—external regulations imposed until the time of reform.
</p><p class="hdg">Redemption through His Blood</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that have come,<span class="fn">f</span>  <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made by hands and is not a part of this creation.
<span class="reftext">12</span>He did not enter by the blood of goats and calves, but <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> entered the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span> once for all by <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> own blood, thus securing eternal redemption.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that their bodies are clean,
<span class="reftext">14</span>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal <span class='cap'>Spirit</span><span class='nocap'>spirit</span> offered <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> unblemished to God, purify our<span class="fn">g</span>  consciences from works of death, so that we may serve the living God!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Therefore Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, now that <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has died to redeem them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>In the case of a will,<span class="fn">h</span>  it is necessary to establish the death of the one who made it,
<span class="reftext">17</span>because a will does not take effect until the one who made it has died; it cannot be executed while he is still alive.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>That is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.
<span class="reftext">19</span>For when Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats,<span class="fn">i</span>  along with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people,
<span class="reftext">20</span>saying, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to keep.”<span class="fn">j</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>In the same way, he sprinkled with blood the tabernacle and all the vessels used in worship.
<span class="reftext">22</span>According to the law, in fact, nearly everything must be purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>So it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
<span class="reftext">24</span>For Christ did not enter a man-made copy of the true sanctuary, but <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> entered heaven itself, now to appear on our behalf in the presence of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Nor did <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> enter heaven to offer <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span> again and again, as the high priest enters the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span> <span class='cap'>Holy</span><span class='nocap'>holy</span> <span class='cap'>Place</span><span class='nocap'>place</span> every year with blood that is not his own.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Otherwise, Christ would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of <span class='cap'>Himself</span><span class='nocap'>himself</span>.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Just as man is appointed to die once, and after that to face <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span>,
<span class="reftext">28</span>so also Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many; and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span>.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the first</i>; also in verse 18; see the footnote for Hebrews 8:13.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Bread of the Presence</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Holy of Holies</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">atonement cover</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Holy Place</i>; also in verses 12 and 25<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">11</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">that are to come</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">g</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">your</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">h</span> Greek <i class="calibre6">diathēkē</i> is also translated as <i class="calibre6">covenant</i> throughout this chapter.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">i</span> SBL does not include <i class="calibre6">and goats</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">j</span> Exodus 24:8<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
