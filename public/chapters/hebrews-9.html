<font ><b>Redemption through His Blood</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the first covenant had regulations for
worship and also an earthly sanctuary. A tabernacle was prepared. In
its first room were the lampstand, the table, and the consecrated
bread. This was called the Holy Place. Behind the second curtain was
a room called the Most Holy Place, containing the golden altar of
incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. Inside the ark were
the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the stone
tablets of the covenant. Above the ark were the cherubim of glory,
overshadowing the mercy seat. But we cannot discuss these things in
detail now. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When everything had been prepared in this
way, the priests entered regularly into the first room to perform
their sacred duties. But only the high priest entered the second
room, and then only once a year, and never without blood, which he
offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in
ignorance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >By this arrangement the Holy Spirit was
showing that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been
disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing. It is
an illustration for the present time, because the gifts and
sacrifices being offered were unable to cleanse the conscience of the
worshiper. They consist only in food and drink and special
washings—external regulations imposed until the time of reform. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But when Christ came as high priest of the
good things that have come, He went through the greater and more
perfect tabernacle that is not made by hands and is not a part of
this creation. He did not enter by the blood of goats and calves, but
He entered the Most Holy Place once for all by His own blood, thus
securing eternal redemption. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For if the blood of goats and bulls and
the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean
sanctify them so that their bodies are clean, how much more will the
blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself
unblemished to God, purify our consciences from works of death, so
that we may serve the living God! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore Christ is the mediator of a new
covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised
eternal inheritance, now that He has died to redeem them from the
transgressions committed under the first covenant. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the case of a will, it is necessary to
establish the death of the one who made it, because a will does not
take effect until the one who made it has died; it cannot be executed
while he is still alive. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That is why even the first covenant was
not put into effect without blood. For when Moses had proclaimed
every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of
calves and goats, along with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and
sprinkled the scroll and all the people, saying, “This is the blood
of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the same way, he sprinkled with blood
the tabernacle and all the vessels used in worship. According to the
law, in fact, nearly everything must be purified with blood, and
without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So it was necessary for the copies of the
heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the
heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For
Christ did not enter a man-made copy of the true sanctuary, but He
entered heaven itself, now to appear on our behalf in the presence of
God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Nor did He enter heaven to offer Himself
again and again, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every
year with blood that is not his own. Otherwise, Christ would have had
to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now He
has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin
by the sacrifice of Himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Just as man is appointed to die once, and
after that to face judgment, so also Christ was offered once to bear
the sins of many; and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin,
but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await Him. </font>
