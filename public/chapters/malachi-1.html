</p><p class="indent1stline"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“I have loved you,” says the LORD. </p><p class="reg1"> But you ask, “How have You loved us?” </p><p class="reg1">“Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the LORD. “Yet Jacob I have loved,
<span class="reftext">3</span>but Esau I have hated,<span class="fn">b</span>  and I have made his mountains a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.<span class="fn">c</span>”
</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Though Edom may say, “We have been devastated, but we will rebuild the ruins,” this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Land of Wickedness, and a people with whom the LORD is indignant forever.
<span class="reftext">5</span>You will see this with your own eyes, and you yourselves will say, ‘The LORD is great—even beyond the borders of Israel.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”

Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you or show you favour?” asks the LORD of Hosts.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“But ask now for God’s favour. Will He be gracious? Since this has come from your hands, will He show you favour?” asks the LORD of Hosts.
