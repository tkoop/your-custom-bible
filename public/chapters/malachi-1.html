“<font >I have loved you,” says the LORD. </font>
</p>

<font >But you ask, “How have You loved us?” </font>

“<font >Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?”
declares the LORD. “Yet Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated,
and I have made his mountains a wasteland and left his inheritance to
the desert jackals.” </font>

<font >Though Edom may say, “We have been
devastated, but we will rebuild the ruins,” this is what the LORD
of Hosts says: “They may build, but I will demolish. They will be
called the Land of Wickedness, and a people with whom the LORD is
indignant forever. You will see this with your own eyes, and you
yourselves will say, ‘The LORD is great—even beyond the borders
of Israel.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>

“<font >A son honors his father, and a servant
his master. But if I am a father, where is My honor? And if I am a
master, where is your fear of Me?” says the LORD of Hosts to you
priests who despise My name. </font>

“<font >But you ask, ‘How have we despised
Your name?’ </font>

<font >When you offer blind animals for
sacrifice, is it not wrong? And when you present the lame and sick
ones, is it not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he
be pleased with you or show you favor?” asks the LORD of Hosts. </font>

“<font >But ask now for God’s favor. Will He
be gracious? Since this has come from your hands, will He show you
favor?” asks the LORD of Hosts. </font>

“<font >Oh, that one of you would shut the
temple doors, so that you would no longer kindle useless fires on My

<font >For My name will be great among the
nations, from where the sun rises to where it sets. In every place,
incense and pure offerings will be presented in My name, because My
name will be great among the nations,” says the LORD of Hosts. “But
you profane it when you say, ‘The table of the Lord is defiled, and
as for its fruit, its food is contemptible.’ </font>

<font >You also say: ‘Oh, what a nuisance!’
And you turn up your nose at it,” says the LORD of Hosts. </font>

“<font >You bring offerings that are stolen,
