<font ><b>Josiah Renews the Covenant</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Josiah was eight years old when he became
king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. And he did what
was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in the ways of his
father David; he did not turn aside to the right or to the left. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the eighth year of his reign, while he
was still young, Josiah began to seek the God of his father David,
and in the twelfth year he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem of
the high places, the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast
images. Then in his presence the altars of the Baals were torn down,
and he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them. He
shattered the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images,
crushed them to dust, and scattered them over the graves of those who
had sacrificed to them. Then he burned the bones of the priests on
their altars. So he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Josiah did the same in the cities of
Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins
around them. He tore down the altars and Asherah poles, crushed the
idols to powder, and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout
the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now in the eighteenth year of his reign,
in order to cleanse the land and the temple, Josiah sent Shaphan son
of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah son of
Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they went to Hilkiah the high priest
and gave him the money that had been brought into the house of God,
which the Levites at the doors had collected from the people of
Manasseh and Ephraim, from all the remnant of Israel, Judah, and
Benjamin, and from the people of Jerusalem. They put it into the
hands of the supervisors of those doing the work of the house of the
LORD, who in turn gave it to the workmen restoring and repairing the
house of the LORD. They also gave money to the carpenters and
builders to buy dressed stone, as well as timbers for couplings and
beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to
deteriorate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the men did the work faithfully. The
Levites overseeing them were Jahath and Obadiah, descendants of
Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descendants of Kohath. Other
Levites, all skilled with musical instruments, were over the laborers
and supervised all who did the work, task by task. Some of the
Levites were secretaries, officers, and gatekeepers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While they were bringing out the money
that had been taken into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest
found the Book of the Law of the LORD written by Moses. And Hilkiah
said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the Book of the Law in
the house of the LORD!” And he gave it to Shaphan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Shaphan brought the book to the king
and reported, “Your servants are doing all that has been placed in
their hands. They have paid out the money that was found in the house
of the LORD and have put it into the hands of the supervisors and
workers.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, Shaphan the scribe told the
king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read
it in the presence of the king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the king heard the words of the Law,
he tore his clothes and commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan,
Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the servant of the
king: “Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for those remaining in
Israel and Judah concerning the words in the book that has been
found. For great is the wrath of the LORD that has been poured out on
us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD by doing
all that is written in this book.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Hilkiah and those the king had
designated went and spoke to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of
Shallum son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the
wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Huldah said to them, “This is what
the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Tell the man who sent you that
this is what the LORD says: I am about to bring calamity on this
place and on its people, according to all the curses written in the
book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah, because
they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods, that they
might provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands. My wrath
will be poured out upon this place and will not be quenched.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But as for the king of Judah, who sent you
to inquire of the LORD, tell him that this is what the LORD, the God
of Israel, says: ‘As for the words that you heard, because your
heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard
His words against this place and against its people, and because you
have humbled yourself before Me and you have torn your clothes and
wept before Me, I have heard you,’ declares the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
‘<font >Now I will indeed gather you to your
fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes
will not see all the calamity that I will bring on this place and on
its inhabitants.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they brought her answer back to the
king. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the king summoned all the elders of
Judah and Jerusalem. And he went up to the house of the LORD with all
the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the priests and the
Levites—all the people small and great—and in their hearing he
read all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in
the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the king stood by the pillar and made a
covenant before the LORD to follow the LORD and to keep His
commandments, decrees, and statutes with all his heart and all his
soul, and to carry out the words of this covenant that were written
in this book. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and
Benjamin take a stand in agreement to it. So all the people of
Jerusalem carried out the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Josiah removed all the abominations
from all the lands belonging to the Israelites, and he required
everyone in Israel to serve the LORD their God. Throughout his reign
they did not turn aside from following the LORD, the God of their
fathers. </font>
