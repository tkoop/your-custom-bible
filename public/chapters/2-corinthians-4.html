<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Light of the Gospel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore, since God in His mercy has given us this ministry,<span class="fn">a</span>  we do not lose heart.
<span class="reftext">2</span>Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful ways. We do not practice deceit, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by open proclamation of the truth, we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
<span class="reftext">5</span>For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.
<span class="reftext">6</span>For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,”<span class="fn">b</span>  made His light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Treasure in Jars of Clay<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Romans 6:1–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this surpassingly great power is from God and not from us.
<span class="reftext">8</span>We are hard pressed on all sides, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;
<span class="reftext">9</span>persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For we who are alive are always consigned to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal body.
<span class="reftext">12</span>So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And in keeping with what is written: “I believed, therefore I have spoken,”<span class="fn">d</span>  we who have the same spirit of faith also believe and therefore speak,
<span class="reftext">14</span>knowing that the One who raised the Lord Jesus<span class="fn">e</span>  will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in His presence.
<span class="reftext">15</span>All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is extending to more and more people may overflow in thanksgiving, to the glory of God.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, yet our inner self is being renewed day by day.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory that is far beyond comparison.
<span class="reftext">18</span>So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">Therefore, having this ministry, as we have received mercy,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Genesis 1:3<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> SBL, NE, and WH <i class="calibre6">in the face of Christ</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Psalm 116:10 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> SBL <i class="calibre6">who raised Jesus</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
