<font >Therefore, since God in His mercy has
given us this ministry, we do not lose heart. Instead, we have
renounced secret and shameful ways. We do not practice deceit, nor do
we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by open proclamation of
the truth, we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the
sight of God. And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those
who are perishing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The god of this age has blinded the minds
of unbelievers so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the
glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For we do not proclaim
ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants
for Jesus’ sake. For God, who said, “Let light shine out of
darkness,” made His light shine in our hearts to give us the light
of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now we have this treasure in jars of clay
to show that this surpassingly great power is from God and not from
us. We are hard pressed on all sides, but not crushed; perplexed, but
not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not
destroyed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We always carry around in our body the
death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our
body. For we who are alive are always consigned to death for Jesus’
sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal
body. So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And in keeping with what is written: “I
believed, therefore I have spoken,” we who have the same spirit of
faith also believe and therefore speak, knowing that the One who
raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us
with you in His presence. All this is for your benefit, so that the
grace that is extending to more and more people may overflow in
thanksgiving, to the glory of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our
outer self is wasting away, yet our inner self is being renewed day
by day. For our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an
eternal weight of glory that is far beyond comparison. So we fix our
eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is
temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. </font>
