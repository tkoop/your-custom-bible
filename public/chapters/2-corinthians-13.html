<font >This is the third time I am coming to you.

witnesses.” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I already warned you the second time I was
with you. So now in my absence I warn those who sinned earlier and
everyone else: If I return, I will not spare anyone, since you are
demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in
dealing with you, but is powerful among you. For He was indeed
crucified in weakness, yet He lives by God’s power. And though we
are weak in Him, yet by God’s power we will live with Him to serve
you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Examine yourselves to see whether you are
in the faith; test yourselves. Can’t you see for yourselves that
Jesus Christ is in you—unless you actually fail the test? And I
hope you will realize that we have not failed the test. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now we pray to God that you will not do
anything wrong—not that we will appear to have stood the test, but
that you will do what is right, even if we appear to have failed. For
we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth. In
fact, we rejoice when we are weak but you are strong, and our prayer
is for your perfection. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is why I write these things while
absent, so that when I am present I will not need to be severe in my
use of the authority that the Lord gave me for building you up, not
for tearing you down. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Finally, brothers, rejoice! Aim for
perfect harmony, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in
peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you. </font>

<font >All the saints send you greetings. </font>

the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of
you. </font>
