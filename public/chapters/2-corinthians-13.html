</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>I already warned you the second time I was with you. So now in my absence I warn those who sinned earlier and everyone else: If I return, I will not spare anyone,
<span class="reftext">3</span>since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.
<span class="reftext">4</span>For He was indeed crucified in weakness, yet He lives by God’s power. And though we are weak in Him, yet by God’s power we will live with Him to serve you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Can’t you see for yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you—unless you actually fail the test?
<span class="reftext">6</span>And I hope you will realize that we have not failed the test.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong—not that we will appear to have stood the test, but that you will do what is right, even if we appear to have failed.
<span class="reftext">8</span>For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
<span class="reftext">9</span>In fact, we rejoice when we are weak but you are strong, and our prayer is for your perfection.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>This is why I write these things while absent, so that when I am present I will not need to be severe in my use of the authority that the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.
</p><p class="hdg">Benediction and Farewell</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Finally, brothers, rejoice! Aim for perfect harmony, encourage one another,<span class="fn">b</span>  be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.
