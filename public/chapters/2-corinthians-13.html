<span class="reftext">3</span>since <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, but is powerful among <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">4</span>For <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was indeed crucified in weakness, yet <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> lives by God’s power.

<span class="reftext">8</span>For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
