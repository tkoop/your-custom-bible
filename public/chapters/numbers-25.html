<span class="reftext">2</span>who also invited them to the sacrifices for their gods. And the people ate and bowed down to these gods.
<span class="reftext">3</span>So Israel joined in worshiping Baal of Peor, and the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, so that His fierce anger may turn away from Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>So Moses told the judges of Israel, “Each of you must kill all of his men who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor.”
</p><p class="hdg">The Zeal of Phinehas</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Just then an Israelite man brought to his family a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and the whole congregation of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
<span class="reftext">7</span>On seeing this, Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, got up from the assembly, took a spear in his hand,
<span class="reftext">8</span>followed the Israelite into his tent, and drove the spear through both of them—through the Israelite and on through the belly of the woman. </p><p class="reg1"> So the plague against the Israelites was halted,
<span class="reftext">9</span>but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">11</span>“Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned My wrath away from the Israelites; for he was zealous for My sake among them, so that I did not consume the Israelites in My zeal.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Declare, therefore, that I am granting him My covenant of peace.
<span class="reftext">13</span>It will be a covenant of permanent priesthood for him and his descendants, because he was zealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The name of the Israelite who was slain with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the name of the slain Midianite woman was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to Moses,
<span class="reftext">17</span>“Attack the Midianites and strike them dead.
<span class="reftext">18</span>For they assailed you deceitfully when they seduced you in the matter of Peor and their sister Cozbi, the daughter of the Midianite leader, the woman who was killed on the day the plague came because of Peor.”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Acacia Grove</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
