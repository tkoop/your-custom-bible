<font ><b>Moab Seduces Israel</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >While Israel was staying in Shittim, the
men began to indulge in sexual immorality with the daughters of Moab,
who also invited them to the sacrifices for their gods. And the
people ate and bowed down to these gods. So Israel joined in
worshiping Baal of Peor, and the anger of the LORD burned against
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Take all
the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight before
the LORD, so that His fierce anger may turn away from Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Moses told the judges of Israel, “Each
of you must kill all of his men who have joined in worshiping Baal of
Peor.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Just then an Israelite man brought to his
family a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and the whole
congregation of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the
Tent of Meeting. On seeing this, Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of
Aaron the priest, got up from the assembly, took a spear in his hand,
followed the Israelite into his tent, and drove the spear through
both of them—through the Israelite and on through the belly of the
woman. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the plague against the Israelites was
halted, but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Moses, “Phinehas
son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned My wrath away
from the Israelites; for he was zealous for My sake among them, so
that I did not consume the Israelites in My zeal. Declare, therefore,
that I am granting him My covenant of peace. It will be a covenant of
permanent priesthood for him and his descendants, because he was
zealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The name of the Israelite who was slain
with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a
Simeonite family. And the name of the slain Midianite woman was
Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD said to Moses, “Attack the
Midianites and strike them dead. For they assailed you deceitfully
when they seduced you in the matter of Peor and their sister Cozbi,
the daughter of the Midianite leader, the woman who was killed on the
day the plague came because of Peor.” </font>
