<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Absalom’s Conspiracy</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Some time later, Absalom provided for himself a chariot with horses and fifty men to run ahead of him.
<span class="reftext">2</span>He would get up early and stand beside the road leading to the city gate. </p><p class="reg1"> Whenever anyone had a grievance to bring before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out and ask, “What city are you from?” And if he replied, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel,”
<span class="reftext">3</span>Absalom would say, “Look, your claims are good and right, but the king has no deputy to hear you.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And he would add, “If only someone would appoint me judge in the land, then everyone with a grievance or dispute could come to me, and I would give him justice.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Also, when anyone approached to bow down to him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Absalom did this to all the Israelites who came to the king for justice. In this way he stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>After four<span class="fn">a</span>  years had passed, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go to Hebron to <span class='spell ca'>fulfill</span><span class='spell gb'>fulfil</span><span class='spell us'>fulfill</span> a vow I have made to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">8</span>For your servant made a vow while dwelling in Geshur of Aram, saying: ‘If indeed <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> brings me back to Jerusalem, I will worship <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> in Hebron.’<span class="fn">b</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“Go in peace,” said the king. So Absalom got up and went to Hebron.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then Absalom sent spies throughout the tribes of Israel with this message: “When <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> hear the sound of the horn, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are to say, ‘Absalom reigns in Hebron!’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Two hundred men from Jerusalem accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and they went along innocently, for they knew nothing about the matter.
<span class="reftext">12</span>While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s <span class='spell ca'>counsellor</span><span class='spell gb'>counsellor</span><span class='spell us'>counselor</span>, to come from his hometown of Giloh. </p><p class="reg1"> So the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom’s following kept increasing.
</p><p class="hdg">David Flees Jerusalem<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 3:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then a messenger came to David and reported, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>And David said to all the servants with him in Jerusalem, “Arise and let us flee, or we will not escape from Absalom! We must leave quickly, or he will soon overtake us, heap disaster on us, and put the city to the sword.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>The king’s servants replied, “Whatever our lord the king decides, we are your servants.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then the king set out, and his entire household followed him. But he left behind ten concubines to take care of the palace.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>So the king set out with all the people following him. He stopped at the last house,
<span class="reftext">18</span>and all his servants marched past him—all the Cherethites and Pelethites, and six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you also go with us? Go back and stay with the new king, since you are both a foreigner and an exile from your homeland.
<span class="reftext">20</span>In fact, you arrived only yesterday; should I make you wander around with us today while I do not know where I am going? Go back and take your brothers with you. May <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> show you loving devotion and faithfulness.<span class="fn">c</span>”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>But Ittai answered the king, “As surely as <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>“March on then,” said David to Ittai. So Ittai the Gittite marched past with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>Everyone in the countryside was weeping loudly as all the people passed by. And as the king crossed the Kidron <span class='cap'>Valley</span><span class='nocap'>valley</span><span class='bsb'>Valley</span>, all the people also passed toward the way of the wilderness.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Zadok was also there, and all the Levites with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices<span class="fn">d</span>  until the people had passed out of the city.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then the king said to Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city. If I find <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span> in the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> will bring me back and let me see both it and <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> dwelling place again.
<span class="reftext">26</span>But if <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> should say, ‘I do not delight in you,’ then here I am; let <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> do to me whatever seems good to <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer?<span class="fn">e</span>  Return to the city in peace—you with your son Ahimaaz, and Abiathar with his son Jonathan.<span class="fn">f</span> 
<span class="reftext">28</span>See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to inform me.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and stayed there.
</p><p class="hdg">David Weeps at the Mount of Olives<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 63:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went up. His head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. And all the people with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">31</span>Now someone told David: “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.” </p><p class="reg1"> So David pleaded, “O <span class="lord" data-name="LORD"><span class="lord" data-name="LORD">LORD</span></span>, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>When David came to the summit, where he used to worship God, Hushai the Archite was there to meet him with his robe torn and dust on his head.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.
<span class="reftext">34</span>But you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me if you return to the city and say to Absalom: ‘I will be your servant, my king; in the past I was your father’s servant, but now I will be your servant.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be there with you? Report to them everything you hear from the king’s palace.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Indeed, their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with everything <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> hear.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>So David’s friend Hushai arrived in Jerusalem just as Absalom was entering the city.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Syriac and some LXX manuscripts; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">forty</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Some LXX manuscripts; Hebrew does not include <i class="calibre6">in Hebron</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> LXX; Hebrew <i class="calibre6">May loving devotion and faithfulness be with you.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">24</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Abiathar went up</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Hebrew; LXX <i class="calibre6">Behold,</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan son of Abiathar, your two sons with you</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
