<font ><b>Gideon Defeats Midian</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Early in the morning Jerubbaal (that is,
Gideon) and all the men with him camped beside the spring of Harod.
And the camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill
of Moreh. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Gideon, “You have
too many people for Me to deliver Midian into their hands, lest
Israel glorify themselves over Me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved
me.’ Now, therefore, proclaim in the hearing of the people:
‘Whoever is fearful and trembling may turn back and leave Mount
Gilead.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So twenty-two thousand of them turned
back, but ten thousand remained. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Gideon, “There are
still too many people. Take them down to the water, and I will sift
them for you there. If I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’
he shall go. But if I say, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he
shall not go.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Gideon brought the people down to the
water, and the LORD said to him, “Separate those who lap the water
with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel to drink.” And
the number of those who lapped the water with their hands to their
mouths was three hundred men; all the others knelt to drink. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Gideon, “With the
three hundred men who lapped the water I will save you and deliver
the Midianites into your hand. But all the others are to go home.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites
to their tents but kept the three hundred men, who took charge of the
provisions and rams’ horns of the others. And the camp of Midian
lay below him in the valley. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >That night the LORD said to Gideon, “Get
up and go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your
hand. But if you are afraid to do so, then go down to the camp with
your servant Purah and listen to what they are saying. Then your
hands will be strengthened to attack the camp.” So he went with
Purah his servant to the outposts where armed men were guarding the
camp. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now the Midianites, Amalekites, and all
the other people of the east had settled in the valley like a swarm
of locusts, and their camels were as countless as the sand on the
seashore. And as Gideon arrived, a man was telling his friend about a
dream. “Behold, I had a dream,” he said, “and I saw a loaf of
barley bread come tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the
tent so hard that the tent overturned and collapsed.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >His friend replied: “This is nothing
less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has
delivered Midian and the whole camp into his hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Gideon heard the dream and its
interpretation, he bowed in worship. He returned to the camp of
Israel and said, “Get up, for the LORD has delivered the camp of
Midian into your hand.” And he divided the three hundred men into
three companies and gave each man a ram’s horn in one hand and a
large jar in the other, containing a torch. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Watch me and do as I do,” Gideon
said. “When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do exactly as I
do. When I and all who are with me blow our horns, then you are also
to blow your horns from all around the camp and shout, ‘For the
LORD and for Gideon!’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Gideon and the hundred men with him
reached the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle
watch, just after the changing of the guard. They blew their horns
and broke the jars that were in their hands. The three companies blew
their horns and shattered their jars. Holding the torches in their
left hands and the horns in their right hands, they shouted, “A
sword for the LORD and for Gideon!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Each Israelite took his position around
the camp, and the entire Midianite army fled, crying out as they ran.
And when the three hundred rams’ horns sounded, the LORD set all
the men in the camp against one another with their swords. The army
fled to Beth-shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of
Abel-meholah near Tabbath. Then the men of Israel were called out
from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and they pursued the
Midianites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill
country of Ephraim to say, “Come down against the Midianites and
seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth-barah.”
So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they captured the
waters of the Jordan as far as Beth-barah. They also captured Oreb
and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian; and they killed Oreb at the rock
of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. So they pursued the
Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the
other side of the Jordan. </font>
