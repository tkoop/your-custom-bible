</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Grace and peace to you from God our Father

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >I thank my God every time I remember you.
In every prayer for all of you, I always pray with joy, because of
your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, being
confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it
on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >It is right for me to feel this way about
all of you, since I have you in my heart. For in my chains and in my
defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partners in grace
with me. God is my witness how I long for all of you with the
affection of Christ Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >And this is my prayer: that your love may
abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you
may be able to test and prove what is best and may be pure and
blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of
righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and
praise of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Now I want you to know, brothers, that my
circumstances have actually served to advance the gospel. As a
result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to
everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. And most of the
brothers, confident in the Lord by my chains, now dare more greatly
to speak the word without fear. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >It is true that some preach Christ out of
envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. The latter do so in
love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel. The
former, however, preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not
sincerely, supposing that they can add to the distress of my chains. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >What then is the issue? Just this: that in
every way, whether by false motives or true, Christ is preached. And
in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, because I
know that through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of
Jesus Christ, my distress will turn out for my deliverance. I eagerly
expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have
complete boldness so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my
body, whether by life or by death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >For to me, to live is Christ, and to die
is gain. But if I go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful
labor for me. So what shall I choose? I do not know. I am torn
between the two. I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far
better indeed. But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the
body. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Convinced of this, I know that I will
remain and will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in
the faith, so that through my coming to you again your exultation in
Christ Jesus will resound on account of me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font >Nevertheless, conduct yourselves in a
manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see
you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand
firm in one spirit, contending side by side for the faith of the
gospel, without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you.
This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation, and
it is from God. For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ
not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him, since you are
encountering the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I
still have. </font>
