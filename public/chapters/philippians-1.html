<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Greetings from Paul and Timothy<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Colossians 1:1–2; Philemon 1:1–3)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, </p><p class="reg1"> To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</p><p class="hdg">Thanksgiving and Prayer<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(1 Corinthians 1:4–9; Colossians 1:3–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>I thank my God every time I remember you.
<span class="reftext">4</span>In every prayer for all of you, I always pray with joy,
<span class="reftext">5</span>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,
<span class="reftext">6</span>being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart. For in my chains and in my <span class='spell ca'>defence</span><span class='spell gb'>defence</span><span class='spell us'>defense</span> and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partners in grace with me.
<span class="reftext">8</span>God is my witness how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,
<span class="reftext">10</span>so that you may be able to test and prove what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,
<span class="reftext">11</span>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s Trials Advance the Gospel<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(James 1:2–12)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Now I want you to know, brothers, that my circumstances have actually served to advance the gospel.
<span class="reftext">13</span>As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard<span class="fn">a</span>  and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And most of the brothers, confident in the Lord by my chains, now dare more greatly to speak the word<span class="fn">b</span>  without fear.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.
<span class="reftext">16</span>The latter do so in love, knowing that I am appointed for the <span class='spell ca'>defence</span><span class='spell gb'>defence</span><span class='spell us'>defense</span> of the gospel.<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">17</span>The former, however, preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can add to the distress of my chains.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>What then is the issue?<span class="fn">d</span>  Just this: that in every way, whether by false motives or true, Christ is preached. And in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,
<span class="reftext">19</span>because I know that through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, my distress will turn out for my deliverance.
<span class="reftext">20</span>I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have complete boldness so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.
</p><p class="hdg">To Live Is Christ</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
<span class="reftext">22</span>But if I go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> for me. So what shall I choose? I do not know.
<span class="reftext">23</span>I am torn between the two. I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better indeed.
<span class="reftext">24</span>But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,
<span class="reftext">26</span>so that through my coming to you again your exultation in Christ Jesus will resound on account of me.
</p><p class="hdg">Worthy of the Gospel</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Nevertheless, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending side by side<span class="fn">e</span>  for the faith of the gospel,
<span class="reftext">28</span>without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation, and it is from God.
<span class="reftext">29</span>For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him,
<span class="reftext">30</span>since you are encountering the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">all the Praetorium</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> NE and WH <i class="calibre6">the word of God</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">16</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> BYZ and TR reverse the order of verses 16 and 17.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">What then?</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">27</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">striving together with one mind</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
