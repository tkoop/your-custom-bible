</p><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Sower<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 13:1–23; Mark 4:1–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> told them this parable:
<span><span class="reftext">5</span>“A farmer went out to sow his seed. And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, where it was trampled, and the birds of the air devoured it.</span>
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">6</span>Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the seedlings withered because they had no moisture.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">7</span>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the seedlings.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">8</span>Still other seed fell on good soil, where it sprang up and produced a crop—a hundredfold.” </p><p class="reg1"> As Jesus said this, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> called out, <span>“He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples asked <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> what this parable meant.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>He replied, <span>“The knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been given to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, but to others I speak in parables, so that,</span> </p><p class="indent1stlinered">‘though seeing, they may not see; </p><p class="indentred"> though hearing, they may not understand.’<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now this is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.
<span class="reftext">12</span>The seeds<span class="fn">c</span>  along the path are those who hear, but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">13</span>The seeds on rocky ground are those who hear the word and receive it with joy, but they have no root. They believe for a season, but in the time of testing, they fall away.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">14</span>The seeds that fell among the thorns are those who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the worries, riches, and pleasures of this life, and their fruit does not mature.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">15</span>But the seeds on good soil are those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, cling to it, and by persevering produce a crop.
</p><p class="hdg">The Lesson of the Lamp<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Mark 4:21–25)</span></p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">16</span>No one lights a lamp and covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he sets it on a stand, so those who enter can see the light.
<span class="reftext">17</span>For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light.
</p><p class="calibre3"><span class="reftext">18</span>Pay attention, therefore, to how <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> listen. Whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus’ Mother and Brothers<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 12:46–50; Mark 3:31–35)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, but they were unable to reach <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> because of the crowd.
<span class="reftext">20</span>He was told, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>But <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> replied, <span>“My mother and brothers are those who hear the word of God and carry it out.”</span>
</p><p class="hdg">Jesus Calms the Storm<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Psalm 107:1–43; Matthew 8:23–27; Mark 4:35–41)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>One day Jesus said to <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> disciples, <span>“Let us cross to the other side of the lake.”</span> So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> got into a boat with them and set out.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>As they sailed, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> fell asleep, and a windstorm came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.
<span class="reftext">24</span>The disciples went and woke <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” </p><p class="reg1"> Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters, and they subsided, and all was calm.
<span><span class="reftext">25</span>“Where is <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> faith?”</span> He asked. </p><p class="reg1"> Frightened and amazed, they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>!”
</p><p class="hdg">The Demons and the Pigs<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 8:28–34; Mark 5:1–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes,<span class="fn">d</span>  across the lake from Galilee.
<span class="reftext">27</span>When Jesus stepped ashore, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothing or lived in a house, but he stayed in the tombs.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>When the man saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, shouting in a loud voice, “What do <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> want with me, Jesus, <span class='cap'>Son</span><span class='nocap'>son</span><span class='bsb'>Son</span> of the <span class='cap'>Most</span><span class='nocap'>most</span><span class='bsb'>Most</span> <span class='cap'>High</span><span class='nocap'>high</span><span class='bsb'>High</span> God? I beg <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span> not to torture me!”
<span class="reftext">29</span>For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and been driven by the demon into solitary places.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">30</span>“What is your name?”</span> Jesus asked. </p><p class="reg1">“Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him.
<span class="reftext">31</span>And the demons kept begging Jesus not to order them to go into the Abyss.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>There on the hillside a large herd of pigs was feeding. So the demons begged Jesus to let them enter the pigs, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> gave them permission.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">34</span>When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside.
<span class="reftext">35</span>So the people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man whom the demons had left, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
<span class="reftext">36</span>Meanwhile, those who had seen it reported how the demon-possessed man had been healed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">37</span>Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart from them, because great fear had taken hold of them. So <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> got into the boat and started back.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">38</span>The man whom the demons had left begged to go with Jesus. But <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> sent him away, saying,
<span><span class="reftext">39</span>“Return home and describe how much God has done for you.”</span> So the man went away and proclaimed all over the town how much Jesus had done for him.
</p><p class="hdg">The Healing Touch of Jesus<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Matthew 9:18–26; Mark 5:21–43)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">40</span>When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, for they had all been waiting for <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>.
<span class="reftext">41</span>Just then a synagogue leader named Jairus came and fell at Jesus’ feet. He begged <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> to come to his house,
<span class="reftext">42</span>because his only daughter, who was about twelve, was dying. </p><p class="reg1"> As Jesus went with him, the crowds pressed around <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>,
<span class="reftext">43</span>including a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years. She had spent all her money on physicians,<span class="fn">e</span>  but no one was able to heal her.
<span class="reftext">44</span>She came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe of <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span><span class='bsb'>His</span> cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">45</span>“Who touched <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>?”</span> Jesus asked. </p><p class="reg1"> But they all denied it. “Master,” said Peter,<span class="fn">f</span>  “the people are crowding and pressing against <span class='cap'>You</span><span class='nocap'>you</span><span class='bsb'>You</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>But Jesus declared, <span>“Someone touched <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>, for I know that power has gone out from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span><span class='bsb'>Me</span>.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>Then the woman, seeing that she could not escape notice, came trembling and fell down before <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>. In the presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> and how she had immediately been healed.
</p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">48</span>“Daughter,”</span> said Jesus, <span>“your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">49</span>While <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> was still speaking, someone arrived from the house of the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he told Jairus. “Do not bother the <span class='cap'>Teacher</span><span class='nocap'>teacher</span><span class='bsb'>Teacher</span> anymore.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>But Jesus overheard them and said to Jairus, <span>“Do not be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.”</span>
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">51</span>When <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> entered the house, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> did not allow anyone to go in with <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span> except Peter, John, James, and the child’s father and mother.
<span class="reftext">52</span>Meanwhile, everyone was weeping and mourning for her. But Jesus said, <span>“Stop weeping; she is not dead but asleep.”</span>
<span class="reftext">53</span>And they laughed at <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span><span class='bsb'>Him</span>, knowing that she was dead.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">54</span>But Jesus took her by the hand and called out, <span>“Child, get up!”</span>
<span class="reftext">55</span>Her spirit returned, and at once she got up. And <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span><span class='bsb'>He</span> directed that she be given something to eat.
<span class="reftext">56</span>Her parents were astounded, but Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">3</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> TR <i class="calibre6">to Him</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Isaiah 6:9 (See also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">12</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">the ones</i>; also in verses 13, 14, and 15<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">26</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> BYZ and TR <i class="calibre6">Gadarenes</i>; Tischendorf <i class="calibre6">Gergesenes</i>; also in verse 37<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">43</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> NE and WH do not include <i class="calibre6">She had spent all her money on physicians</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">45</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">and those who were with him</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
