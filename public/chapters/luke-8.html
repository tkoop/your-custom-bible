<font face="Tahoma, serif">Soon afterward, Jesus traveled from one
town and village to another, preaching and proclaiming the good news
of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with Him, as well as some
women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary
called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, Joanna the
wife of Herod’s household manager Chuza, Susanna, and many others.
These women were ministering to them out of their own means. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">While a large crowd was gathering and
people were coming to Jesus from town after town, He told them this
parable: <font color="#a80000">“A farmer went out to sow his seed.
And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, where it was
trampled, and the birds of the air devoured it.</font> </font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Other seed fell
among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the seedlings. </font></font>

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Still other seed
fell on good soil, where it sprang up and produced a crop—a

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As Jesus said this, He called out, <font color="#a80000">“He
who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</font> </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">

<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">Now this is the
meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. The seeds along
the path are those who hear, but the devil comes and takes away the
word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. </font></font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font color="#a80000"><font face="Tahoma, serif">The seeds on rocky

<font face="Tahoma, serif">One day Jesus said to His disciples, <font color="#a80000">“Let
us cross to the other side of the lake.”</font> So He got into a

<font face="Tahoma, serif">As they sailed, He fell asleep, and a
windstorm came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped,

saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and
the raging waters, and they subsided, and all was calm. <font color="#a80000">“Where

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then they sailed to the region of the
Gerasenes, across the lake from Galilee. When Jesus stepped ashore,
He was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time
this man had not worn clothing or lived in a house, but he stayed in
the tombs. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When the man saw Jesus, he cried out and
fell down before Him, shouting in a loud voice, “What do You want
with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You not to torture
me!” For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the
man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was bound with
chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and been driven by the
demon into solitary places. </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Legion,” he replied, because many
demons had gone into him. And the demons kept begging Jesus not to
order them to go into the Abyss. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">There on the hillside a large herd of pigs

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the demons came out of the man and
went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the
lake and was drowned. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When those tending the pigs saw what had
happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside.
So the people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus
and found the man whom the demons had left, sitting at Jesus’ feet,
clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Meanwhile, those
who had seen it reported how the demon-possessed man had been healed.

</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then all the people of the region of the
Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart from them, because great fear had
taken hold of them. So He got into the boat and started back. </font>

went away and proclaimed all over the town how much Jesus had done
for him. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed
Him, for they had all been waiting for Him. Just then a synagogue
leader named Jairus came and fell at Jesus’ feet. He begged Him to
come to his house, because his only daughter, who was about twelve,
was dying. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As Jesus went with him, the crowds pressed
around Him, including a woman who had suffered from bleeding for
twelve years. She had spent all her money on physicians, but no one
was able to heal her. She came up behind Jesus and touched the fringe
of His cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">But they all denied it. “Master,” said
Peter, “the people are crowding and pressing against You.” </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the woman, seeing that she could not
escape notice, came trembling and fell down before Him. In the
presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched Him and
how she had immediately been healed. </font>

<font face="Tahoma, serif">While He was still speaking, someone
arrived from the house of the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is

<font face="Tahoma, serif">When He entered the house, He did not
allow anyone to go in with Him except Peter, John, James, and the
child’s father and mother. Meanwhile, everyone was weeping and
mourning for her. But Jesus said, <font color="#a80000">“Stop
weeping; she is not dead but asleep.”</font> And they laughed at
Him, knowing that she was dead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jesus took her by the hand and called
out, <font color="#a80000">“Child, get up!”</font> Her spirit
returned, and at once she got up. And He directed that she be given
something to eat. Her parents were astounded, but Jesus ordered them
not to tell anyone what had happened. </font>
