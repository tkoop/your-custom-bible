<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Amaziah Reigns in Judah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 14:1–7)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem.
<span class="reftext">2</span>And he did what was right in the eyes of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, but not wholeheartedly.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, Amaziah executed the servants who had murdered his father the king.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Yet he did not put their sons to death, but acted according to what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> commanded: “Fathers must not be put to death for their children, and children must not be put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.”<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Amaziah’s Victories</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then Amaziah gathered the people of Judah and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and of hundreds. And he numbered those twenty years of age or older throughout Judah and Benjamin and found 300,000 chosen men able to serve in the army, bearing the spear and shield.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>He also hired 100,000 mighty warriors from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.<span class="fn">b</span> 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But a man of God came to him and said, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> is not with Israel—not with any of the Ephraimites.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Even if you go and fight bravely in battle, God will make you stumble before the enemy, for God has power to help and power to overthrow.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Amaziah asked the man of God, “What should I do about the hundred talents I have given to the army of Israel?” </p><p class="reg1"> And the man of God replied, “<span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> is able to give you much more than this.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. And they were furious with Judah and returned home in great anger.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Amaziah, however, summoned his strength and led his troops to the Valley of Salt, where he struck down 10,000 men of Seir,
<span class="reftext">12</span>and the army of Judah also captured 10,000 men alive. They took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had dismissed from battle raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon. They struck down 3,000 people and carried off a great deal of plunder.
</p><p class="hdg">Amaziah Rebuked for Idolatry</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>When Amaziah returned from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the Seirites, set them up as his own gods, bowed before them, and burned sacrifices to them.
<span class="reftext">15</span>Therefore the anger of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet, who said, “Why have you sought this people’s gods, which could not deliver them from your hand?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>While he was still speaking, the king asked, “Have we made you the <span class='spell ca'>counsellor</span><span class='spell gb'>counsellor</span><span class='spell us'>counselor</span> to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?” </p><p class="reg1"> So the prophet stopped, but he said, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my advice.”
</p><p class="hdg">Jehoash Defeats Amaziah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 14:8–14)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent word to the king of Israel Jehoash<span class="fn">c</span>  son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu. “Come, let us meet face to face,” he said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle.
<span class="reftext">19</span>You have said, ‘Look, I have defeated Edom,’ and your heart has become proud and boastful. Now stay at home. Why should you stir up trouble so that you fall—you and Judah with you?”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>But Amaziah would not listen, for this had come from God in order to deliver them into the hand of Jehoash, because they had sought the gods of Edom.
<span class="reftext">21</span>So Jehoash king of Israel advanced, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh in Judah.
<span class="reftext">22</span>And Judah was routed before Israel, and every man fled to his own home.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>There at Beth-shemesh, Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz.<span class="fn">d</span>  </p><p class="reg1"> Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section of four hundred cubits.<span class="fn">e</span> 
<span class="reftext">24</span>He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the house of God with Obed-edom and in the treasuries of the royal palace, as well as some hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.
</p><p class="hdg">The Death of Amaziah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 14:17–20)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
<span class="reftext">26</span>As for the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from beginning to end, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>From the time that Amaziah turned from following <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But men were sent after him to Lachish, and they killed him there.
<span class="reftext">28</span>They carried him back on horses and buried him with his fathers in the City of Judah.<span class="fn">f</span> </p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Deuteronomy 24:16<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> <i class="calibre6">100 talents</i> is approximately 3.77 tons or 3.42 metric tons of silver; also in verse 9.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">17</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> <i class="calibre6">Jehoash</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Joash</i>; also in verses 18, 21, 23, and 25.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> <i class="calibre6">Jehoahaz</i> is a variant of <i class="calibre6">Ahaziah</i>.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">23</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> <i class="calibre6">400 cubits</i> is approximately 600 feet or 182.9 meters.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">28</span> <span class="footnotesbot">f</span> Most Hebrew manuscripts; some Hebrew manuscripts, LXX, Vulgate, and Syriac <i class="calibre6">City of David</i>; see 2 Kings 14:20.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
