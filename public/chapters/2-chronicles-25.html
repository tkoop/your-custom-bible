Chronicles 25</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Jehoash Defeats Amaziah</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he
became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His
mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem. And he did
what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not wholeheartedly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his
grasp, Amaziah executed the servants who had murdered his father the
king. Yet he did not put their sons to death, but acted according to
what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD
commanded: “Fathers must not be put to death for their children,
and children must not be put to death for their fathers; each is to
die for his own sin.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Amaziah gathered the people of Judah
and assigned them according to their families to commanders of
thousands and of hundreds. And he numbered those twenty years of age
or older throughout Judah and Benjamin and found 300,000 chosen men
able to serve in the army, bearing the spear and shield. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He also hired 100,000 mighty warriors from
Israel for a hundred talents of silver. But a man of God came to him
and said, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for
the LORD is not with Israel—not with any of the Ephraimites. Even
if you go and fight bravely in battle, God will make you stumble
before the enemy, for God has power to help and power to overthrow.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Amaziah asked the man of God, “What
should I do about the hundred talents I have given to the army of
Israel?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the man of God replied, “The LORD is
able to give you much more than this.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had
come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. And they were furious
with Judah and returned home in great anger. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Amaziah, however, summoned his strength
and led his troops to the Valley of Salt, where he struck down 10,000
men of Seir, and the army of Judah also captured 10,000 men alive.
They took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all
were dashed to pieces. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had
dismissed from battle raided the cities of Judah, from Samaria to
Beth-horon. They struck down 3,000 people and carried off a great
deal of plunder. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Amaziah returned from the slaughter
of the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the Seirites, set them
up as his own gods, bowed before them, and burned sacrifices to them.
Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and He sent
him a prophet, who said, “Why have you sought this people’s gods,
which could not deliver them from your hand?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">While he was still speaking, the king
asked, “Have we made you the counselor to the king? Stop! Why be
struck down?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the prophet stopped, but he said, “I
know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done
this and have not heeded my advice.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel
and sent word to the king of Israel Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son
of Jehu. “Come, let us meet face to face,” he said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Jehoash king of Israel replied to
Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a
cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son in
marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the
thistle. You have said, ‘Look, I have defeated Edom,’ and your
heart has become proud and boastful. Now stay at home. Why should you
stir up trouble so that you fall—you and Judah with you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Amaziah would not listen, for this had
come from God in order to deliver them into the hand of Jehoash,
because they had sought the gods of Edom. So Jehoash king of Israel
advanced, and he and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at
Beth-shemesh in Judah. And Judah was routed before Israel, and every
man fled to his own home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">There at Beth-shemesh, Jehoash king of
Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of
Jehoahaz. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and
broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner
Gate—a section of four hundred cubits. He took all the gold and
silver and all the articles found in the house of God with Obed-edom
and in the treasuries of the royal palace, as well as some hostages.
Then he returned to Samaria. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived
for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of
Israel. As for the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from beginning to
end, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and
Israel? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">From the time that Amaziah turned from
following the LORD, a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem,
and he fled to Lachish. But men were sent after him to Lachish, and
they killed him there. They carried him back on horses and buried him
with his fathers in the City of Judah. </font>
