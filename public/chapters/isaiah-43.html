</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>When you pass through the waters, </p><p class="indent"> I will be with you; </p><p class="indent1"> and when you go through the rivers, </p><p class="indent"> they will not overwhelm you. </p><p class="indent1"> When you walk through the fire, </p><p class="indent"> you will not be scorched; </p><p class="indent"> the flames will not set you ablaze.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">3</span>For I am the LORD your God, </p><p class="indent"> the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; </p><p class="indent1"> I give Egypt for your ransom, </p><p class="indent"> Cush<span class="fn">a</span>  and Seba in your place.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Because you are precious and honoured in My sight, </p><p class="indent"> and because I love you, </p><p class="indent1"> I will give men in exchange for you </p><p class="indent"> and nations in place of your life.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">5</span>Do not be afraid, for I am with you; </p><p class="indent"> I will bring your offspring from the east </p><p class="indent"> and gather you from the west.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’ </p><p class="indent"> and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back!’ </p><p class="indent1"> Bring My sons from afar, </p><p class="indent"> and My daughters from the ends of the earth—
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>everyone called by My name and created for My glory, </p><p class="indent"> whom I have indeed formed and made.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">8</span>Bring out a people who have eyes but are blind, </p><p class="indent"> and who have ears but are deaf.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>All the nations gather together </p><p class="indent"> and the peoples assemble. </p><p class="indent1"> Who among them can declare this, </p><p class="indent"> and proclaim to us the former things? </p><p class="indent1"> Let them present their witnesses to vindicate them, </p><p class="indent"> so that others may hear and say, “It is true.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>“You are My witnesses,” declares the LORD, </p><p class="indent">“and My servant whom I have chosen, </p><p class="indent1"> so that you may consider and believe Me </p><p class="indent"> and understand that I am He. </p><p class="indent1"> Before Me no god was formed, </p><p class="indent"> and after Me none will come.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>I, yes I, am the LORD, </p><p class="indent"> and there is no Savior but Me.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>I alone decreed and saved and proclaimed—</p><p class="indent"> I, and not some foreign god among you. </p><p class="indent1"> So you are My witnesses,” declares the LORD, </p><p class="indent">“that I am God.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Even from eternity I am He, </p><p class="indent"> and none can deliver out of My hand. </p><p class="indent"> When I act, who can reverse it?”
</p><p class="hdg">A Way in the Wilderness</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thus says the LORD your Redeemer, </p><p class="indent"> the Holy One of Israel: </p><p class="indent1stline">“For your sake, I will send to Babylon </p><p class="indent"> and bring them all as fugitives, </p><p class="indent1"> even the Chaldeans,<span class="fn">b</span>  </p><p class="indent"> in the ships in which they rejoice.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>I am the LORD, your Holy One, </p><p class="indent"> the Creator of Israel, and your King.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in the sea </p><p class="indent"> and a path through the surging waters,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>who brings out the chariots and horses, </p><p class="indent"> the armies and warriors together, </p><p class="indent1"> to lie down, never to rise again; </p><p class="indent"> to be extinguished, snuffed out like a wick:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">18</span>“Do not call to mind the former things; </p><p class="indent"> pay no attention to the things of old.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Behold, I am about to do something new; </p><p class="indent"> even now it is coming. Do you not see it? </p><p class="indent1"> Indeed, I will make a way in the wilderness </p><p class="indent"> and streams in the desert.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>The beasts of the field will honour Me, </p><p class="indent"> the jackals<span class="fn">c</span>  and the ostriches,<span class="fn">d</span>  </p><p class="indent1"> because I provide water in the wilderness </p><p class="indent"> and rivers in the desert, </p><p class="indent"> to give drink to My chosen people.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>The people I formed for Myself </p><p class="indent"> will declare My praise.
