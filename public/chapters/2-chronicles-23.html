<font ><b>Jehoiada Restores the Worship of the
LORD</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada
strengthened himself and made a covenant with the commanders of
hundreds—with Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan,
Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of
Zichri. So they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites from
all the cities of Judah and the heads of the families of Israel. And
when they came to Jerusalem, the whole assembly made a covenant with
the king in the house of God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Behold, the king’s son!” said
Jehoiada. “He must reign, just as the LORD promised concerning the
descendants of David. This is what you are to do: A third of you
priests and Levites who come on duty on the Sabbath shall keep watch
at the doors, a third shall be at the royal palace, and a third at
the Foundation Gate, while all the others are in the courtyards of
the house of the LORD. No one is to enter the house of the LORD
except the priests and those Levites who serve; they may enter
because they are consecrated, but all the people are to obey the
requirement of the LORD. The Levites must surround the king with
weapons in hand, and anyone who enters the temple must be put to
death. You must stay close to the king wherever he goes.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the Levites and all Judah did
everything that Jehoiada the priest had ordered. Each of them took
his men—those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off
duty—for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.
Then Jehoiada the priest gave to the commanders of hundreds the
spears and the large and small shields of King David that were in the
house of God. He stationed all the troops, with their weapons in
hand, surrounding the king by the altar and the temple, from the
south side to the north side of the temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehoiada and his sons brought out the
king’s son, put the crown on him, presented him with the Testimony,
and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted, “Long live
the king!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Athaliah heard the noise of the
people running and cheering the king, she went out to them in the
house of the LORD. And she looked out and saw the king standing by
his pillar at the entrance. The officers and trumpeters were beside
the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing
trumpets, while the singers with musical instruments were leading the
praises. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Athaliah tore her clothes and
screamed, “Treason, treason!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Jehoiada the priest sent out the
commanders of hundreds in charge of the army, saying, “Bring her
out between the ranks, and put to the sword anyone who follows her.”
For the priest had said, “She must not be put to death in the house
of the LORD.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they seized Athaliah as she reached the
entrance of the Horse Gate to the palace grounds, and there they put
her to death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jehoiada made a covenant between
himself and the king and the people that they would be the LORD’s
people. So all the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it
down. They smashed the altars and idols to pieces and killed Mattan
the priest of Baal in front of the altars. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Moreover, Jehoiada put the oversight of
the house of the LORD into the hands of the Levitical priests, whom
David had appointed over the house of the LORD, to offer burnt
offerings to the LORD as is written in the Law of Moses, with
rejoicing and song, as ordained by David. He stationed gatekeepers at
the gates of the house of the LORD, so that nothing unclean could
enter for any reason. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He also took with him the commanders of
hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people, and all the people of
the land, and they brought the king down from the house of the LORD
and entered the royal palace through the Upper Gate. They seated King
Joash on the royal throne, and all the people of the land rejoiced.
And the city was quiet, because Athaliah had been put to the sword. </font>
