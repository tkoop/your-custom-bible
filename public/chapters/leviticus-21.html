<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to
Aaron’s sons, the priests, and tell them that a priest is not to
defile himself for a dead person among his people, except for his
immediate family—his mother, father, son, daughter, or brother, or
his unmarried sister who is near to him, since she has no husband. He
is not to defile himself for those related to him by marriage, and so
profane himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Priests must not make bald spots on their
heads, shave off the edges of their beards, or make cuts in their
bodies. They must be holy to their God and not profane the name of
their God. Because they present to the LORD the offerings made by
fire, the food of their God, they must be holy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">A priest must not marry a woman defiled by
prostitution or divorced by her husband, for the priest is holy to
his God. You are to regard him as holy, since he presents the food of
your God. He shall be holy to you, because I the LORD am holy—I who
set you apart. If a priest’s daughter defiles herself by
prostituting herself, she profanes her father; she must be burned in
the fire. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The priest who is highest among his
brothers, who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and has
been ordained to wear the priestly garments, must not let his hair
hang loose or tear his garments. He must not go near any dead body;
he must not defile himself, even for his father or mother. He must
not leave or desecrate the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration
of the anointing oil of his God is on him. I am the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The woman he marries must be a virgin. He
is not to marry a widow, a divorced woman, or one defiled by
prostitution. He is to marry a virgin from his own people, so that he
does not defile his offspring among his people, for I am the LORD who
sanctifies him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to
Aaron, ‘For the generations to come, none of your descendants who
has a physical defect may approach to offer the food of his God. </font>

man who is blind, lame, disfigured, or deformed; no man who has a

<font face="Tahoma, serif">No descendant of Aaron the priest who has
a defect shall approach to present the offerings made by fire to the
LORD. Since he has a defect, he is not to come near to offer the food
of his God. He may eat the most holy food of his God as well as the
holy food, but because he has a defect, he must not go near the veil
or approach the altar, so as not to desecrate My sanctuaries. For I
am the LORD who sanctifies them.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
