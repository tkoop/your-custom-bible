<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Futility of Life</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>There is another evil I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavily upon mankind:
<span class="reftext">2</span>God gives a man riches, wealth, and <span class='spell ca'>honour</span><span class='spell gb'>honour</span><span class='spell us'>honor</span>, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires; but God does not allow him to enjoy them. Instead, a stranger will enjoy them. This is futile and a grievous affliction.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>A man may father a hundred children and live for many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he is unsatisfied with his prosperity and does not even receive a proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.
<span class="reftext">4</span>For a stillborn child enters in futility and departs in darkness, and his name is shrouded in obscurity.
<span class="reftext">5</span>The child, though neither seeing the sun nor knowing anything, has more rest than that man,
<span class="reftext">6</span>even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">7</span>All a man’s <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span> is for his mouth, </p><p class="indent"> yet his appetite is never satisfied.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>What advantage, then, has the wise man over the fool? What gain comes to the poor man who knows how to conduct himself before others?
<span class="reftext">9</span>Better what the eye can see than the wandering of desire. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Whatever exists was named long ago, and what happens to a man is foreknown; but he cannot contend with one stronger than he.
<span class="reftext">11</span>For the more words, the more futility—and how does that profit anyone?
<span class="reftext">12</span>For who knows what is good for a man during the few days in which he passes through his fleeting life like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will come after him under the sun?</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">filled</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
