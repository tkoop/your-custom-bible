<font ><b>Garments for the Priests</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Next, have your brother Aaron brought
to you from among the Israelites, along with his sons Nadab, Abihu,
Eleazar, and Ithamar, to serve Me as priests. Make holy garments for
your brother Aaron, to give him glory and splendor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are to instruct all the skilled
craftsmen, whom I have filled with a spirit of wisdom, to make
garments for Aaron’s consecration, so that he may serve Me as
priest. These are the garments that they shall make: a breastpiece,
an ephod, a robe, a woven tunic, a turban, and a sash. They are to
make these holy garments for your brother Aaron and his sons, so that
they may serve Me as priests. They shall use gold, along with blue,
purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >They are to make the ephod of finely spun
linen embroidered with gold, and with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.
It shall have two shoulder pieces attached at two of its corners, so
it can be fastened. And the skillfully woven waistband of the ephod
must be of one piece, of the same workmanship—with gold, with blue,
purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely spun linen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Take two onyx stones and engrave on them
the names of the sons of Israel: six of their names on one stone and
the remaining six on the other, in the order of their birth. Engrave
the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones the way a gem
cutter engraves a seal. Then mount the stones in gold filigree
settings. Fasten both stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as
memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Aaron is to bear their names
on his two shoulders as a memorial before the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Fashion gold filigree settings and two
chains of pure gold, made of braided cord work; and attach these
chains to the settings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are also to make a breastpiece of
judgment with the same workmanship as the ephod. Construct it with
gold, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and with finely spun
linen. It must be square when folded over double, a span long and a
span wide. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And mount on it a setting of gemstones,
four rows of stones: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.4cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >In the first row there shall be a ruby, a
topaz, and an emerald; </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >in the second row a turquoise, a sapphire,
and a diamond; </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >in the third row a jacinth, an agate, and
an amethyst; </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; margin-bottom: 0.26cm">
<font >and in the fourth row a beryl, an onyx,
and a jasper. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Mount these stones in gold filigree
settings. The twelve stones are to correspond to the names of the
sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the
twelve tribes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >For the breastpiece, make braided chains
like cords of pure gold. You are also to make two gold rings and
fasten them to the two corners of the breastpiece. Then fasten the
two gold chains to the two gold rings at the corners of the
breastpiece, and fasten the other ends of the two chains to the two
filigree settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod
at the front. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make two more gold rings and attach them
to the other two corners of the breastpiece, on the inside edge next
to the ephod. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make two additional gold rings and attach
them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, on its
front, near its seam just above its woven waistband. The rings of the
breastpiece shall be tied to the rings of the ephod with a cord of
blue yarn, so that the breastpiece is above the waistband of the
ephod and does not swing out from the ephod. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Whenever Aaron enters the Holy Place, he
shall bear the names of the sons of Israel over his heart on the
breastpiece of judgment, as a continual reminder before the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And place the Urim and Thummim in the
breastpiece of judgment, so that they will also be over Aaron’s
heart whenever he comes before the LORD. Aaron will continually carry
the judgment of the sons of Israel over his heart before the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are to make the robe of the ephod
entirely of blue cloth, with an opening at its top in the center.
Around the opening shall be a woven collar with an opening like that
of a garment, so that it will not tear. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make pomegranates of blue, purple, and
scarlet yarn all the way around the lower hem, with gold bells
between them, alternating the gold bells and pomegranates around the
lower hem of the robe. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Aaron must wear the robe whenever he
ministers, and its sound will be heard when he enters or exits the
sanctuary before the LORD, so that he will not die. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are to make a plate of pure gold and
engrave on it as on a seal: </font>
</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; text-transform: uppercase">
<font >HOLY TO THE LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Fasten to it a blue cord to mount it on
the turban; it shall be on the front of the turban. And it will be
worn on Aaron’s forehead, so that he may bear the iniquity of the
holy things that the sons of Israel consecrate with regard to all
their holy gifts. It shall always be on his forehead, so that they
may be acceptable before the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You are to weave the tunic with fine
linen, make the turban of fine linen, and fashion an embroidered
sash. Make tunics, sashes, and headbands for Aaron’s sons, to give
them glory and splendor. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After you put these garments on your
brother Aaron and his sons, anoint them, ordain them, and consecrate
them so that they may serve Me as priests. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Make linen undergarments to cover their
bare flesh, extending from waist to thigh. Aaron and his sons must
wear them whenever they enter the Tent of Meeting or approach the
altar to minister in the Holy Place, so that they will not incur
guilt and die. This is to be a permanent statute for Aaron and his
descendants. </font>
