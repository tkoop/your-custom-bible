</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; </p><p class="indent"> she has also set her table.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>She has sent out her maidservants; </p><p class="indent"> she calls out from the heights of the city.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” </p><p class="indent"> she says to him who lacks judgment.
