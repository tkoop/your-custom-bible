</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>To Timothy, my true child in the faith: </p><p class="reg1"> Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
</p><p class="hdg">Correcting False Teachers<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Titus 1:10–16)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>As I urged you on my departure to Macedonia, you should stay on at Ephesus to instruct certain men not to teach false doctrines
<span class="reftext">4</span>or devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculation rather than the stewardship of God’s work, which is by faith.<span class="fn">a</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>The goal of our instruction is the love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere faith.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Some have strayed from these ways and turned aside to empty talk.
<span class="reftext">7</span>They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they are saying or that which they so confidently assert.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it legitimately.
<span class="reftext">9</span>We realize that law is not enacted for the righteous, but for the lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinful, for the unholy and profane, for killers of father or mother, for murderers,
<span class="reftext">10</span>for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave traders<span class="fn">b</span>  and liars and perjurers, and for anyone else who is averse to sound teaching
<span class="reftext">11</span>that agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.
</p><p class="hdg">God’s Grace to Paul</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, that He considered me faithful and appointed me to service.
<span class="reftext">13</span>I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man; yet because I had acted in ignorance and unbelief, I was shown mercy.
<span class="reftext">14</span>And the grace of our Lord overflowed to me, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>This is a trustworthy saying, worthy of full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the worst.
<span class="reftext">16</span>But for this very reason I was shown mercy, so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display His perfect patience as an example to those who would believe in Him for eternal life.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Now to the King eternal, immortal, and invisible, the only God, be honour and glory forever and ever. Amen.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Timothy, my child, I entrust you with this command in keeping with the previous prophecies about you, so that by them you may fight the good fight,
<span class="reftext">19</span>holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and thereby shipwrecked their faith.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">rather than the stewardship of God in faith</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">for kidnappers</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre8"><p class="cross">(Home)</p></div></div>
