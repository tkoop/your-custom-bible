<font >Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the

<font >To Timothy, my true child in the faith: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Grace, mercy, and peace from God the
Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As I urged you on my departure to
Macedonia, you should stay on at Ephesus to instruct certain men not
to teach false doctrines or devote themselves to myths and endless
genealogies, which promote speculation rather than the stewardship of
Godâ€™s work, which is by faith. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The goal of our instruction is the love
that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and a sincere
faith. Some have strayed from these ways and turned aside to empty
talk. They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand
what they are saying or that which they so confidently assert. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now we know that the law is good, if one
uses it legitimately. We realize that law is not enacted for the
righteous, but for the lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and
sinful, for the unholy and profane, for killers of father or mother,
for murderers, for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave
traders and liars and perjurers, and for anyone else who is averse to
sound teaching that agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed
God, with which I have been entrusted. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has
strengthened me, that He considered me faithful and appointed me to
service. I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent
man; yet because I had acted in ignorance and unbelief, I was shown
mercy. And the grace of our Lord overflowed to me, along with the
faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is a trustworthy saying, worthy of
full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of
whom I am the worst. But for this very reason I was shown mercy, so
that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display His
perfect patience as an example to those who would believe in Him for
eternal life. Now to the King eternal, immortal, and invisible, the
only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. </font>

<font >Timothy, my child, I entrust you with this
command in keeping with the previous prophecies about you, so that by
them you may fight the good fight, holding on to faith and a good
conscience, which some have rejected and thereby shipwrecked their
faith. Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed
over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme. </font>
