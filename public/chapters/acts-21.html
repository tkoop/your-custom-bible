<font ><b>Paul’s Journey to Jerusalem</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After we had torn ourselves away from
them, we sailed directly to Cos, and the next day on to Rhodes, and
from there to Patara. Finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we
boarded it and set sail. After sighting Cyprus and passing south of
it, we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre, where the ship was to
unload its cargo. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We sought out the disciples in Tyre and
stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit they kept telling
Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. But when our time there had ended, we
set out on our journey. All the disciples, with their wives and
children, accompanied us out of the city and knelt down on the beach
to pray with us. And after we had said our farewells, we went aboard
the ship, and they returned home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When we had finished our voyage from Tyre,
we landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed with
them for a day. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Leaving the next day, we went on to
Caesarea and stayed at the home of Philip the evangelist, who was one
of the Seven. He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After we had been there several days, a
prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. Coming over to us, he took
Paul’s belt, bound his own feet and hands, and said, “The Holy
Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews of Jerusalem will bind the owner
of this belt and hand him over to the Gentiles.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to
go up to Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Paul answered, “Why are you weeping
and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to
die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” When he would not
be dissuaded, we fell silent and said, “The Lord’s will be done.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After these days, we packed up and went on
to Jerusalem. Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us, and
they took us to stay at the home of Mnason the Cypriot, an early
disciple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers
welcomed us joyfully. The next day Paul went in with us to see James,
and all the elders were present. Paul greeted them and recounted one
by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his
ministry. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When they heard this, they glorified God.
Then they said to Paul, “You see, brother, how many thousands of
Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law. But they
are under the impression that you teach all the Jews who live among
the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their
children or observe our customs. What then should we do? They will
certainly hear that you have come. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore do what we advise you. There are
four men with us who have taken a vow. Take these men, purify
yourself along with them, and pay their expenses so they can have
their heads shaved. Then everyone will know that there is no truth to
these rumors about you, but that you also live in obedience to the
law. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the Gentile believers, we have
written to them our decision that they must abstain from food
sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals,
and from sexual immorality.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the next day Paul took the men and
purified himself along with them. Then he entered the temple to give
notice of the date when their purification would be complete and the
offering would be made for each of them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the seven days were almost over, some
Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred
up the whole crowd and seized him, crying out, “Men of Israel, help
us! This is the man who teaches everywhere against our people and
against our law and against this place. Furthermore, he has brought
Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place.” For they had
previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they
assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The whole city was stirred up, and the
people rushed together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the
temple, and at once the gates were shut. While they were trying to
kill him, the commander of the Roman regiment received a report that
all Jerusalem was in turmoil. Immediately he took some soldiers and
centurions and ran down to the crowd. When the people saw the
commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The commander came up and arrested Paul,
ordering that he be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was
and what he had done. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Some in the crowd were shouting one thing,
and some another. And since the commander could not get at the truth
because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be brought into the
barracks. When Paul reached the steps, he had to be carried by the
soldiers because of the violence of the mob. For the crowd that
followed him kept shouting, “Away with him!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As they were about to take Paul into the
barracks, he asked the commander, “May I say something to you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Do you speak Greek?” he replied.
“Aren’t you the Egyptian who incited a rebellion some time ago
and led four thousand members of the ‘Assassins’ into the
wilderness?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But Paul answered, “I am a Jew from
Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Now I beg you to
allow me to speak to the people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Having received permission, Paul stood on
the steps and motioned to the crowd. A great hush came over the
crowd, and he addressed them in Hebrew: </font>
