<font ><b>Offerings for Priests and Levites</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the LORD said to Aaron, “You and your
sons and your father’s house must bear the iniquity involving the
sanctuary. And you and your sons alone must bear the iniquity
involving your priesthood. But bring with you also your brothers from
the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may join you
and assist you and your sons before the Tent of the Testimony. And
they shall attend to your duties and to all the duties of the Tent;
but they must not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary or
the altar, or both they and you will die. They are to join you and
attend to the duties of the Tent of Meeting, doing all the work at
the Tent; but no outsider may come near you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And you shall attend to the duties of the
sanctuary and of the altar, so that wrath may not fall on the
Israelites again. Behold, I Myself have selected your fellow Levites
from the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD to
perform the service for the Tent of Meeting. But only you and your
sons shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the
altar and what is inside the veil, and you are to perform that
service. I am giving you the work of the priesthood as a gift, but
any outsider who comes near the sanctuary must be put to death.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Aaron, “Behold, I
have put you in charge of My offerings. As for all the sacred
offerings of the Israelites, I have given them to you and your sons
as a portion and a permanent statute. A portion of the most holy
offerings reserved from the fire will be yours. From all the
offerings they render to Me as most holy offerings, whether grain
offerings or sin offerings or guilt offerings, that part belongs to
you and your sons. You are to eat it as a most holy offering, and
every male may eat it. You shall regard it as holy. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And this is yours as well: the offering of
their gifts, along with all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I
have given this to you and your sons and daughters as a permanent
statute. Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat
it. I give you all the freshest olive oil and all the finest new wine
and grain that the Israelites give to the LORD as their firstfruits.
The firstfruits of everything in their land that they bring to the
LORD will belong to you. Every ceremonially clean person in your
household may eat them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Every devoted thing in Israel belongs to
you. The firstborn of every womb, whether man or beast, that is
offered to the LORD belongs to you. But you must surely redeem every
firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals. You are to
pay the redemption price for a month-old male according to your
valuation: five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel,
which is twenty gerahs. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But you must not redeem the firstborn of
an ox, a sheep, or a goat; they are holy. You are to sprinkle their
blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire, a
pleasing aroma to the LORD. And their meat belongs to you, just as
the breast and right thigh of the wave offering belong to you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All the holy offerings that the Israelites
present to the LORD I give to you and to your sons and daughters as a
permanent statute. It is a permanent covenant of salt before the LORD
for you and your offspring.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You will
have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any portion
among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the
Israelites. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Behold, I have given to the Levites all
the tithes in Israel as an inheritance in return for the work they
do, the service of the Tent of Meeting. No longer may the Israelites
come near to the Tent of Meeting, or they will incur guilt and die. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Levites are to perform the work of the
Tent of Meeting, and they must bear their iniquity. This is a
permanent statute for the generations to come. The Levites will not
receive an inheritance among the Israelites. For I have given to the
Levites as their inheritance the tithe that the Israelites present to
the LORD as a contribution. That is why I told them that they would
not receive an inheritance among the Israelites.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD instructed Moses, “Speak to
the Levites and tell them: ‘When you receive from the Israelites
the tithe that I have given you as your inheritance, you must present
part of it as an offering to the LORD—a tithe of the tithe. Your
offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or
juice from the winepress. So you are to present an offering to the
LORD from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites, and from
these you are to give the LORD’s offering to Aaron the priest. You
must present the offering due the LORD from all the best of every
gift, the holiest part of it.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Therefore say to the Levites, ‘When you
have presented the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the
produce of the threshing floor or winepress. And you and your
households may eat the rest of it anywhere; it is the compensation
for your work at the Tent of Meeting. Once you have presented the
best part of it, you will not incur guilt because of it. But you must
not defile the sacred offerings of the Israelites, or else you will
die.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>” </font>
