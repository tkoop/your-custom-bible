<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of
Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges, and
officers of Israel, and they presented themselves before God. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And Joshua said to all the people, “This
is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Long ago your fathers,
including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the
Euphrates and worshiped other gods. But I took your father Abraham
from beyond the Euphrates and led him through all the land of Canaan,
and I multiplied his descendants. I gave him Isaac, and to Isaac I
gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau Mount Seir to possess, but Jacob and
his sons went down to Egypt. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I
afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and afterward I brought
you out. When I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you reached the
Red Sea, the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far
as the Red Sea. So your fathers cried out to the LORD, and He put
darkness between you and the Egyptians, over whom He brought the sea
and engulfed them. Your very eyes saw what I did to the Egyptians.
Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Later, I brought you to the land of the
Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan. They fought against you, but I
delivered them into your hand, that you should possess their land
when I destroyed them before you. Then Balak son of Zippor, the king
of Moab, set out to fight against Israel. He sent for Balaam son of
Beor to curse you, but I would not listen to Balaam. So he blessed
you again and again, and I delivered you from his hand. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After this, you crossed the Jordan and
came to Jericho. The people of Jericho fought against you, as did the
Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and
Jebusites, and I delivered them into your hand. I sent the hornet
ahead of you, and it drove out the two Amorite kings before you, but
not by your own sword or bow. So I gave you a land on which you did
not toil and cities that you did not build, and now you live in them
and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve
Him in sincerity and truth; cast aside the gods your fathers served
beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. But if it is
unpleasing in your sight to serve the LORD, then choose for
yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your
fathers served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in
whose land you are living. As for me and my house, we will serve the
LORD!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The people replied, “Far be it from us
to forsake the LORD to serve other gods! For the LORD our God brought
us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
slavery, and performed these great signs before our eyes. He also
protected us throughout our journey and among all the nations through
which we traveled. And the LORD drove out before us all the nations,
including the Amorites who lived in the land. We too will serve the
LORD, because He is our God!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">But Joshua said to the people, “You are
not able to serve the LORD, for He is a holy God; He is a jealous
God; He will not forgive your rebellion or your sins. If you forsake
the LORD and serve foreign gods, He will turn and bring disaster on
you and consume you, even after He has been good to you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">No!” replied the people. “We will
serve the LORD!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Joshua told them, “You are
witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the LORD.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">We are witnesses!” they said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now, therefore,” he said, “get rid
of the foreign gods among you and incline your hearts to the LORD,
the God of Israel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the people said to Joshua, “We will
serve the LORD our God and obey His voice.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">On that day Joshua made a covenant for the
people, and there at Shechem he established for them a statute and
ordinance. Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of
God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak
that was near the sanctuary of the LORD. And Joshua said to all the
people, “You see this stone. It will be a witness against us, for
it has heard all the words the LORD has spoken to us, and it will be
a witness against you if you ever deny your God.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Joshua sent the people away, each to
his own inheritance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Some time later, Joshua son of Nun, the
servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110. And they buried him in
the land of his inheritance, at Timnath-serah in the hill country of
Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. Israel had served the LORD throughout
the days of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had
experienced all the works that the LORD had done for Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the bones of Joseph, which the
Israelites had brought up out of Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the
plot of land that Jacob had purchased from the sons of Hamor,
Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver. So it became an
inheritance for Joseph’s descendants. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Eleazar son of Aaron also died, and they
buried him at Gibeah, which had been given to his son Phinehas in the
hill country of Ephraim. </font>
