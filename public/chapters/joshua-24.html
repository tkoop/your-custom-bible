</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>And Joshua said to all the people, “This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘Long ago <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates<span class="fn">a</span>  and worshiped other gods.
<span class="reftext">3</span>But I took your father Abraham from beyond the Euphrates and led him through all the land of Canaan, and I multiplied his descendants. I gave him Isaac,
<span class="reftext">4</span>and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau Mount Seir to possess, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and afterward I brought you out.
<span class="reftext">6</span>When I brought <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers out of Egypt and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> reached the Red <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span>,<span class="fn">b</span>  the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far as the Red <span class='cap'>Sea</span><span class='nocap'>sea</span>.
<span class="reftext">7</span>So <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers cried out to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, and <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> put darkness between <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and the Egyptians, over whom <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> brought the sea and engulfed them. <span class='youpl' data-word='Your'>Your</span> very eyes saw what I did to the Egyptians. Then <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> lived in the wilderness for a long time.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Later, I brought <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> to the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan. They fought against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, but I delivered them into your hand, that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> should possess their land when I destroyed them before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, set out to fight against Israel. He sent for Balaam son of Beor to curse <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>,
<span class="reftext">10</span>but I would not listen to Balaam. So he blessed you again and again, and I delivered <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> from his hand.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>After this, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The people of Jericho fought against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, as did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I delivered them into your hand.
<span class="reftext">12</span>I sent the hornet ahead of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and it drove out the two Amorite kings before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, but not by your own sword or bow.
<span class="reftext">13</span>So I gave <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> a land on which you did not toil and cities that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> did not build, and now <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> did not plant.’
</p><p class="hdg">Choose Whom You Will Serve<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Deuteronomy 10:12–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Now, therefore, fear <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and serve <span class='cap'>Him</span><span class='nocap'>him</span> in sincerity and truth; cast aside the gods <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers served beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">15</span>But if it is unpleasing in <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sight to serve <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, then choose for yourselves this day whom <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will serve, whether the gods <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> fathers served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> are living. As for me and my house, we will serve <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>The people replied, “Far be it from us to forsake <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> to serve other gods!
<span class="reftext">17</span>For <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God brought us and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, and performed these great signs before our eyes.

<span class="reftext">18</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites who lived in the land.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>But Joshua said to the people, “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are not able to serve <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, for <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is a holy God; <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> is a jealous God; <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will not forgive your rebellion or <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> sins.
<span class="reftext">20</span>If <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> forsake <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and serve foreign gods, <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> will turn and bring disaster on <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> and consume <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, even after <span class='cap'>He</span><span class='nocap'>he</span> has been good to <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>“No!” replied the people. “We will serve <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then Joshua told them, “<span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are witnesses against yourselves that <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have chosen to serve <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.” </p><p class="reg1">“We are witnesses!” they said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">23</span>“Now, therefore,” he said, “get rid of the foreign gods among you and incline your hearts to <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>So the people said to Joshua, “We will serve <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> our God and obey <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> voice.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he established for them a statute and ordinance.
<span class="reftext">26</span>Joshua recorded these things in the <span class='cap'>Book</span><span class='nocap'>book</span> of the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak<span class="fn">c</span>  that was near the sanctuary of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>.
<span class="reftext">27</span>And Joshua said to all the people, “You see this stone. It will be a witness against us, for it has heard all the words <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> has spoken to us, and it will be a witness against <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> if <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> ever deny <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> God.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.
