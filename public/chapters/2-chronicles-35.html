<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Josiah celebrated the Passover to the
LORD in Jerusalem, and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the
fourteenth day of the first month. He appointed the priests to their
duties and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">To the Levites who taught all Israel and
were holy to the LORD, Josiah said: “Put the holy ark in the temple
built by Solomon son of David king of Israel. It is not to be carried
around on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and His people
Israel. Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions, according
to the instructions written by David king of Israel and Solomon his
son. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Moreover, stand in the Holy Place by the
divisions of the families of your kinsmen the lay people, and by the
divisions of the families of the Levites. Slaughter the Passover
lambs, consecrate yourselves, and make preparations for your fellow
countrymen to carry out the word of the LORD given by Moses.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">From his own flocks and herds Josiah
contributed 30,000 lambs and goats plus 3,000 bulls for the Passover
offerings for all the people who were present. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">His officials also contributed willingly
to the people and priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and
Jehiel, the administrators of the house of God, gave the priests
2,600 Passover offerings and 300 bulls. Additionally, Conaniah and
his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and
Jozabad, officers of the Levites, donated to the Levites 5,000
Passover offerings and 500 bulls. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the service was prepared; the priests
stood in their places and the Levites in their divisions according to
the king’s command. And they slaughtered the Passover lambs, while
the priests sprinkled the blood handed to them and the Levites
skinned the animals. They set aside the burnt offerings to be given
to the divisions of the families of the people to offer to the LORD,
as is written in the Book of Moses; and they did the same with the
bulls. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">They roasted the Passover animals on the
fire according to the regulation, and they boiled the other holy
offerings in pots, kettles, and bowls and quickly brought them to all
the people. Afterward, they made preparations for themselves and for
the priests, since the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were
offering up burnt offerings and fat until nightfall. So the Levites
made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants
of Aaron. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The singers, the descendants of Asaph,
were at their stations according to the command of David, Asaph,
Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer. And the gatekeepers at each
gate did not need to leave their position, because their fellow
Levites made preparations for them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So on that day the entire service of the
LORD was carried out for celebrating the Passover and offering burnt
offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King
Josiah. The Israelites who were present also observed the Passover at
that time, as well as the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
No such Passover had been observed in Israel since the days of Samuel
the prophet. None of the kings of Israel ever observed a Passover
like the one that Josiah observed with the priests, the Levites, all
Judah, the Israelites who were present, and the people of Jerusalem.
In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, this Passover was
observed. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After all this, when Josiah had set the
temple in order, Neco king of Egypt marched up to fight at Carchemish
by the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to confront him. But Neco sent
messengers to him, saying, “What is the issue between you and me, O
king of Judah? I have not come against you today, but I am fighting
another dynasty. God told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is
with me, or He will destroy you!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Josiah, however, did not turn away from
him; instead, in order to engage him in battle, he disguised himself.
He did not listen to Neco’s words from the mouth of God, but went
to fight him on the Plain of Megiddo. There the archers shot King
Josiah, who said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am badly
wounded!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So his servants took him out of his
chariot, put him in his second chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem,
where he died. And Josiah was buried in the tomb of his fathers, and
all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Jeremiah lamented over Josiah, and to
this day all the choirs of men and women sing laments over Josiah.
They established them as a statute for Israel, and indeed they are
written in the Book of Laments. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">As for the rest of the acts of Josiah,
along with his deeds of loving devotion according to what is written
in the Law of the LORD— his acts from beginning to end—they are
indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. </font>
