</p><p class="tab1stlinered"><span class="reftext">2</span>I know your deeds, your <span class='spell ca'>labour</span><span class='spell gb'>labour</span><span class='spell us'>labor</span>, and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate those who are evil, and you have tested and exposed as liars those who falsely claim to be apostles.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Without growing weary, you have persevered and endured many things for the sake of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> name.
</p><p class="tab1stlinered"><span class="reftext">4</span>But I have this against you: You have abandoned your first love.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Therefore, keep in mind how far you have fallen. Repent and perform the deeds <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> did at first. But if you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
</p><p class="tab1stlinered"><span class="reftext">6</span>But you have this to your credit: You hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

</p><p class="tab1stlinered"><span class="reftext">9</span>I know your affliction and your poverty—though you are rich! And I am aware of the slander of those who falsely claim to be Jews, but are in fact a synagogue of Satan.
</p><p class="tab1stlinered"><span class="reftext">10</span>Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Look, the devil is about to throw some of <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> into prison to test <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>, and <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> will suffer tribulation for ten days.

</p><p class="tab1stlinered"><span class="reftext">14</span>But I have a few things against you, because some of you hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to place a stumbling block before the Israelites so they would eat food sacrificed to idols and commit sexual immorality.
<span class="reftext">15</span>In the same way, some of you also hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
<span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore repent! Otherwise I will come to you shortly and wage war against them with the sword of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> mouth.

<span class="reftext">21</span>Even though I have given her time to repent of her immorality, she is unwilling.
