<font ><b>Hezekiah’s Illness and Recovery</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After all these acts of faithfulness,
Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to
the fortified cities, intending to conquer them for himself. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had
come to make war against Jerusalem, he consulted with his leaders and
commanders about stopping up the waters of the springs outside the
city, and they helped him carry it out. Many people assembled and
stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the
land. “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of
water?” they said. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Hezekiah worked resolutely to rebuild
all the broken sections of the wall and to raise up towers on it. He
also built an outer wall and reinforced the supporting terraces of
the City of David, and he produced an abundance of weapons and
shields. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Hezekiah appointed military commanders
over the people and gathered the people in the square of the city
gate. Then he encouraged them, saying, “Be strong and courageous!
Do not be afraid or discouraged before the king of Assyria and the
vast army with him, for there is a greater One with us than with him.
With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to
help us and to fight our battles.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the people were strengthened by the
words of Hezekiah king of Judah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Later, as Sennacherib king of Assyria and
all his forces besieged Lachish, he sent his servants to Jerusalem
with a message for King Hezekiah of Judah and all the people of Judah
who were in Jerusalem: “This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria
says: What is the basis of your confidence, that you remain in
Jerusalem under siege? Is not Hezekiah misleading you to give you
over to death by famine and thirst when he says, ‘The LORD our God
will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?’ Did not
Hezekiah himself remove His high places and His altars and say to
Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before one altar, and on it
you shall burn sacrifices’? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Do you not know what I and my fathers have
done to all the peoples of the lands? Have the gods of these nations
ever been able to deliver their land from my hand? Who among all the
gods of these nations that my fathers devoted to destruction has been
able to deliver his people from my hand? How then can your God
deliver you from my hand? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive you,
and do not let him mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no
god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from
my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God
deliver you from my hand!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the servants of Sennacherib spoke
further against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah. He
also wrote letters mocking the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying
against Him: “Just as the gods of the nations did not deliver their
people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His
people from my hand.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Assyrians called out loudly in
Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten
and terrify them in order to capture the city. They spoke against the
God of Jerusalem as they had spoken against the gods of the peoples
of the earth—the work of human hands. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In response, King Hezekiah and the prophet
Isaiah son of Amoz cried out to heaven in prayer, and the LORD sent
an angel who annihilated every mighty man of valor and every leader
and commander in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he withdrew to
his own land in disgrace. And when he entered the temple of his god,
some of his own sons struck him down with the sword. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the people
of Jerusalem from the hands of King Sennacherib of Assyria and all
the others, and He gave them rest on every side. Many brought
offerings to Jerusalem for the LORD and valuable gifts for Hezekiah
king of Judah, and from then on he was exalted in the eyes of all
nations. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In those days Hezekiah became mortally
ill. So he prayed to the LORD, who spoke to him and gave him a sign.
But because his heart was proud, Hezekiah did not repay the favor
shown to him. Therefore wrath came upon him and upon Judah and
Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Hezekiah humbled the pride of his
heart—he and the people of Jerusalem—so that the wrath of the
LORD did not come upon them during the days of Hezekiah. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Hezekiah had very great riches and honor,
and he made treasuries for his silver, gold, precious stones, spices,
shields, and all kinds of valuable articles. He also made storehouses
for the harvest of grain and new wine and oil, stalls for all kinds
of livestock, and pens for the flocks. He made cities for himself,
and he acquired herds of sheep and cattle in abundance, for God gave
him very great wealth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper
outlet of the Spring of Gihon and channeled it down to the west side
of the City of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all that he did. And
so when ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon were sent to him to
inquire about the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him
alone to test him, that He might know all that was in Hezekiah’s
heart. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As for the rest of the acts of Hezekiah
and his deeds of loving devotion, they are indeed written in the
vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the Book of the Kings of
Judah and Israel. And Hezekiah rested with his fathers and was buried
in the upper tombs of David’s descendants. All Judah and the people
of Jerusalem paid him honor at his death. And his son Manasseh
reigned in his place. </font>
