<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Sennacherib Invades Judah<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 18:13–16; Psalm 46:1–11)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>After all these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, intending to conquer them for himself.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come to make war against Jerusalem,
<span class="reftext">3</span>he consulted with his leaders and commanders about stopping up the waters of the springs outside the city, and they helped him carry it out.
<span class="reftext">4</span>Many people assembled and stopped up all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. “Why should the kings<span class="fn">a</span>  of Assyria come and find plenty of water?” they said.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then Hezekiah worked resolutely to rebuild all the broken sections of the wall and to raise up towers on it. He also built an outer wall and reinforced the supporting terraces<span class="fn">b</span>  of the City of David, and he produced an abundance of weapons and shields.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Hezekiah appointed military commanders over the people and gathered the people in the square of the city gate. Then he encouraged them, saying,
<span class="reftext">7</span>“Be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged before the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater One with us than with him.
<span class="reftext">8</span>With him is only the arm of flesh,<span class="fn">c</span>  but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles.” </p><p class="reg1"> So the people were strengthened by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.
</p><p class="hdg">Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 18:17–37; Isaiah 36:1–22)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Later, as Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces besieged Lachish, he sent his servants to Jerusalem with a message for King Hezekiah of Judah and all the people of Judah who were in Jerusalem:
<span class="reftext">10</span>“This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says: What is the basis of your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?
<span class="reftext">11</span>Is not Hezekiah misleading you to give you over to death by famine and thirst when he says, ‘The LORD our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?’
<span class="reftext">12</span>Did not Hezekiah himself remove His high places and His altars and say to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You must worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn sacrifices’?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands? Have the gods of these nations ever been able to deliver their land from my hand?
<span class="reftext">14</span>Who among all the gods of these nations that my fathers devoted to destruction<span class="fn">d</span>  has been able to deliver his people from my hand? How then can your God deliver you from my hand?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive you, and do not let him mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you from my hand!”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>And the servants of Sennacherib spoke further against the LORD God and against His servant Hezekiah.
<span class="reftext">17</span>He also wrote letters mocking the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying against Him: “Just as the gods of the nations did not deliver their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then the Assyrians called out loudly in Hebrew<span class="fn">e</span>  to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them in order to capture the city.
<span class="reftext">19</span>They spoke against the God of Jerusalem as they had spoken against the gods of the peoples of the earth—the work of human hands.
</p><p class="hdg">Jerusalem Delivered from the Assyrians<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 19:35–37; Isaiah 37:36–38)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>In response, King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out to heaven in prayer,
<span class="reftext">21</span>and the LORD sent an angel who annihilated every mighty man of valour and every leader and commander in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he entered the temple of his god, some of his own sons struck him down with the sword.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hands of King Sennacherib of Assyria and all the others, and He gave them rest on every side.
<span class="reftext">23</span>Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the LORD and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah, and from then on he was exalted in the eyes of all nations.
</p><p class="hdg">Hezekiah’s Illness and Recovery<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(2 Kings 20:1–11; Isaiah 38:1–8)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. So he prayed to the LORD, who spoke to him and gave him a sign.
<span class="reftext">25</span>But because his heart was proud, Hezekiah did not repay the favour shown to him. Therefore wrath came upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then Hezekiah humbled the pride of his heart—he and the people of Jerusalem—so that the wrath of the LORD did not come upon them during the days of Hezekiah.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>Hezekiah had very great riches and honour, and he made treasuries for his silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable articles.
<span class="reftext">28</span>He also made storehouses for the harvest of grain and new wine and oil, stalls for all kinds of livestock, and pens for the flocks.
<span class="reftext">29</span>He made cities for himself, and he acquired herds of sheep and cattle in abundance, for God gave him very great wealth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Spring of Gihon and channeled it down to the west side of the City of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all that he did.
<span class="reftext">31</span>And so when ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon were sent to him to inquire about the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him alone to test him, that He might know all that was in Hezekiah’s heart.
</p><p class="hdg">Hezekiah’s Death</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>As for the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of loving devotion, they are indeed written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
<span class="reftext">33</span>And Hezekiah rested with his fathers and was buried in the upper tombs of David’s descendants. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem paid him honour at his death. And his son Manasseh reigned in his place.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Hebrew; LXX and Syriac <i class="calibre6">king</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">the Millo</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">He has only the strength of his own flesh</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">14</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Forms of the Hebrew <i class="calibre6">cherem</i> refer to the giving over of things or persons to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Or <i class="calibre6">in the dialect of Judah</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
