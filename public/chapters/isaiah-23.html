</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Be silent, O dwellers of the coastland, </p><p class="indent"> you merchants of Sidon, </p><p class="indent"> whose traders have crossed the sea.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>On the great waters </p><p class="indent"> came the grain of Shihor; </p><p class="indent1"> the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre; </p><p class="indent"> she was the merchant of the nations.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Be ashamed, O Sidon, the stronghold of the sea, </p><p class="indent"> for the sea has spoken: </p><p class="indent1">“I have not been in labour </p><p class="indent"> or given birth. </p><p class="indent1"> I have not raised young men </p><p class="indent"> or brought up young women.”
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>When the report reaches Egypt, </p><p class="indent"> they will writhe in agony over the news of Tyre.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">6</span>Cross over to Tarshish; </p><p class="indent"> wail, O inhabitants of the coastland!
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Is this your jubilant city, </p><p class="indent"> whose origin is from antiquity, </p><p class="indent1"> whose feet have taken her </p><p class="indent"> to settle far away?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Who planned this against Tyre, </p><p class="indent"> the bestower of crowns, </p><p class="indent1"> whose traders are princes, </p><p class="indent"> whose merchants are renowned on the earth?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The LORD of Hosts planned it, </p><p class="indent"> to defile all its glorious beauty, </p><p class="indent"> to disgrace all the renowned of the earth.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Cultivate<span class="fn">d</span>  your land like the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish; </p><p class="indent"> there is no longer a harbour.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The LORD has stretched out His hand over the sea; </p><p class="indent"> He has made kingdoms tremble. </p><p class="indent1"> He has given a command </p><p class="indent"> that the strongholds of Canaan be destroyed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>He said, “You shall rejoice no more, </p><p class="indent"> O oppressed Virgin Daughter of Sidon. </p><p class="indent1"> Get up and cross over to Cyprus—</p><p class="indent"> even there you will find no rest.”
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">13</span>Look at the land of the Chaldeans<span class="fn">e</span>—</p><p class="indent"> a people now of no account. </p><p class="indent1"> The Assyrians destined it for the desert creatures; </p><p class="indent"> they set up their siege towers and stripped its palaces. </p><p class="indent"> They brought it to ruin.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">14</span>Wail, O ships of Tarshish, </p><p class="indent"> for your harbour has been destroyed!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years—the span of a king’s life. But at the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>“Take up your harp, </p><p class="indent"> stroll through the city, </p><p class="indent"> O forgotten harlot. </p><p class="indent1"> Make sweet melody, </p><p class="indent"> sing many a song, </p><p class="indent"> so you will be remembered.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>And at the end of seventy years, the LORD will restore Tyre. Then she will return to hire as a prostitute and sell herself to all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
<span class="reftext">18</span>Yet her profits and wages will be set apart to the LORD; they will not be stored or saved, for her profit will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothing.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">Wail, O fleet of trading ships</i>; also in verse 14<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Hebrew <i class="calibre6">Kittim</i>; also in verse 12<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">2</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> DSS and LXX; MT <i class="calibre6">whom the seafarers have enriched</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">10</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> DSS and some LXX manuscripts; MT <i class="calibre6">Overflow</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">13</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> That is, the Babylonians<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
