Samuel 17</b></font></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif"><b>Hushai’s Warning Saves David</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Furthermore, Ahithophel said to Absalom,
“Let me choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit
of David. I will attack him while he is weak and weary; I will throw
him into a panic, and all the people with him will flee; I will
strike down only the king and bring all the people back to you as a
bride returning to her husband. You seek the life of only one man;
then all the people will be at peace.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">This proposal seemed good to Absalom and
all the elders of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Absalom said, “Summon Hushai the
Archite as well, and let us hear what he too has to say.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Hushai came to Absalom, who told him,
“Ahithophel has spoken this proposal. Should we carry it out? If
not, what do you say?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Hushai replied, “This time the advice of
Ahithophel is not sound.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">He continued, “You know your father and
his men. They are mighty men, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of
her cubs. Moreover, your father is a man of war who will not spend
the night with the troops. Surely by now he is hiding in a cave or
some other location. If some of your troops fall first, whoever hears
of it will say, ‘There has been a slaughter among the troops who
follow Absalom.’ Then even the most valiant soldier with the heart
of a lion will melt with fear, because all Israel knows that your
father is a mighty man who has valiant men with him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Instead, I advise that all Israel from Dan
to Beersheba—a multitude like the sand on the seashore—be
gathered to you, and that you yourself lead them into battle. Then we
will attack David wherever we find him, and we will descend on him
like dew on the ground. And of all the men with him, not even one
will remain. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">If he retreats to a city, all Israel will
bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley
until not even a pebble can be found.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then Absalom and all the men of Israel
said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than that of
Ahithophel.” For the LORD had purposed to thwart the good counsel
of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the
priests, “This is what Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the
elders of Israel, and this is what I have advised. Now send quickly
and tell David, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords of the
wilderness, but be sure to cross over. Otherwise the king and all the
people with him will be swallowed up.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at
En-rogel, where a servant girl would come and pass along information
to them. They in turn would go and inform King David, for they dared
not be seen entering the city. But a young man did see them and told
Absalom. So the two left quickly and came to the house of a man in
Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into
it. Then the man’s wife took a covering and spread it over the
mouth of the well, scattering grain over it so nobody would know a
thing. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Absalom’s servants came to the
woman at the house, they asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">They have crossed over the brook,”
she replied. The men searched but did not find them, so they returned
to Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">After the men had gone, Ahimaaz and
Jonathan climbed up out of the well and went to inform King David,
saying, “Get up and cross over the river at once, for Ahithophel
has given this advice against you.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So David and all the people with him got
up and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, there was no one left who had
not crossed the Jordan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When Ahithophel saw that his advice had
not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in
his hometown. He put his affairs in order and hanged himself. So he
died and was buried in his father’s tomb. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom
crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. Absalom had appointed
Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man
named Ithra, the Ishmaelite who had married Abigail, the daughter of
Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab. So the Israelites
and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">When David came to Mahanaim, he was met by
Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, Machir son of
Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim. They
brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, as well as wheat, barley,
flour, roasted grain, beans, lentils, honey, curds, sheep, and cheese
from the herd for David and his people to eat. For they said, “The
people have become hungry, exhausted, and thirsty in the wilderness.”
