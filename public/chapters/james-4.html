<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Warning against Pride</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>What causes conflicts and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from the passions at war within you?<span class="fn">a</span> 
<span class="reftext">2</span>You crave what you do not have; you kill and covet, but are unable to obtain it. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.
<span class="reftext">3</span>And when you do ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may squander it on your pleasures.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>You adulteresses!<span class="fn">b</span>  Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore, whoever chooses to be a friend of the world renders himself<span class="fn">c</span>  an enemy of God.
<span class="reftext">5</span>Or do you think the Scripture says without reason that the Spirit<span class="fn">d</span>  He caused to dwell in us yearns with envy?
<span class="reftext">6</span>But He gives us more grace. This is why it says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“God opposes the proud, </p><p class="indent"> but gives grace to the humble.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">Drawing Near to God</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
<span class="reftext">8</span>Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
<span class="reftext">9</span>Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your laughter to mourning, and your joy to gloom.
<span class="reftext">10</span>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. And if you judge the law, you are not a practitioner of the law, but a judge of it.
<span class="reftext">12</span>There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbour?
</p><p class="hdg">Do Not Boast about Tomorrow<br class="calibre2"><span class="cross1">(Proverbs 27:1)</span></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business, and make a profit.”
<span class="reftext">14</span>You do not even know what will happen tomorrow! What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>Instead, you ought to say, “If the Lord is willing, we will live and do this or that.”
<span class="reftext">16</span>As it is, you boast in your proud intentions. All such boasting is evil.
<span class="reftext">17</span>Anyone, then, who knows the right thing to do, yet fails to do it, is guilty of sin.</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">passions warring among your members?</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> See Hosea 3:1.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">4</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">is appointed</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the spirit</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">e</span> Proverbs 3:34 (see also LXX)<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
