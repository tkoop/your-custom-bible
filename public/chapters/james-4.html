<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">What causes conflicts and quarrels among
you? Don’t they come from the passions at war within you? You crave
what you do not have; you kill and covet, but are unable to obtain
it. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.
And when you do ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong
motives, that you may squander it on your pleasures. </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">You adulteresses! Do you not know that
friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore, whoever
chooses to be a friend of the world renders himself an enemy of God.
Or do you think the Scripture says without reason that the Spirit He
caused to dwell in us yearns with envy? But He gives us more grace.
This is why it says: </font>

“<font face="Tahoma, serif">God opposes the proud, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">but gives grace to the humble.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist
the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and He will
draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your
hearts, you double-minded. Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your
laughter to mourning, and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before
the Lord, and He will exalt you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Brothers, do not slander one another.
Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against
the law and judges it. And if you judge the law, you are not a
practitioner of the law, but a judge of it. There is only one
Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and destroy. But who
are you to judge your neighbor? </font>

<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Come now, you who say, “Today or
tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry
on business, and make a profit.” You do not even know what will
happen tomorrow! What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a
little while and then vanishes. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Instead, you ought to say, “If the Lord
is willing, we will live and do this or that.” As it is, you boast
in your proud intentions. All such boasting is evil. Anyone, then,
who knows the right thing to do, yet fails to do it, is guilty of
sin. </font>
