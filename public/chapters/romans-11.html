<font ><b>A Remnant Chosen by Grace</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I ask then, did God reject His people?
Certainly not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham,
from the tribe of Benjamin. God did not reject His people, whom He
foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how
he appealed to God against Israel: “Lord, they have killed Your
prophets and torn down Your altars. I am the only one left, and they
are seeking my life as well”? </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And what was the divine reply to him? “I
have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the
knee to Baal.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >In the same way, at the present time there
is a remnant chosen by grace. And if it is by grace, then it is no
longer by works. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >What then? What Israel was seeking, it
failed to obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened, as it
is written: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >God gave them a spirit of stupor, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >eyes that could not see, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and ears that could not hear, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >to this very day.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And David says: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
“<font >May their table become a snare and a
trap, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >a stumbling block and a retribution to
them. </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >May their eyes be darkened so they cannot
see, </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.59cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font >and their backs be bent forever.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I ask then, did they stumble so as to fall
beyond recovery? Certainly not! However, because of their trespass,
salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous. But if
their trespass means riches for the world, and their failure means
riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness
bring! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as
I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry in the hope
that I may provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them.
For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will
their acceptance be but life from the dead? If the first part of the
dough is holy, so is the whole batch; if the root is holy, so are the
branches. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if some branches have been broken off,
and you, a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others to
share in the nourishment of the olive root, do not boast over those
branches. If you do, remember this: You do not support the root, but
the root supports you. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >You will say then, “Branches were broken
off so that I could be grafted in.” That is correct: They were
broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be
arrogant, but be afraid. For if God did not spare the natural
branches, He will certainly not spare you either. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Take notice, therefore, of the kindness
and severity of God: severity to those who fell, but kindness to you,
if you continue in His kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.
And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for
God is able to graft them in again. For if you were cut from a wild
olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into one that is
cultivated, how much more readily will these, the natural branches,
be grafted into their own olive tree! </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I do not want you to be ignorant of this
mystery, brothers, so that you will not be conceited: A hardening in
part has come to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has
come in. And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: </font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-right: 0.79cm; margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<p style="margin-left: 0.79cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<font >Regarding the gospel, they are enemies on
your account; but regarding election, they are loved on account of
the patriarchs. For God’s gifts and His call are irrevocable. </font>

<font >Just as you who formerly disobeyed God
have now received mercy through their disobedience, so they too have
now disobeyed, in order that they too may now receive mercy through
the mercy shown to you. For God has consigned everyone to
disobedience so that He may have mercy on everyone. </font>
