<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">A Remnant Chosen by Grace</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>I ask then, did God reject His people? Certainly not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
<span class="reftext">2</span>God did not reject His people, whom He foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how he appealed to God against Israel:
<span class="reftext">3</span>“Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well”<span class="fn">a</span>?
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>And what was the divine reply to him? “I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”<span class="fn">b</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>In the same way, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.
<span class="reftext">6</span>And if it is by grace, then it is no longer by works. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.<span class="fn">c</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>What then? What Israel was seeking, it failed to obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,
<span class="reftext">8</span>as it is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">“God gave them a spirit of stupor, </p><p class="indent"> eyes that could not see, </p><p class="indent"> and ears that could not hear, </p><p class="indent1"> to this very day.”<span class="fn">d</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>And David says: </p><p class="indent1stline">“May their table become a snare and a trap, </p><p class="indent"> a stumbling block and a retribution to them.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">10</span>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, </p><p class="indent"> and their backs be bent forever.”<span class="fn">e</span> 
</p><p class="hdg">The Ingrafting of the Gentiles</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>I ask then, did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery?<span class="fn">f</span>  Certainly not! However, because of their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous.
<span class="reftext">12</span>But if their trespass means riches for the world, and their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry
<span class="reftext">14</span>in the hope that I may provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them.
<span class="reftext">15</span>For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
<span class="reftext">16</span>If the first part of the dough is holy, so is the whole batch; if the root is holy, so are the branches.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Now if some branches have been broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others to share in the nourishment of the olive root,
<span class="reftext">18</span>do not boast over those branches. If you do, remember this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”
<span class="reftext">20</span>That is correct: They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.
<span class="reftext">21</span>For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will certainly not<span class="fn">g</span>  spare you either.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Take notice, therefore, of the kindness and severity of God: severity to those who fell, but kindness to you, if you continue in His kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.
<span class="reftext">23</span>And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
<span class="reftext">24</span>For if you were cut from a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into one that is cultivated, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!
</p><p class="hdg">All Israel Will Be Saved</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you will not be conceited: A hardening in part has come to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.
<span class="reftext">26</span>And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: </p><p class="indent1stline">“The Deliverer will come from Zion; </p><p class="indent"> He will remove godlessness from Jacob.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>And this is My covenant with them </p><p class="indent"> when I take away their sins.”<span class="fn">h</span> 
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>Regarding the gospel, they are enemies on your account; but regarding election, they are loved on account of the patriarchs.
<span class="reftext">29</span>For God’s gifts and His call are irrevocable.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">30</span>Just as you who formerly disobeyed God have now received mercy through their disobedience,
<span class="reftext">31</span>so they too have now disobeyed, in order that they too may now receive mercy through the mercy shown to you.<span class="fn">i</span> 
<span class="reftext">32</span>For God has consigned everyone to disobedience so that He may have mercy on everyone.
