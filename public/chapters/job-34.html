</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Hear my words, O wise men; </p><p class="indent"> give ear to me, O men of learning.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">3</span>For the ear tests words </p><p class="indent"> as the mouth tastes food.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Let us choose for ourselves what is right; </p><p class="indent"> let us learn together what is good.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">5</span>For Job has declared, ‘I am righteous, </p><p class="indent"> yet God has deprived me of justice.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Would I lie about my case? </p><p class="indent"> My wound is incurable, </p><p class="indent"> though I am without transgression.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">7</span>What man is like Job, </p><p class="indent"> who drinks up derision like water?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">8</span>He keeps company with evildoers </p><p class="indent"> and walks with wicked men.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">9</span>For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing </p><p class="indent"> that he should delight in God.’
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore listen to me, </p><p class="indent"> O men of understanding. </p><p class="indent1"> Far be it from God to do wrong, </p><p class="indent"> and from the Almighty to act unjustly.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">11</span>For according to a man’s deeds He repays him; </p><p class="indent"> according to a man’s ways He brings consequences.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly, </p><p class="indent"> and the Almighty does not pervert justice.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">13</span>Who gave Him charge over the earth? </p><p class="indent"> Who appointed Him over the whole world?
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">14</span>If He were to set His heart to it </p><p class="indent"> and withdraw His Spirit and breath,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">15</span>all flesh would perish together </p><p class="indent"> and mankind would return to the dust.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">16</span>If you have understanding, hear this; </p><p class="indent"> listen to my words.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Could one who hates justice govern? </p><p class="indent"> Will you condemn the just and mighty One,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">18</span>who says to kings, ‘You are worthless!’ </p><p class="indent"> and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">19</span>who is not partial to princes </p><p class="indent"> and does not favour rich over poor? </p><p class="indent"> For they are all the work of His hands.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">20</span>They die in an instant, </p><p class="indent"> in the middle of the night. </p><p class="indent1"> The people convulse and pass away; </p><p class="indent"> the mighty are removed without human hand.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">21</span>For His eyes are on the ways of a man, </p><p class="indent"> and He sees his every step.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">22</span>There is no darkness or deep shadow </p><p class="indent"> where the workers of iniquity can hide.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">23</span>For God need not examine a man further </p><p class="indent"> or have him approach for judgment.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">24</span>He shatters the mighty without inquiry </p><p class="indent"> and sets up others in their place.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Therefore, He recognizes their deeds; </p><p class="indent"> He overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">26</span>He strikes them for their wickedness </p><p class="indent"> in full view,
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">27</span>because they turned aside from Him </p><p class="indent"> and had no regard for any of His ways.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">28</span>They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him, </p><p class="indent"> and He heard the outcry of the afflicted.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">29</span>But when He remains silent, who can condemn Him? </p><p class="indent"> When He hides His face, who can see Him? </p><p class="indent1"> Yet He watches over both man and nation,
</p><p class="indent"><span class="reftext">30</span>that godless men should not rule </p><p class="indent"> or lay snares for the people.
</p><p class="indent1stline"><span class="reftext">31</span>Suppose someone says to God, </p><p class="indent">‘I have endured my punishment; I will offend no more.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">32</span>Teach me what I cannot see; </p><p class="indent"> if I have done wrong, I will not do it again.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">33</span>Should God repay you on your own terms </p><p class="indent"> when you have disavowed His? </p><p class="indent1"> You must choose, not I; </p><p class="indent"> so tell me what you know.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">34</span>Men of understanding will declare to me, </p><p class="indent"> and the wise men who hear me will say:
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">35</span>‘Job speaks without knowledge; </p><p class="indent"> his words lack insight.’
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">36</span>If only Job were tried to the utmost </p><p class="indent"> for answering like a wicked man.
</p><p class="indent1"><span class="reftext">37</span>For he adds rebellion to his sin; </p><p class="indent"> he claps his hands among us </p><p class="indent"> and multiplies his words against God.”</p></div><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
