<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Eighth Plague: Locusts</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">a</a></span>  his heart and the hearts of his officials, that I may perform these miraculous signs of Mine among them,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a><span class="reftext">2</span>and that you may tell your children and grandchildren how severely I dealt with the Egyptians when I performed miraculous signs among them, so that all of you may know that I am the LORD.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and told him, “This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a><span class="reftext">4</span>But if you refuse to let My people go, I will bring locusts into your territory tomorrow.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a><span class="reftext">5</span>They will cover the face of the land so that no one can see it. They will devour whatever is left after the hail and eat every tree that grows in your fields.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a><span class="reftext">6</span>They will fill your houses and the houses of all your officials and every Egyptian—something neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen since the day they came into this land.’<span class="thinq"> </span>” </p><p class="reg1"> Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh’s presence.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>Pharaoh’s officials asked him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is in ruins?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the LORD your God,” he said. “But who exactly will be going?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>“We will go with our young and old,” Moses replied. “We will go with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, for we must hold a feast to the LORD.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then Pharaoh told them, “May the LORD be with you if I ever let you go with your little ones. Clearly you are bent on evil.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a><span class="reftext">11</span>No, only the men may go and worship the LORD, since that is what you have been requesting.” And Moses and Aaron were driven from Pharaoh’s presence.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt, so that the locusts may swarm over it and devour every plant in the land—everything that the hail has left behind.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and throughout that day and night the LORD sent an east wind across the land. By morning the east wind had brought the locusts.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>The locusts swarmed across the land and settled over the entire territory of Egypt. Never before had there been so many locusts, and never again will there be.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a><span class="reftext">15</span>They covered the face of all the land until it was black, and they consumed all the plants on the ground and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left behind. Nothing green was left on any tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">16</span>Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a><span class="reftext">17</span>Now please forgive my sin once more and appeal to the LORD your God, that He may remove this death from me.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>So Moses left Pharaoh’s presence and appealed to the LORD.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a><span class="reftext">19</span>And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind that carried off the locusts and blew them into the Red Sea.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">b</a></span>  Not a single locust remained anywhere in Egypt.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">20</span>But the LORD hardened<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">c</a></span>  Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="21"></a></p><p class="hdg">The Ninth Plague: Darkness</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward heaven, so that darkness may spread over the land of Egypt—a palpable darkness.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and total darkness covered all the land of Egypt for three days.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="23"></a><span class="reftext">23</span>No one could see anyone else, and for three days no one left his place. Yet all the Israelites had light in their dwellings.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="24"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the LORD. Even your little ones may go with you; only your flocks and herds must stay behind.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>But Moses replied, “You must also provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="26"></a><span class="reftext">26</span>Even our livestock must go with us; not a hoof will be left behind, for we will need some of them to worship the LORD our God, and we will not know how we are to worship the LORD until we arrive.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="27"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was unwilling to let them go.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="28"></a><span class="reftext">28</span>“Depart from me!” Pharaoh said to Moses. “Make sure you never see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="29"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>“As you say,” Moses replied, “I will never see your face again.”</p></div><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">made heavy</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">19</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Sea of Reeds</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Or <i class="calibre6">stiffened</i> or <i class="calibre6">strengthened</i>; also in verse 27<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p>
