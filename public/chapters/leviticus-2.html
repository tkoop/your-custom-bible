<font ><b>Laws for Grain Offerings</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >When anyone brings a grain offering to
the LORD, his offering must consist of fine flour. He is to pour
olive oil on it, put frankincense on it, and bring it to Aaron’s
sons the priests. The priest shall take a handful of the flour and
oil, together with all the frankincense, and burn this as a memorial
portion on the altar, an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to
the LORD. The remainder of the grain offering shall belong to Aaron
and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to
the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now if you bring an offering of grain
baked in an oven, it must consist of fine flour, either unleavened
cakes mixed with oil or unleavened wafers coated with oil. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If your offering is a grain offering
prepared on a griddle, it must be unleavened bread made of fine flour
mixed with oil. Crumble it and pour oil on it; it is a grain
offering. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If your offering is a grain offering
cooked in a pan, it must consist of fine flour with oil. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When you bring to the LORD the grain
offering made in any of these ways, it is to be presented to the
priest, and he shall take it to the altar. The priest is to remove
the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar
as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. But the
remainder of the grain offering shall belong to Aaron and his sons;
it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >No grain offering that you present to the
LORD may be made with leaven, for you are not to burn any leaven or
honey as an offering made by fire to the LORD. You may bring them to
the LORD as an offering of firstfruits, but they are not to be
offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma. And you shall season each
of your grain offerings with salt. You must not leave the salt of the
covenant of your God out of your grain offering; you are to add salt
to each of your offerings. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >If you bring a grain offering of
firstfruits to the LORD, you shall offer crushed heads of new grain
roasted on the fire. And you are to put oil and frankincense on it;
it is a grain offering. The priest shall then burn the memorial
portion of the crushed grain and the oil, together with all its
frankincense, as an offering made by fire to the LORD. </font>
