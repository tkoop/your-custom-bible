He is to pour olive oil on it, put frankincense on it,
<span class="reftext">2</span>and bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests. The priest shall take a handful of the flour and oil, together with all the frankincense, and burn this as a memorial portion on the altar, an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
<span class="reftext">3</span>The remainder of the grain offering shall belong to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now if you bring an offering of grain baked in an oven, it must consist of fine flour, either unleavened cakes mixed with oil or unleavened wafers coated with oil.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>If your offering is a grain offering prepared on a griddle,<span class="fn">a</span>  it must be unleavened bread made of fine flour mixed with oil.
<span class="reftext">6</span>Crumble it and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>If your offering is a grain offering cooked in a pan,<span class="fn">b</span>  it must consist of fine flour with oil.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>When you bring to the LORD the grain offering made in any of these ways, it is to be presented to the priest, and he shall take it to the altar.
<span class="reftext">9</span>The priest is to remove the memorial portion from the grain offering and burn it on the altar as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
<span class="reftext">10</span>But the remainder of the grain offering shall belong to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings made by fire to the LORD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>No grain offering that you present to the LORD may be made with leaven, for you are not to burn any leaven or honey as an offering made by fire to the LORD.
<span class="reftext">12</span>You may bring them to the LORD as an offering of firstfruits, but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma.
<span class="reftext">13</span>And you shall season each of your grain offerings with salt. You must not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offering; you are to add salt to each of your offerings.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to the LORD, you shall offer crushed heads of new grain roasted on the fire.
<span class="reftext">15</span>And you are to put oil and frankincense on it; it is a grain offering.
<span class="reftext">16</span>The priest shall then burn the memorial portion of the crushed grain and the oil, together with all its frankincense, as an offering made by fire to the LORD.</p></div><div class='fn'><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">5</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> That is, a shallow pan for baking or frying<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> That is, a deep pan or stew pan<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
