<span class="reftext">2</span>And <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> said to me, “This gate is to remain shut. It shall not be opened, and no man shall enter through it, because <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, the God of Israel, has entered through it. Therefore it will remain shut.
<span class="reftext">3</span>Only the prince himself may sit inside the gateway to eat in the presence of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. He must enter by way of the portico of the gateway and go out the same way.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then the man brought me to the front of the temple by way of the north gate. I looked and saw the glory of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> filling <span class='cap'>His</span><span class='nocap'>his</span> temple, and I fell facedown.
<span class="reftext">5</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> said to me: “Son of man, pay attention; look carefully with your eyes and listen closely with your ears to everything I tell you concerning all the statutes and laws of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. Take careful note of the entrance to the temple, along with all the exits of the sanctuary.
</p><p class="hdg">Reproof of the Levites</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>Tell the rebellious house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘I have had enough of all <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> abominations, O house of Israel.
<span class="reftext">7</span>In addition to all <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> other abominations, <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> brought in foreigners uncircumcised in both heart and flesh to occupy <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sanctuary; you defiled <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> temple when <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> offered <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> food—the fat and the blood; <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> broke <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> covenant.
<span class="reftext">8</span>And <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> have not kept charge of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> holy things, but have appointed others to keep charge of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sanctuary for <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span>.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>This is what the Lord GOD says: No foreigner uncircumcised in heart and flesh may enter <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sanctuary—not even a foreigner who lives among the Israelites.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Surely the Levites who wandered away from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> when Israel went astray, and who wandered away from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> after their idols, will bear the consequences of their iniquity.
<span class="reftext">11</span>Yet they shall be ministers in <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sanctuary, having charge of the gates of the temple and ministering there. They shall slaughter the burnt offerings and other sacrifices for the people and stand before them to minister to them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Because they ministered before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I swore with an uplifted hand concerning them that they would bear the consequences of their iniquity, declares the Lord GOD.
<span class="reftext">13</span>They must not approach <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to serve <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> as priests or come near any of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> holy things or the most holy things. They will bear the shame of the abominations they have committed.
<span class="reftext">14</span>Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of all the work for the temple and everything to be done in it.
</p><p class="hdg">The Duties of the Priests</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>But the Levitical priests, who are descended from Zadok and who kept charge of <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>, are to approach <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span> to minister before <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.

<span class="reftext">16</span>They alone shall enter <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> sanctuary and draw near to <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> table to minister before <span class='cap'>Me</span><span class='nocap'>me</span>.

</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>When they go out to the outer court, to the people, they are to take off the garments in which they have ministered, leave them in the holy chambers, and dress in other clothes so that they do not transmit holiness to the people with their garments.

<span class="reftext">21</span>No priest may drink wine before he enters the inner court.
<span class="reftext">22</span>And they shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman, but must marry a virgin of the descendants of the house of Israel, or a widow of a priest.
<span class="reftext">23</span>They are to teach <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> people the difference between the holy and the common, and show them how to discern between the clean and the unclean.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>In any dispute, they shall officiate as judges and judge according to <span class='cap'>My</span><span class='nocap'>my</span> ordinances.

<span class="reftext">27</span>And on the day he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he must present his sin offering, declares the Lord GOD.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>In regard to their inheritance, I am their inheritance. <span class='youpl' data-word='You'>You</span> are to give them no possession in Israel, for I am their possession.
