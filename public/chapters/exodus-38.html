<font ><b>An Inventory of Materials</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Bezalel constructed the altar of burnt
offering from acacia wood. It was square, five cubits long, five
cubits wide, and three cubits high. He made a horn at each of its
four corners, so that the horns and altar were of one piece, and he
overlaid the altar with bronze. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >He made all the altar’s utensils of
bronze—its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks, and
firepans. He made a grate of bronze mesh for the altar under its
ledge, halfway up from the bottom. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >At the four corners of the bronze grate he
cast four rings as holders for the poles. And he made the poles of
acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. Then he inserted the poles
into the rings on the sides of the altar for carrying it. He made the
altar with boards so that it was hollow. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Next he made the bronze basin and its
stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the
Tent of Meeting. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then he constructed the courtyard. The
south side of the courtyard was a hundred cubits long and had
curtains of finely spun linen, with twenty posts and twenty bronze
bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts. The north side
was also a hundred cubits long, with twenty posts and twenty bronze
bases. The hooks and bands of the posts were silver. The west side
was fifty cubits long and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases.
The hooks and bands of the posts were silver. And the east side,
toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits long. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The curtains on one side of the entrance
were fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases. And the
curtains on the other side were also fifteen cubits long, with three
posts and three bases as well. All the curtains around the courtyard
were made of finely spun linen. The bases for the posts were bronze,
the hooks and bands were silver, and the plating for the tops of the
posts was silver. So all the posts of the courtyard were banded with
silver. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The curtain for the entrance to the
courtyard was embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and
finely spun linen. It was twenty cubits long and, like the curtains
of the courtyard, five cubits high, with four posts and four bronze
bases. Their hooks were silver, as well as the bands and the plating
of their tops. All the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the
surrounding courtyard were bronze. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is the inventory for the tabernacle,
the tabernacle of the Testimony, as recorded at Moses’ command by
the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made
everything that the LORD had commanded Moses. With him was Oholiab
son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, designer, and
embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All the gold from the wave offering used
for the work on the sanctuary totaled 29 talents and 730 shekels,
according to the sanctuary shekel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The silver from those numbered among the
congregation totaled 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the
sanctuary shekel— a beka per person, that is, half a shekel,
according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone twenty years of age
or older who had crossed over to be numbered, a total of 603,550 men.
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The hundred talents of silver were used to
cast the bases of the sanctuary and the bases of the veil—100 bases
from the 100 talents, one talent per base. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >With the 1,775 shekels of silver he made
the hooks for the posts, overlaid their tops, and supplied bands for
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The bronze from the wave offering totaled
70 talents and 2,400 shekels. He used it to make the bases for the
entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar and its bronze
grating, all the utensils for the altar, the bases for the
surrounding courtyard and its gate, and all the tent pegs for the
tabernacle and its surrounding courtyard. </font>
