<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">The Broken Jar</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> says: “Go and buy a clay jar from a potter. Take some of the elders of the people and leaders of the priests,
<span class="reftext">2</span>and go out to the Valley of Ben-hinnom near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. </p><p class="reg1"> Proclaim there the words I speak to you,
<span class="reftext">3</span>saying, ‘Hear the word of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, O kings of Judah and residents of Jerusalem. This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am going to bring such disaster on this place that the ears of all who hear of it will ring,
<span class="reftext">4</span>because they have abandoned Me and made this a foreign place. They have burned incense in this place to other gods that neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have ever known. They have filled this place with the blood of the innocent.
<span class="reftext">5</span>They have built high places to Baal on which to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I never commanded or mentioned, nor did it even enter My mind.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>So behold, the days are coming, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
<span class="reftext">7</span>And in this place I will ruin<span class="fn">a</span>  the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hands of those who seek their lives, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>I will make this city a desolation and an object of scorn.<span class="fn">b</span>  All who pass by will be appalled and will scoff at all her wounds.
<span class="reftext">9</span>I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh in the siege and distress inflicted on them by their enemies who seek their lives.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then you are to shatter the jar in the presence of the men who accompany you,
<span class="reftext">11</span>and you are to proclaim to them that this is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts says: I will shatter this nation and this city, like one shatters a potter’s jar that can never again be repaired. They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room to bury them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>This is what I will do to this place and to its residents, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>. I will make this city like Topheth.
<span class="reftext">13</span>The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like that place, Topheth—all the houses on whose rooftops they burned incense to all the host of heaven and poured out drink offerings to other gods.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth, where <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the courtyard of the house of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> and proclaimed to all the people,
<span class="reftext">15</span>“This is what <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I am about to bring on this city and on all the villages around it every disaster I have pronounced against them, because they have stiffened their necks so as not to heed My words.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">7</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> The Hebrew term for <i class="calibre6">ruin</i> sounds like the Hebrew for <i class="calibre6">jar</i>; see verses 1 and 10.<p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">8</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">and a hissing</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
