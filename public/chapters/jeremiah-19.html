<font ><b>The Broken Jar</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what the LORD says: “Go and buy
a clay jar from a potter. Take some of the elders of the people and
leaders of the priests, and go out to the Valley of Ben-hinnom near
the entrance of the Potsherd Gate. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Proclaim there the words I speak to you,
saying, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and residents
of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel,
says: I am going to bring such disaster on this place that the ears
of all who hear of it will ring, because they have abandoned Me and
made this a foreign place. They have burned incense in this place to
other gods that neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah
have ever known. They have filled this place with the blood of the
innocent. They have built high places to Baal on which to burn their
children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I never
commanded or mentioned, nor did it even enter My mind. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So behold, the days are coming, declares
the LORD, when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the
Valley of Ben-hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. And in this place
I will ruin the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall
by the sword before their enemies, by the hands of those who seek
their lives, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds of
the air and the beasts of the earth. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I will make this city a desolation and an
object of scorn. All who pass by will be appalled and will scoff at
all her wounds. I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and
daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh in the siege and
distress inflicted on them by their enemies who seek their lives.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then you are to shatter the jar in the
presence of the men who accompany you, and you are to proclaim to
them that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: I will shatter this
nation and this city, like one shatters a potter’s jar that can
never again be repaired. They will bury the dead in Topheth until
there is no more room to bury them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >This is what I will do to this place and
to its residents, declares the LORD. I will make this city like
Topheth. The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah
will be defiled like that place, Topheth—all the houses on whose
rooftops they burned incense to all the host of heaven and poured out
drink offerings to other gods.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth, where
the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the courtyard of
the house of the LORD and proclaimed to all the people, “This is
what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I am
about to bring on this city and on all the villages around it every
disaster I have pronounced against them, because they have stiffened
their necks so as not to heed My words.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
