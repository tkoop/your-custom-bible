<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<font ><b>Samuel Anoints Saul</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Samuel took a flask of oil, poured it
on Saul’s head, kissed him, and said, “Has not the LORD anointed
you ruler over His inheritance? When you leave me today, you will
find two men at Rachel’s tomb in Zelzah on the border of Benjamin.
They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you seek have been found, and
now your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and started
worrying about you, asking, “What should I do about my son?”<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>’
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then you will go on from there until you
come to the Oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will
meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying
three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine. They will
greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you will accept
from their hands. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After that you will come to Gibeah of God,
where the Philistines have an outpost. As you approach the city, you
will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place,
preceded by harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres, and they will be
prophesying. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the Spirit of the LORD will rush upon
you, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be transformed
into a different person. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When these signs have come, do as the
occasion demands, for God is with you. And you shall go before me to
Gilgal, and surely I will come to you to offer burnt offerings and to
sacrifice peace offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and
show you what you are to do.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God
changed Saul’s heart, and all the signs came to pass that day. When
Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him.
Then the Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied along with
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >All those who had formerly known Saul and
saw him prophesying with the prophets asked one another, “What has
happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then a man who lived there replied, “And
who is their father?” So the saying became a proverb: “Is Saul
also among the prophets?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And when Saul had finished prophesying, he
went up to the high place. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Now Saul’s uncle asked him and his
servant, “Where did you go?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >To look for the donkeys,” Saul
replied. “When we saw they were not to be found, we went to
Samuel.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Tell me,” Saul’s uncle asked, “what
did Samuel say to you?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And Saul replied, “He assured us that
the donkeys had been found.” But Saul did not tell his uncle what
Samuel had said about the kingship. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After this, Samuel summoned the people to
the LORD at Mizpah and said to the Israelites, “This is what the
LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt,
and I rescued you from the hands of the Egyptians and of all the
kingdoms that oppressed you.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But today you have rejected your God, who
saves you from all your troubles and afflictions, and you have said
to Him, ‘No, set a king over us.’ Now therefore present
yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus Samuel had all the tribes of Israel
come forward, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected. Then he had the
tribe of Benjamin come forward by its clans, and the clan of Matri
was selected. Finally, Saul son of Kish was selected. But when they
looked for him, they could not find him. So again they inquired of
the LORD, “Has the man come here yet?” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And the LORD replied, “Behold, he has
hidden himself among the baggage.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So they ran and brought Saul, and when he
stood among the people, he was a head taller than any of the others.
Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the one the LORD has
chosen? There is no one like him among all the people.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >And all the people shouted, “Long live
the king!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Samuel explained to the people the
rights of kingship. He wrote them on a scroll and laid it up before
the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, each to his own home. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, and
the men of valor whose hearts God had touched went with him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >But some worthless men said, “How can
this man save us?” So they despised him and brought him no gifts;
but Saul remained silent about it. </font>
