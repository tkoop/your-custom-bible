<font >Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual
blessing in the heavenly realms. For He chose us in Him before the
foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in His presence. In
love He predestined us for adoption as His sons through Jesus Christ,
according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of His
glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the Beloved One. </font>

<font >In Him we have redemption through His
blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of
His grace that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.
And He has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His
good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ as a plan for the fullness
of time, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together in
Christ. </font>

<font >In Him we were also chosen as God’s own,
having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out
everything by the counsel of His will, in order that we, who were the
first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of His glory. </font>

the promised Holy Spirit, who is the pledge of our inheritance until
the redemption of those who are God’s possession, to the praise of
His glory. </font>

your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, I have
not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,

you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in your knowledge of Him. </font>

<font >I ask that the eyes of your heart may be
enlightened, so that you may know the hope of His calling, the riches
of His glorious inheritance in the saints, and the surpassing
greatness of His power to us who believe. These are in accordance
with the working of His mighty strength, which He exerted in Christ
when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in
the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority, power and
dominion, and every name that is named, not only in the present age
but also in the one to come. </font>

fullness of Him who fills all in all. </font>
