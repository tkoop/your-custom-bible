<span class="reftext">4</span>For He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in His presence. In love
<span class="reftext">5</span>He predestined us for adoption as His sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will,
<span class="reftext">6</span>to the praise of His glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the Beloved One.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace
<span class="reftext">8</span>that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.
<span class="reftext">9</span>And He has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ
<span class="reftext">10</span>as a plan for the fullness of time, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together in Christ.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>In Him we were also chosen as God’s own, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything by the counsel of His will,
<span class="reftext">12</span>in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of His glory.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>And in Him, having heard and believed the word of truth—the gospel of your salvation—you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
<span class="reftext">14</span>who is the pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession, to the praise of His glory.

<span class="reftext">16</span>I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,
<span class="reftext">17</span>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in your knowledge of Him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>I ask that the eyes of your heart<span class="fn">b</span>  may be enlightened, so that you may know the hope of His calling, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints,

<span class="reftext">20</span>which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms,
<span class="reftext">21</span>far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.
