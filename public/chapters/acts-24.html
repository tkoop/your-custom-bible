<font ><b>Tertullus Prosecutes Paul</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Five days later the high priest Ananias
came down with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, who
presented to the governor their case against Paul. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When Paul had been called in, Tertullus
opened the prosecution: “Because of you, we have enjoyed a lasting
peace, and your foresight has brought improvements to this nation. In
every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this
with all gratitude. But in order not to burden you any further, I beg
your indulgence to hear us briefly. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >We have found this man to be a pestilence,
stirring up dissension among the Jews all over the world. He is a
ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes, and he even tried to
desecrate the temple; so we seized him. By examining him yourself,
you will be able to learn the truth about all our charges against
him.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The Jews concurred, asserting that these
charges were true. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >When the governor motioned for Paul to
speak, he began his response: “Knowing that you have been a judge
over this nation for many years, I gladly make my defense. You can
verify for yourself that no more than twelve days ago I went up to
Jerusalem to worship. Yet my accusers did not find me debating with
anyone in the temple or riling up a crowd in the synagogues or in the
city. Nor can they prove to you any of their charges against me. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >I do confess to you, however, that I
worship the God of our fathers according to the Way, which they call
a sect. I believe everything that is laid down by the Law and written
in the Prophets, and I have the same hope in God that they themselves
cherish, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and
the wicked. In this hope, I strive always to maintain a clear
conscience before God and man. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After several years, then, I returned to
Jerusalem to bring alms to my people and to present offerings. At the
time they found me in the temple, I was ceremonially clean and was
not inciting a crowd or an uproar. But there are some Jews from the
province of Asia who ought to appear before you and bring charges, if
they have anything against me. Otherwise, let these men state for
themselves any crime they found in me when I stood before the
Sanhedrin, unless it was this one thing I called out as I stood in
their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that
I am on trial before you today.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then Felix, who was well informed about
the Way, adjourned the hearing and said, “When Lysias the commander
comes, I will decide your case.” He ordered the centurion to keep
Paul under guard, but to allow him some freedom and permit his
friends to minister to his needs. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After several days, Felix returned with
his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to
him speak about faith in Christ Jesus. As Paul expounded on
righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became
frightened and said, “You may go for now. When I find the time, I
will call for you.” At the same time, he was hoping that Paul would
offer him a bribe. So he sent for Paul frequently and talked with
him. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >After two years had passed, Felix was
succeeded by Porcius Festus. And wishing to do the Jews a favor,
Felix left Paul in prison. </font>
