<div class="calibre2"><p class="hdg">Tertullus Prosecutes Paul</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">1</span>Five days later the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a lawyer<span class="fn">a</span>  named Tertullus, who presented to the governor their case against Paul.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>When Paul had been called in, Tertullus opened the prosecution: “Because of you, we have enjoyed a lasting peace, and your foresight has brought improvements to this nation.
<span class="reftext">3</span>In every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with all gratitude.
<span class="reftext">4</span>But in order not to burden you any further, I beg your indulgence to hear us briefly.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>We have found this man to be a pestilence, stirring up dissension among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,
<span class="reftext">6</span>and he even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.<span class="fn">b</span> 

<span class="reftext">8</span>By examining him yourself, you will be able to learn the truth about all our charges against him.”
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>The Jews concurred, asserting that these charges were true.
</p><p class="hdg">Paul’s <span class='spell ca'>Defence</span><span class='spell gb'>Defence</span><span class='spell us'>Defense</span> to Felix</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">10</span>When the governor motioned for Paul to speak, he began his response: “Knowing that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly make my <span class='spell ca'>defence</span><span class='spell gb'>defence</span><span class='spell us'>defense</span>.
<span class="reftext">11</span>You can verify for yourself that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
<span class="reftext">12</span>Yet my accusers did not find me debating with anyone in the temple or riling up a crowd in the synagogues or in the city.
<span class="reftext">13</span>Nor can they prove to you any of their charges against me.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">14</span>I do confess to you, however, that I worship the God of our fathers according to the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is laid down by the <span class='cap'>Law</span><span class='nocap'>law</span> and written in the <span class='cap'>Prophets</span><span class='nocap'>prophets</span>,
<span class="reftext">15</span>and I have the same hope in God that they themselves cherish, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
<span class="reftext">16</span>In this hope, I strive always to maintain a clear conscience before God and man.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>After several years, then, I returned to Jerusalem to bring alms to my people and to present offerings.
<span class="reftext">18</span>At the time they found me in the temple, I was ceremonially clean and was not inciting a crowd or an uproar. But there are some Jews from the province of Asia<span class="fn">c</span> 
<span class="reftext">19</span>who ought to appear before you and bring charges, if they have anything against me.
<span class="reftext">20</span>Otherwise, let these men state for themselves any crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin,<span class="fn">d</span> 
<span class="reftext">21</span>unless it was this one thing I called out as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before <span class='youpl' data-word='you'>you</span> today.’<span class="thinq"> </span>”
</p><p class="hdg">The Verdict Postponed</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then Felix, who was well informed about the Way, adjourned the hearing and said, “When Lysias the commander comes, I will decide <span class='youpl' data-word='your'>your</span> case.”
<span class="reftext">23</span>He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard, but to allow him some freedom and permit his friends to minister to his needs.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>After several days, Felix returned with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.
<span class="reftext">25</span>As Paul expounded on righteousness, self-control, and the coming <span class='spell ca'>judgment</span><span class='spell gb'>judgement</span><span class='spell us'>judgment</span>, Felix became frightened and said, “You may go for now. When I find the time, I will call for you.”
<span class="reftext">26</span>At the same time, he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe. So he sent for Paul frequently and talked with him.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">27</span>After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And wishing to do the Jews a <span class='spell ca'>favour</span><span class='spell gb'>favour</span><span class='spell us'>favor</span>, Felix left Paul in prison.</p></div><div class="fn"><a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="fn"></a><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><b class="calibre4">Footnotes:</b><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><span class="fnverse">1</span> <span class="footnotesbot">a</span> Or <i class="calibre6">an orator</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">6</span> <span class="footnotesbot">b</span> BYZ and TR include <i class="calibre6">and we would have judged him according to our law. <span class="fnv">7</span>But Lysias the commander came with great force and took him out of our hands, <span class="fnv">8</span>ordering his accusers to come before you.</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">18</span> <span class="footnotesbot">c</span> Literally <i class="calibre6">from Asia</i>; Asia was a Roman province in what is now western Turkey. <p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><span class="fnverse">20</span> <span class="footnotesbot">d</span> Or <i class="calibre6">the Council</i><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre2" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p></div>
