<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Now the men of Israel had sworn an oath at
Mizpah, saying, “Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage
to a Benjamite.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the people came to Bethel and sat there
before God until evening, lifting up their voices and weeping
bitterly. “Why, O LORD God of Israel,” they cried out, “has
this happened in Israel? Today in Israel one tribe is missing!” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The next day the people got up early,
built an altar there, and presented burnt offerings and peace
offerings. The Israelites asked, “Who among all the tribes of
Israel did not come to the assembly before the LORD?” For they had
taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to come up before the LORD
at Mizpah would surely be put to death. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">And the Israelites grieved for their
brothers, the Benjamites, and said, “Today a tribe is cut off from
Israel. What should we do about wives for the survivors, since we
have sworn by the LORD not to give them our daughters in marriage?”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they asked, “Which one of the tribes
of Israel failed to come up before the LORD at Mizpah?” And, in
fact, no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the camp for the
assembly. For when the people were counted, none of the residents of
Jabesh-gilead were there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So the congregation sent 12,000 of their
most valiant men and commanded them: “Go and put to the sword those
living in Jabesh-gilead, including women and children. This is what
you are to do: Devote to destruction every male, as well as every
female who has had relations with a man.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they found among the inhabitants of
Jabesh-gilead four hundred young women who had not had relations with
a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of
Canaan. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the whole congregation sent a message
of peace to the Benjamites who were at the rock of Rimmon. And at
that time the Benjamites returned and were given the women who were
spared from Jabesh-gilead. But there were not enough women for all of
them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The people grieved for Benjamin, because
the LORD had made a void in the tribes of Israel. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">Then the elders of the congregation said,
“What should we do about wives for those who remain, since the
women of Benjamin have been destroyed?” They added, “There must
be heirs for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe of Israel
will not be wiped out. But we cannot give them our daughters as
wives.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">For the Israelites had sworn, “Cursed is
he who gives a wife to a Benjamite.” </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
“<font face="Tahoma, serif">But look,” they said, “there is a
yearly feast to the LORD in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel east of
the road that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">So they commanded the Benjamites: “Go,
hide in the vineyards and watch. When you see the daughters of Shiloh
come out to perform their dances, each of you is to come out of the
vineyards, catch for himself a wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and
go to the land of Benjamin. When their fathers or brothers come to us
to complain, we will tell them, ‘Do us a favor by helping them,
since we did not get wives for each of them in the war. Since you did
not actually give them your daughters, you have no guilt.’<font size="1" style="font-size: 7pt"> </font>”
</font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">The Benjamites did as instructed and
carried away the number of women they needed from the dancers they
caught. They went back to their own inheritance, rebuilt their
cities, and settled in them. And at that time, each of the Israelites
returned from there to his own tribe and clan, each to his own
inheritance. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm; line-height: 0.51cm">
<font face="Tahoma, serif">In those days there was no king in Israel;
everyone did what was right in his own eyes. </font>
