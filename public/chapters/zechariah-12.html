<i><font >This is the burden of the word of the
LORD concerning Israel. </font></i>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Thus declares the LORD, who stretches out
the heavens and lays the foundation of the earth, who forms the
spirit of man within him: </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
“<font >Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of
drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples. Judah will be besieged,
as well as Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On that day, when all the nations of the
earth gather against her, I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all
the peoples; all who would heave it away will be severely injured. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On that day, declares the LORD, I will
strike every horse with panic, and every rider with madness. I will
keep a watchful eye on the house of Judah, but I will strike with
blindness all the horses of the nations. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then the leaders of Judah will say in
their hearts: ‘The people of Jerusalem are my strength, for the
LORD of Hosts is their God.’ </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On that day I will make the clans of Judah
like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among the sheaves;
they will consume all the peoples around them on the right and on the
left, while the people of Jerusalem remain secure there. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >The LORD will save the tents of Judah
first, so that the glory of the house of David and of the people of
Jerusalem may not be greater than that of Judah. On that day the LORD
will defend the people of Jerusalem, so that the weakest among them
will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the
angel of the LORD going before them. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >So on that day I will set out to destroy
all the nations that come against Jerusalem. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >Then I will pour out on the house of David
and on the people of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and prayer, and they
will look on Me, the One they have pierced. They will mourn for Him
as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for Him as one
grieves for a firstborn son. </font>
</p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm">
<font >On that day the wailing in Jerusalem will
be as great as the wailing of Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
The land will mourn, each clan on its own: the clan of the house of
David and their wives, the clan of the house of Nathan and their
wives, the clan of the house of Levi and their wives, the clan of
Shimei and their wives, and all the remaining clans and their wives. </font>
