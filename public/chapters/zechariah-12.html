</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>“Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples. Judah will be besieged, as well as Jerusalem.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>On that day, when all the nations of the earth gather against her, I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who would heave it away will be severely injured.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">4</span>On that day, declares <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span>, I will strike every horse with panic, and every rider with madness. I will keep a watchful eye on the house of Judah, but I will strike with blindness all the horses of the nations.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then the leaders of Judah will say in their hearts: ‘The people of Jerusalem are my strength, for <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> of Hosts is their God.’
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among the sheaves; they will consume all the peoples around them on the right and on the left, while the people of Jerusalem remain secure there.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span><span class="lord" data-name="The LORD">The LORD</span> will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and of the people of Jerusalem may not be greater than that of Judah.
<span class="reftext">8</span>On that day <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> will defend the people of Jerusalem, so that the weakest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel<span class="fn">a</span>  of <span class="lord" data-name="the LORD">the LORD</span> going before them.
</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>So on that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
