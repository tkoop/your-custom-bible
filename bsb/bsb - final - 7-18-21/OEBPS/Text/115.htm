<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a><span class="reftext">5</span>You are not to reap the aftergrowth of your harvest or gather the grapes of your untended vines. The land must have a year of complete rest.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a><span class="reftext">6</span>Whatever the land yields during the Sabbath year shall be food for you—for yourself, your manservant and maidservant, the hired hand or foreigner who stays with you,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a><span class="reftext">7</span>and for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. All its growth may serve as food.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">11</span>The fiftieth year will be a Jubilee for you; you are not to sow the land or reap its aftergrowth or harvest the untended vines.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a><span class="reftext">12</span>For it is a Jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You may eat only the crops taken directly from the field.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a><span class="reftext">15</span>You are to buy from your neighbor according to the number of years since the last Jubilee; he is to sell to you according to the number of harvest years remaining.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="24"></a><span class="reftext">24</span>Thus for every piece of property you possess, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>If your brother becomes impoverished and sells some of his property, his nearest of kin may come and redeem what his brother has sold.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="26"></a><span class="reftext">26</span>Or if a man has no one to redeem it for him, but he prospers and acquires enough to redeem his land,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="27"></a><span class="reftext">27</span>he shall calculate the years since its sale, repay the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and return to his property.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="28"></a><span class="reftext">28</span>But if he cannot obtain enough to repay him, what he sold will remain in possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. In the Jubilee, however, it is to be released, so that he may return to his property.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="29"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>If a man sells a house in a walled city, he retains his right of redemption until a full year after its sale; during that year it may be redeemed.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="30"></a><span class="reftext">30</span>If it is not redeemed by the end of a full year, then the house in the walled city is permanently transferred to its buyer and his descendants. It is not to be released in the Jubilee.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="31"></a><span class="reftext">31</span>But houses in villages with no walls around them are to be considered as open fields. They may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="32"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the cities they possess.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="33"></a><span class="reftext">33</span>So whatever belongs to the Levites may be redeemed—a house sold in a city they possess—and must be released in the Jubilee, because the houses in the cities of the Levites are their possession among the Israelites.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="34"></a><span class="reftext">34</span>But the open pastureland around their cities may not be sold, for this is their permanent possession.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="37"></a><span class="reftext">37</span>You must not lend him your silver at interest or sell him your food for profit.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="38"></a><span class="reftext">38</span>I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="40"></a><span class="reftext">40</span>Let him stay with you as a hired worker or temporary resident; he is to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="41"></a><span class="reftext">41</span>Then he and his children are to be released, and he may return to his clan and to the property of his fathers.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="42"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">42</span>Because the Israelites are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, they are not to be sold as slaves.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="43"></a><span class="reftext">43</span>You are not to rule over them harshly, but you shall fear your God.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="44"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>Your menservants and maidservants shall come from the nations around you, from whom you may purchase them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="45"></a><span class="reftext">45</span>You may also purchase them from the foreigners residing among you or their clans living among you who are born in your land. These may become your property.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="46"></a><span class="reftext">46</span>You may leave them to your sons after you to inherit as property; you can make them slaves for life. But as for your brothers, the Israelites, no man may rule harshly over his brother.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="47"></a></p><p class="hdg">Redemption of Servants</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">47</span>If a foreigner residing among you prospers, but your countryman dwelling near him becomes destitute and sells himself to the foreigner or to a member of his clan,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="48"></a><span class="reftext">48</span>he retains the right of redemption after he has sold himself. One of his brothers may redeem him:
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="49"></a><span class="reftext">49</span>either his uncle or cousin or any close relative from his clan may redeem him. Or if he prospers, he may redeem himself.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="50"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">50</span>He and his purchaser will then count the time from the year he sold himself up to the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale will be determined by the number of years, based on the daily wages of a hired hand.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="51"></a><span class="reftext">51</span>If many years remain, he must pay for his redemption in proportion to his purchase price.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="52"></a><span class="reftext">52</span>If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he is to calculate and pay his redemption according to his remaining years.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="53"></a><span class="reftext">53</span>He shall be treated like a man hired from year to year, but a foreign owner must not rule over him harshly in your sight.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="54"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">54</span>Even if he is not redeemed in any of these ways, he and his children shall be released in the Year of Jubilee.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="55"></a><span class="reftext">55</span>For the Israelites are My servants. They are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt.
