Then all the Israelites returned to their cities, each to his own property.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">2</span>Hezekiah reestablished the divisions of the priests and Levites—each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites—for the burnt offerings and peace offerings, for ministry, for giving thanks, and for singing praises at the gates of the LORD’s dwelling.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a></p><p class="hdg">Contributions for Worship</p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>The king contributed from his own possessions for the regular morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons, and appointed feasts, as written in the Law of the LORD.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a><span class="reftext">4</span>Moreover, he commanded the people living in Jerusalem to make a contribution for the priests and Levites so that they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously provided the firstfruits of the grain, new wine, oil, and honey, and of all the produce of the field, and they brought in an abundance—a tithe of everything.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a><span class="reftext">6</span>And the Israelites and Judahites who lived in the cities of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things consecrated to the LORD their God, and they laid them in large heaps.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">7</span>In the third month they began building up the heaps, and they finished in the seventh month.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a><span class="reftext">8</span>When Hezekiah and his officials came and viewed the heaps, they blessed the LORD and His people Israel.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and Levites about the heaps,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a><span class="reftext">10</span>and Azariah, the chief priest of the household of Zadok, answered him, “Since the people began to bring their contributions into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and there is plenty left over, because the LORD has blessed His people; this great abundance is what is left over.”

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a><span class="reftext">12</span>And they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes, and dedicated gifts. Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them, and his brother Shimei was second.
