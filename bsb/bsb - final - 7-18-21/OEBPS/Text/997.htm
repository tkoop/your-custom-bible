<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a><span class="reftext">2</span>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a><span class="reftext">3</span>but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="4"></a><span class="reftext">4</span>While they were puzzling over this, suddenly two men in radiant apparel stood beside them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>As the women bowed their faces to the ground in terror, the two men asked them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a><span class="reftext">6</span>He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee:
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a><span class="reftext">7</span><span>‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’</span>”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then they remembered His words.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="9"></a><span class="reftext">9</span>And when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="10"></a><span class="reftext">10</span>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="11"></a><span class="reftext">11</span>But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="12"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">12</span>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a><span class="reftext">14</span>They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a><span class="reftext">15</span>And as they talked and deliberated, Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a><span class="reftext">16</span>But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>He asked them, <span>“What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?”</span> </p><p class="reg1"> They stood still, with sadness on their faces.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a><span class="reftext">18</span>One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">19</span>“What things?”</span> He asked. </p><p class="reg1">“The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a><span class="reftext">20</span>Our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and they crucified Him.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="21"></a><span class="reftext">21</span>But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning,
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="23"></a><span class="reftext">23</span>but they did not find His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="24"></a><span class="reftext">24</span>Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did not see.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span>“O foolish ones, how slow are your hearts to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="26"></a><span class="reftext">26</span>Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then to enter His glory?”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="27"></a><span class="reftext">27</span>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was written in all the Scriptures about Himself.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="28"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">28</span>As they approached the village where they were headed, He seemed to be going farther.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="29"></a><span class="reftext">29</span>But they pleaded with Him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.” </p><p class="reg1"> So He went in to stay with them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="30"></a><span class="reftext">30</span>While He was reclining at the table with them, He took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="31"></a><span class="reftext">31</span>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus—and He disappeared from their sight.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="32"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">32</span>They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us as He spoke with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="33"></a><span class="reftext">33</span>And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. </p><p class="reg1"> There they found the Eleven and those with them, gathered together
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="34"></a><span class="reftext">34</span>and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon!”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="35"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">35</span>Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how they had recognized Jesus in the breaking of the bread.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="37"></a><span class="reftext">37</span>But they were startled and frightened, thinking they had seen a spirit.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="38"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span><span class="reftext">38</span>“Why are you troubled,”</span> Jesus asked, <span>“and why do doubts arise in your hearts?

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="40"></a><span class="reftext">40</span>And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="41"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">41</span>While they were still in disbelief because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, <span>“Do you have anything here to eat?”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="42"></a><span class="reftext">42</span>So they gave Him a piece of broiled fish,<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">c</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="43"></a><span class="reftext">43</span>and He took it and ate it in front of them.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="44"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">44</span>Jesus said to them, <span>“These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.”</span>
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="45"></a><span class="reftext">45</span>Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="46"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">46</span>And He told them, <span>“This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,
