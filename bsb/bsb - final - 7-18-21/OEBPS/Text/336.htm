<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="2"></a><span class="reftext">2</span>And he went up to the house of the LORD with all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the priests and the prophets—all the people small and great—and in their hearing he read all the words of the Book of the Covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="3"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">3</span>So the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD to follow the LORD and to keep His commandments, decrees, and statutes with all his heart and all his soul, and to carry out the words of this covenant that were written in this book.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="5"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">5</span>Josiah also did away with the idolatrous priests ordained by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem—those who had burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="6"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">6</span>He brought the Asherah pole from the house of the LORD to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem, and there he burned it, ground it to powder, and threw its dust on the graves of the common people.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="7"></a><span class="reftext">7</span>He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the house of the LORD, where the women had woven tapestries for Asherah.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="8"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then Josiah brought all the priests from the cities of Judah and desecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="13"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">13</span>The king also desecrated the high places east of Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Corruption, which King Solomon of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">e</a></span>  the abomination of the Ammonites.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="14"></a><span class="reftext">14</span>He smashed the sacred pillars to pieces, cut down the Asherah poles, and covered the sites with human bones.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="15"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">15</span>He even pulled down the altar at Bethel, the high place set up by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin. Then he burned<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">f</a></span>  the high place, ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="16"></a><span class="reftext">16</span>And as Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there on the hillside, and he sent someone to take the bones out of the tombs, and he burned them on the altar to defile it, according to the word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God who had foretold these things.<span class="fn"><a href="#fn" class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3">g</a></span> 
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="17"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then the king asked, “What is this monument I see?” </p><p class="reg1"> And the men of the city replied, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced these things that you have done to the altar of Bethel.”
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="18"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">18</span>“Let him rest,” said Josiah. “Do not let anyone disturb his bones.” </p><p class="reg1"> So they left his bones undisturbed, along with those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="19"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">19</span>Just as Josiah had done at Bethel, so also in the cities of Samaria he removed all the shrines of the high places set up by the kings of Israel who had provoked the LORD to anger.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="20"></a><span class="reftext">20</span>On the altars he slaughtered all the priests of the high places, and he burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="22"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">22</span>No such Passover had been observed from the days of the judges who had governed Israel through all the days of the kings of Israel and Judah.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="23"></a><span class="reftext">23</span>But in the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, this Passover was observed to the LORD in Jerusalem.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="24"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">24</span>Furthermore, Josiah removed the mediums and spiritists, the household gods and idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. He did this to carry out the words of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of the LORD.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="25"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">25</span>Neither before nor after Josiah was there any king like him, who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, according to all the Law of Moses.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="26"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">26</span>Nevertheless, the LORD did not turn away from the fury of His burning anger, which was kindled against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to provoke Him to anger.
<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="27"></a><span class="reftext">27</span>For the LORD had said, “I will remove Judah from My sight, just as I removed Israel.

<a class="pcalibre2 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre3" id="29"></a></p><p class="reg1"><span class="reftext">29</span>At the end of Josiah’s reign, Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt marched up to help the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River.
